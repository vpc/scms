<h2>Counter That Pokemon</h2>

<h3>What was it?</h3>

<p>Counter That Pokemon was originally a project created in the UU forum,  which was then adapted to the other tiers. The basic idea was for the  community to create two separate teams, designed to "counter: each  other.  OU was rather late to run this project, however NixHex decided  it was time to give it a go, and as such, it recently got developed.</p>

<h3>How it Turned Out</h3>

<h4>Team #1</h4>

<p><strong>First Pick</strong></p>

<p>In beginning of Counter This Pokemon, Team #1 needed to select a Pokemon. Many Pokemon were nominated, however, it was quickly determined  that leading with a weather dependent Pokemon would lead to problems in  the future, with Team #2 being able to counter with Swift Swimmers, or  opposing weather. As such, Pokemon that could work well in many  different types of weather such as Terrakion and Latias proved popular.  In the end, however, many users decided to support ginganinja’s  nomination of Meloetta, which many users wanted to see work in OU, and  many felt that thanks to Meloetta's forme changing abilities, it would  provide some difficulty to be countered. Meloetta also opened up the  opportunity for Team #1 to pick Politoed later in the project, letting  Meloetta abuse a 100% accurate Serene Grace Thunder, something that  could have the potential to be troublesome.</p>

<h4>Team #2</h4>

<p><strong>First Pick</strong></p>

<p>Right from the start, Team #2 had a tricky time countering Meloetta.  Sableye was initially suggested, but the threat of Rain, and the fact  that Thunder easily 2HKOed led people to turn to alternative options.  Celebi and Latias were the frontrunners due to their ability to easily  switch in, shrug off the damage, and threaten to boost themselves.  Psychics themselves were very popular in this stage, as Cresselia,  Gothitelle, and Deoxys-D were all suggested as well, primarily due to the  fact that they could switch into a LO Psychic or Close Combat depending  on what forme Meloetta was in. This stage was rather messy, since  people initially did not realise that they were building a "team" and  not just strictly trying to counter Meloetta. As a result, NixHex threw  out many of the nominations that he felt were too gimmicky. In the  voting stage, it was Pockets unusual NP + Thunder Wave Celebi which won  the most support due to it utterly walling Meloetta, while threatening  to cripple anything Team #1 could switch in with Thunder Wave, while  also threatening to sweep Team #1 clean with Nasty Plot. Access to  Natural Cure also frustrated Meloetta, due to it avoiding any possible  status that Thunder or Relic Song could inflict.</p>

<h4>Team #2</h4>

<p><strong>Second Pick</strong></p>

<p>Team #2 now got a second pick, and it had the option of choosing anything. The community debated as to what would work best, with Heatran  and Terrakion being some of the earlier nominations. This stage was  also when support of a weather starter began to pick up, with many  arguing that selecting Tyranitar or Hippowdon would limit Team #1 from  selecting Politoed and easily winning the weather war. At this time,  there was a very strong fear of Team #1 picking Tornadus-T, which would destroy Celebi, thus, support of some sort of Steel-type was high. After  a close run voting period, Skore's specially defensive Heatran won out,  just edging out DrunkDemon's Sub Salac Terrakion by a single vote.  Heatran was a more conservative choice for Team #2, as it was chosen due  to its excellent synergy with Celebi, as well as its access to the  ever important Stealth Rock. Team #2 was clearly unsure as to what  direction it wanted to focus its teambuilding towards, and felt that  Heatran gave them a lot more options that Terrakion did.</p>

<h4>Team #1</h4>

<p><strong>Second Pick</strong></p>

<p>It was time for Team #1 to pick their second Pokemon, and many found it  tricky to handle the powerful CeleTran Core which Team #2 had at their  disposal. Of more concern was the fact that both Heatran and Celebi  could cripple a switch-in with a burn or paralysis; this made the number  of choices very small, as it was thought that there was very little  that could switch into this core and not care about either  status. The community quickly discovered Heatran as an excellent option  for utterly walling the opposing Heatran on Team #2, as well as walling  Celebi and giving Team #1 Stealth Rock. It was a good idea, but it was  an idea constructed by Team #2. Pocket and Skore had constructed their  submissions in order to encourage Team #1 to select a Heatran, thus  giving them a less than useful pokemon if they eventually decided to use  Rain. It was a clever tactic, but it ultimately backfired when  ginganinja discovered NP Thundurus-T could use Celebi for set up fodder,  and nuke the CeleTran Core with its powerful attacks.</p>

<p>It was around this time that the discussion picked up massively, as  people began to understand what the project was about, and people took  it upon themselves to discuss each nomination and point out strengths  and weaknesses. Xelacalle and ganj4lF were but two posters who did this  quite a lot, and this encouraged other people to do the same, which  enabled people to make better submissions to each team. Team #1 ended up  picking the ginganinja nomination of Thundurus-T after it blitzed the  voting in record time.</p>

<h4>Team #1</h4>

<p><strong>Third Pick</strong></p>

<p>Team #1 felt that they had a good advantage over Team #1 already, and  Xelacalle decided that Team #1 should focus on looking at what Team #2  might use to counter Thundurus-T (and Meloetta), and decided to  encourage the community to select something that would "counter" any  counters that Team #2 might use to beat Thundurus-T. This sort of  foresight was exactly what the OU staff wanted to encourage, as it fostered strategic thinking among the community, as well as thinking  ahead, useful  skills both in teambuilding and in battle. Latias was  quickly pinpointed as a major threat to Team #1, which lead to some  serious consideration for pokemon such as Jirachi and Scizor to handle  it. The community quickly discovered that finding a pokemon that  countered Latias, but was successful against Heatran and Celebi, was  exceptionally tricky. Jirachi, Genesect, Scizor, and Metagross were all  discussed and popular. In the end, the community was worried  that selecting 3 specially biased sweepers would be a mistake, and as  such, in a close vote, opted for the powerful Choice Band Metagross to  handle a possible Latias that Team #2 might use, while giving Team #1 an  excellent physical sweeper in case Team #2 opted for a special wall.</p>

<h4>Team #2</h4>

<p><strong>Third Pick</strong></p>

<p>This stage was characterised by an excellent post from Electrolyte,  which stated that Team #2 had to pick a team style, due to Celebi and  Heatran forming an excellent core that could work on balanced or stall.  At this stage, weather starters such as Tyrantiar, Hippowdon, and  Ninetales were commonly nominated to better counter the possible  Politoed that Team #1 would pick. The downside to these nominations was  that Team #1 could actually handle many of those weather starters in  their 3 pokemon core, with Thundurus and Meloetta threatening the above  pokemon with their powerful special attacks. Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and  Jellicent were also very popular suggestions, as both completed the F/G  core that Team #2 currently had, while providing a solid balanced core  which, on paper, could handle most attacking types. Magnezone was also  a massively popular choice, which, while not patching up the weaknesses  of Team #2, opened up the possibility for Latias for the next pick,  severely threatening Team #1 as Latias could shut down Meloetta and  Thundurus-T fairly easily. Again, the voting was tight, but this time  most of the community decided on a Scarf Rotom-W, which could revenge  kill Thundurus-T and Meloetta while easily walling Metagross. This was a  clever pick, since it also fared well against Rain if Team #1 selected  Politoed, and Trick was also a good move to have to shut down wall Team  #1 might use to counter Rotom-W.</p>

<h4>Team #2</h4>

<p><strong>Fourth Pick</strong></p>

<p>Like the previous stage, Electrolyte posted early on, deciding that Team  #2 needed a physical hitter due to every single member hitting on the  special side of things. The focus "physical hitter" was rather vague  and as such, many physical hitters were nominated, such as Mamoswine and  Terrakion, both of which threatened to rip through Team #1, which  currently lacked any real defensive pivot or wall. Electrolyte's  Mamoswine was a landslide victory, and was an excellent pick, due to it  shutting down any other weather Team #2 might use (matching up well  against Ninetales, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar). This was an excellent  tactical decision since it forced Team #1 into Politoed becoming more  and more likely, which Team  #2 could then exploit by loading up on Rain  counters / checks. As a bonus, Mamoswine also shut down any dragons  Team #1 might use (which was an excellent prediction by Electrolyte,  since he realised that many Rotom-W counters were weak to Mamoswine),  and checked Tornadus-T, the main powerhouse of Rain, while also handling  Metagross and Thudurus-T. In short, Mamoswine was a very strong pick  for Team #2, a pick that would frustrate Team #1 in the future.</p>

<h4>Team #1</h4>

<p><strong>Fourth Pick</strong></p>

<p>It was time for Team #1 to pick, and I believe it was at this point that  people were slightly confused as to how to handle Team #2's recent  selections. Both Rotom-W and Mamoswine could handle or revenge kill much  of Team #1 and it was tough to find a counter to these pokemon that  didn't instantly lose to other members of Team #2. It was clear to  everyone, that Team #1 had Thundurus-T as their "ace," however it was  now checked by two members of Team #2 and, as such, they needed to think  defensively to counter the dual threats of Mamoswine and Rotom-W. I  think the community was a little downhearted as there was some  discussion as to whether Metagross was the correct pick for Team #1 the  previous round. Regardless, a pokemon had to be selected. Infernape  and Kyurem were the dominant choices for Team #1 in the voting stage.  Infernape was initially very popular, however, ginganinja hijacked the  voting, claiming that Team #1 absolutely needed a water resist. Momentum swung toward Kyurem, which went on to win the voting in a  close finish. As a result of nominating (and winning) 3 out of the 4 team members for  Team #1. Ginganinja effectively became the captain for Team #1 after  this vote, while the Team Captain for Team #2 was still undecided.</p>

<h4>Team #1</h4>

<p><strong>Fifth Pick</strong></p>

<p>Hazards, was the focus of this part of Team #1. Many believed that a  possible Dragonite / Volcarona pick could be damaging to Team #1, and as  such, people really wanted a Stealth Rocker for this pick, as people  wanted the sixth and final slot to be open to a last minute Politoed,  which would prevent Team #2 from countering it easily. The stage was  also characterised by a discussion on a rapid spinner. People were aware  that team #1 had only 2 picks left and that they needed hazards, a  spinner (due to having 2 SR weak pokemon), and rain support from  Politoed. This lead to an intense discussion towards the end of the  nomination phase as to whether Thundurus-T and Kyurem could function  without a spinner, and it was eventually argued that if we put enough  offensive pressure on Team #2, and on Heatran, we could prevent Stealth  Rock going up, thus preventing it from hampering Thundurus-T and Kyurem.  This discussion was rather significant since it announced a shift in the  way the community was thinking. Instead of focusing on full out  countering Pokemon, checking and putting offensive pressure on the  opposing team were foremost ideas in the communities mind, as people  came to realise that 100% counters were not always the best options, and  that pokemon that checked and retained momentum were possibly better.</p>

<p>Nominations were rather scarce in this round, and the community made an  almost unanimous decision in favour of SR Terrakion, submitted by  alexwolf. Terrakion was the popular pick due to it being able to KO  every single member of Team #2. It also put pressure on Celebi, the  team's only fighting resist, and threatened to weaken it enough that  Meloetta could attempt a Relic Song sweep, or at least rip through the  lineup of Team #2.</p>

<h4>Team #2</h4>

<p><strong>Fifth Pick</strong></p>

<p>Faced with the powerful Terrakion hampering their own Heatran, as well  threatening to set up Stealth Rock if it got a free switch (which  wouldn’t be too hard), Team #2 realised it needed a hard counter to  Terrakion, or at least a check, lest it clean sweep them.  Team #2 were  also worried about the recent Sub Roost Kyurem pick for Team #1, which  could set up a sub on Rotom-W and Celebi and threaten both Heatran and  Mamoswine with a powerful Earth Power. Scizor, Landorus-T, and Breloom  were the popular suggestions, as all three could threaten Team #1, and  as a bonus, could also frustrate Politoed, which was looking like a more  and more certain pick for Team #1. All three threatened to sweep after a  respective boost (Breloom and Scizor with SD, Landorus-T with a Rock  Polish boost), however the voting stage proved interesting, as CB Scizor  and SD Scizor ended the voting period on an equal number of votes, which  led to NixHex having the decisive vote. He eventually decided on CB Scizor, submitted by Temp V1.</p>

<p>The choice by Team #2 to pick Scizor has actually been recently debated  in the Counter This Pokemon thread. Several players wondered if Scizor  was perhaps the best option, and there are arguments both for and  against this. It is my opinion that Kyurem and Terrakion put Team #2  under tremendous pressure, which almost shoved them toward Scizor, since  it was one of the few pokemon that could go head to head with both.  Breloom and Landorus-T were weak to Ice, so while on paper they could  check Terrakion, in practice Team #1 could exploit this weakness to  Kyurem by consistently bringing in Meloetta, forcing in Celebi, which  could then be vulnerable to Kyurem setting up a free Substitute, and  snatching back a KO. CB Scizor prevented this from becoming a factor, as  its Bullet Punch shut down Kyurem, while also providing more priority  for Team #2 in revenge killing threats.</p>

<h4>Team #2</h4>

<p><strong>Sixth (and final) Pick</strong></p>

<p>This was the final Pokemon for Team #2, and there was quite a lot riding  on it. Team #1 had one slot left, and the community was well aware that  Politoed was looking to be a very likely choice for Team #1. Aided by  this knowledge, there was a community wide effort to find something that  could sweep Team #1 cold, as well as the possible future Politoed Team  #1 might add. The discussionion was not just limited to this; many  users had also illustrated the various weaknesses of Team #2, just in  case Team #1 avoided Politoed, and decided that Infernape and Volcarona  were various threats to the team. There was minor controversy,  as Team #2 decided to nominate the not currently OU Garchomp, which would  utterly dominate Team #1 if allowed. NixHex and newly appointed moderator ginganinja did eventually rule that  since Garchomp was technically uber at the time, it should not be  allowed, but there was no denying that Garchomp would have caused a  severe headache for Team #1.</p>

<p>I think, at this late stage, the community was unsure as to what was  best for Team #2. They had done a great job of listing the various  problems they suffered from, but lacked one strong pokemon that could  100% counter all of them. Personally, I believe that some of the  threats, such as Volcarona, were threatening on paper, and could be  played around; however it's a personal opinion, and you can make your  own interpretations. Regardless, Temp V1 and alexwolf did a joint  submission in the form of LO Infernape, and it was an excellent pick.  Infernape put Team #1 in a tough position as it cleanly KOed every  single member while also dealing heavy damage to Politoed. It was a  crafty pick, since defensive Politoed could be easily handled by Celebi,  which Team #1 could counter with Thundurus, which Team #2 could handle  with Mamoswine, forcing a possible KO. On the only hand, Scarf Toed  couldn't really switch into Infernape, and it would be forced to use its  water STAB, something that Celebi could take without too much trouble,  giving Team #2 excellent momentum. As a bonus, Infernape could also  revenge Terrakion with Mach Punch. From my perspective, Team #2 was very  much built around using its excellent FWG core to wall threats, and  then strike back hard with Mamoswine and Infernape, blasting through  Team #1, abusing the fact that they lacked a strong defensive core. Team  #2 seemed unstoppable, and was in an excellent position with Team #1  having the final pick. How would they respond???</p>

<p>At this stage, despite Temp V1 and Electrolyte submitting the exact  same number of Pokemon on Team #2, Electrolyte was made team Captain,  with Temp V1 the back-up).</p>

<h4>Team #1</h4>

<p><strong>Sixth (and final) Pick</strong></p>

<p>As stated above, Team #1 had their work cut out for them. The stage was  pretty much defined by a massive tl;dr post by ginganinja, which  analyzed both strengths and weaknesses of both teams, and then nominated  Conkeldurr, which was exceptionally hard for Team #2 to revenge kill. The  Conkeldurr nomination was favourable to pretty much everyone, but then  ganj4lF basically stole the show with an excellent nomination of  Deoxys-D with HP Fire + Fire Gem, This totally wrecked Team #2, as well  as walling Infernape. It was fairly ironic as everyone had twisted  themselves up into looking at full offensive threats, and Team #2 had  entirely neglected to think of the defensive threats, and Deoxys-D  threatened to destroy Team #2 with Spikes. Alas, as a final pick, there  was actually nothing Team #2 could do to counter this, as Team #1  utterly ignored the Politoed nominations (which had previously looked so  likely) in favour of Deoxys-D, which became the final member of Team #1.</p>

<h3>Team Breakdown</h3>

<h4>Team #1</h4>

<p>Team #1 was pretty much pure Hyper Offense. I am unsure if the Meloetta  first pick directly encouraged this, but certainly it was an aggressive  choice! Between Deoxys-D and Terrakion, Team #1 had access to Stealth  Rock and Spikes, something that actually put Team #2 under a load of  pressure, due to most of their team being hit by Spikes. With Terrakion  and Thundurus-T, Team #1 had no shortage of heavy hitters, while  Metagross and Kyurem could also dish out the hurt. Despite the power  Team #1 packed, it actually had a few weaknesses that Team #2 could  exploit. Deoxys-D was their primary defensive wall; if it got hit with a  critical hit, Team #2 would be very vulnerable to counter attack. In  addition, Meloetta and Metagross especially struggled with many pokemon  on Team #2, limiting their chances to make an impact in the game.</p>

<h4>Team #2</h4>

<p>Team #2, I believe, was almost designed to be balanced. They had a strong  FWG Core and 3 priority users, which meant that they could revenge  kill any offensive threat that looked dangerous. Mamoswine acted as the  team's main powerhouse, as Team #1 lacked an effective answer to it.  Infernape was the team's back up sweeper and cleaner, KOing every single  member of Team #1 bar Deoxys-D, which made it a very large threat. On  the defensive side of things, Heatran threatened to set up Stealth Rock  to hurt Thundurus-T and Kyurem, while Celebi could administer paralysis  support or threaten a sweep with Nasty Plot. Despite having a well  balanced team that could revenge kill / check many offensive threats,  Team #2 did lack an effective answer to Deoxys-D, and Celebi, Rotom W,  and Heatran to an extent forfeited momentum to Thundurus-T, Kyurem, and  Terrakion respectively, Pokemon that Team #2 could ill afford to give  free turns to.</p>
     
<h3>THE BATTLE</h3>

<p>Electrolyte and ginganinja failed to find a time that would work for  both of them and, as such, Temp V1 took the place of Electrolyte, as he  had an excellent timezone with ginganinja. After a massive amount of  hype (nah im jk), the two players finally managed to battle on Pokemon Showdown!</p>

<h4>Battle #1 (The breakdown)</h4>

<p>The actual logs are posted in the thread, so feel free to go read them  if you want. Battle #1 was started with ginganinja leading with  Terrakion, while Temp V1 led with Heatran. ginganinja had the upper hand  matchup wise, and successfully nailed Heatran with a Close Combat, as  Temp V1 predicted a Stealth Rock from Terrakion. Rotom-W was then  brought in and quickly lost its Choice Scarf to Terrakion, which made it a lot  more difficult for Team 2 to handle Deoxys-D, which proceeded to wall  Infernape with ease. Thundurus managed to cripple Scizor and Rotom-W,  which made it even easier for Deoxys-D to wall Team #2. Temp V1  attempted to overwhelm Deoxys-D with Infernape Overheat + Mamoswine +  Scizor but ginganinja coolly sacrificed other team members to weaken the  Infernape overheat, and eventually won a few turns later, having  successfully LO stalled Infernape out.</p>

<h4>Battle #2 (The Breakdown)</h4>

<p>This battle was much longer than the previous one, as Temp V1 gained an  early advantage with Rotom-W matching up with Deoxys-D. Rotom-W again  lost its Choice Scarf to Kyurem on Turn 1 of the battle, and resulted in both  players attempting to predict each others moves. Team #1 lost Kyurem to a  well-played Mamoswine, however ginganinja struck back with a crippling  Close Combat on Scizor, effectively removing it from the match. Things  were evenly poised when Terrakion and Scizor matched up a few turns  later, Scizor on 1% health. ginganinja gained early advantage when he assumed  that Temp V1 would predict him going to Metagross as had happened in the previous battle,  so he stayed in to Close Combat and successfully hit Mamoswine on the  switch, KOing it. Nailing Mamoswine was a big victory for Team #1, and  when Terrakion managed to set up Stealth Rock, basically killing Scizor,  Deoxys-D was able to set up 3 layers of Spikes before dying, allowing  Thundurus-T to switch in and clean up (Infernape having fainted to LO +  hazards), giving ginganinja victory and bragging rights.</p>

<h3>So what did we learn?</h3>

<p>I personally feel that this project taught the community a few things.  For starters, it encouraged the community to think harder about finding  counters and checks for certain pokemon. For example, it's easy to find  specialised counters for certain Pokemon, but finding counters that  work in a team setting is a difficult task. Preserving Momentum was also  a big part of the project; sure, Blissey might wall 3 members of Team  X, however it would totally kill any momentum, and might be vulnerable  to Physical sweeper Y. It also encouraged people to think of offensive  checks, using offensive pressure and checks to handle some big  threats. Far too often we see the argument "but X has no counters" and  it's true. However, I think this project reflected that with smart  teambuilding, you can play around some threats by playing aggressively.  An example of this would be the Infernape selection on Team #2, which  utterly destroyed Team #1's intentions to pick Politoed, since Infernape  could just rip through Team #1 if Politoed was added. Other people  might have learned other stuff, and I would be happy to hear from them, but the above was just what I took away from this project.</p>

<h4>Are there any problems or flaws with the project that might need more discussion?</h4>

<p>I think that problem of the "last pick" is something that should be  discussed more. There was a strong opinion from many of the players that  watched the battle, that Deoxys-D as a last pick utterly destroyed Team  #2, thus giving Team #1 a massive advantage due to Team #2 being unable  to counter a final pick. This is actually a fair point, however I think  it's a problem that can be played around provided Team #2 is aggressive  in their teambuilding. For example, I can pinpoint the Heatran  selection by Team #2, as an opportunity missed, as it didn't really  threaten Team #2 offensively. It was a "passive" selection and therefore  didn't dictate teambuilding from Team #1 as much as it could have.
On the subject of weak picks, I honestly think both teams made mistakes  choice wise. I don't wish to single out any person / Pokemon, but for  example, Kyurem might not have been the greatest pick for Team #1. It  was a good water resist, and it could handle Ice attacks from Mamoswine,  however it failed to account for Rotom-W tricking it a Scarf, and as  such it could not use Earth Power without giving Rotom-W a free switch  in. This forced it to spam Ice Beam, which gave Scizor / Heatran / Infernape  good chances. I think that this is something that just happens, and something that can be easily avoided in the possible future.</p>

<h4>Future Suggestions</h4>

<p>The project was a massive success, and while it resulted in a fair  amount of work for all people involved, it could easily be run again.  Just something to take away, here are some observations that I made  during this project.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Think ahead and be aggressive with your selections.</strong><br />
This was something that (by and large) was done very well, as  Thundurus-T, Terrakion, Mamoswine, and Infernape were excellent choices  that forced both teams to adapt their teams a certain way. The more  aggressive your suggestion is (within reason), the more it limits the  options of the opposing team. Infernape, again, was the prime example of  this since it basically made Team #1 drop everything since they had to  counter it or get swept.</li>
<li><strong>When first picking</strong><br />
This is a personal thing, but if Team #1 is first picking, I do favour Pokemon that can function on a variety of team styles and have a  limited but effective number of counters. For example, something like  Terrakion as a first pick, I suspect would, derail the project, as its  typically such a hard pokemon to handle, perhaps leading to  decreased interest. I don't know for sure, but I just think Team #1 going  out of their way to select an exceptionally difficult Pokemon to  counter has the potential to wreck the challenge. Maybe that's up for  further discussion, idk.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful with weather.</strong><br />
This is a general note, but quite a lot of people brought up weather  during this project, and yet both teams ended up weatherless, primarily  due to the fear that the opposing team would easily counter them. This, I  feel, is something that is rather unique to the project. If you were  building a ladder team, weather is something that you would often add. In Counter This Pokemon, however, it's less popular due to the ease in  which the opposing team can counter you. I guess Scarfers are in a  similar boat, since once you pick them, then the opposing team can pick a  faster Scarfer and technically screw you over, etc. etc.</li>
<li><strong>Dictate Teambuilding</strong><br />
This, I feel, is the most important thing to bear in mind during the Counter This Pokemon project. Part of the reason why I think Team #1 was  so successful, was that it threatened to use Rain throughout the  project, keeping the option open right up until the end, which forced  Team #2 to run pokemon that would match up well against a possible Rain  team.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Words</h3>

<p>A massive thank you to everyone who participated, from  the OU mod NixHex who ran it, to the people like Temp V1, Pocket,  alexwolf, Electrolyte, Lavos Spawn, Xelacalle, and ganj4lF (sorry If I  missed you, please don't take offence) who all posted excellent, in  depth analyses from each nomination, to the people that actually  nominated and voted on stuff for either (or both) teams. Without you  guys, this project would not have been successful, so thanks to everyone  that got involved!</p>
