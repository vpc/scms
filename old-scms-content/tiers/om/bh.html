<h2>What is Balanced Hackmons?</h2>

<p>The idea behind <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3463764">Balanced Hackmons</a> is simple; any Pokemon can have any move, any ability, and 252 EVs in each stat. While this might seem overpowering, there are a few rules set in place to create a more balanced metagame. Firstly, five abilities are currently banned: Huge Power, Pure Power, Wonder Guard, Shadow Tag, and Arena Trap. Furthermore, all OHKO moves are banned. Because of its nature, Balanced Hackmons is an incredibly diverse tier filled to the brim with creativity.</p>

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wonder Guard, Pure Power, Huge Power, Shadow Tag, and Arena Trap are banned.</li>
<li>All clauses are off besides OHKO clause.</li>
</ul>
