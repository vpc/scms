Monthly Art Contest #17: Another Focus
[head]

[page]

<p>Most of us artists get tired of drawing the same ol' Pokemon shtick. Pokemon A fights Pokemon B while Trainer A screams and Trainer B calls out another Pokemon. This month's theme was to try to focus on something other than Pokemon, but still retaining the Pokemon. The artists try their best at creating how Pokemon would be without the battling gag.</p>
