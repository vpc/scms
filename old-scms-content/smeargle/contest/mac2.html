Monthly Art Contest #2: Green Evolution
[head]

[page]
<p>It shows the age of the MAC that its second theme was inspired by then-current affairs in the world of Pokemon: Black and White were rumored to be on the horizon; pictures of the new starters had been released; what would their evolutions be? That was a question that this theme aimed to solve: 'Green Evolution', a piece of art on what Snivy's final evolution could be. Needless to say, many of the submissions surpassed Serperior.</p>
