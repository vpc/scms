<h3>Who is Danmire?</h3>

<img src="/media/upload/smeargle/profiles/danmire_avy.png" alt="" />

<p>My name's Daniel. I am a 17 year old Highschool student currently studying for a career in Wildlife Biology. I have been interested in animals all my life, mostly the reptile species. Drawing has also been a big important part of my life even taking over my mind in career choices, but ultimately I chose the thing I love more than drawing. Oh yeah, I'm also a swimmer in a USA Swimming team.</p>

<p>I have been drawing for as long as I can remember, and I use a variety of styles from grunge, to realistic drawings, etc. I don't like sticking to one style, so it usually depends on my mood and what type of music I listen to.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>Meeting many friends and getting an artist badge for my work.</p>
