<h3>Who is Wyverii?</h3>

<p>Moderator of Create a Pokémon (CaP) and sprite art specialist.</p>

<p>I mostly hang out on IRC and stay within the CaP section on the smogon forums. I dabble in a wide range of arts and have a keen interest in ornithology. I occasionally get poked into making an art thread on the forums, but I do have a tendency to let them die.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>Pixel art used in sections of the CaP site. Also participates in design and spritework for CaP and helps with non-contest artwork such as sprite animation.</p>
