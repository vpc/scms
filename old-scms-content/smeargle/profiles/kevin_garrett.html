<h3>Who is Kevin Garrett?</h3>

<p>I've been on Smogon for several years as a battler. Art has always been a hobby for me going back to grade school. When The Smog was created and I joined the staff, I wanted to get involved with the art. This was my first time ever doing digital art. My early works were difficult to produce because I was using a mouse to draw in Photoshop Elements 2.0. That involved zooming the screen to 400% and erasing many of my lines until had a level of consistency I could live with. After I got serious about improving my skills as a artist, I experimented with Microsoft Word's drawing tools. They are surprisingly dynamic and I saw it as the best way I could make presentable art. It is relatively simple to use once you have enough experience knowing what all the tools can do and pushing them to their limits. The only issue is that it is time consuming when you are working with a piece that has a lot of layers. Some of the pieces I've made probably have at least 200 layers. It was worth the time for me because the result is something that looks much cleaner. I've tried using a tablet and never quite got comfortable to using one. It is a much different feel for me than drawing on paper or painting on a canvas. Drawing in Word is nothing like either of them because you are essentially moving the points of the shapes around to your liking. It feels more like you are making a model or putting together abstract shapes than actually drawing.</p>
<p>I'm just happy to be included in this project. The other artists on Smogon are so much more talented. It's just been fun to be able to extend my hobby to the internet!</p>
