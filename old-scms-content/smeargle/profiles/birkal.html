<h3>Who is Birkal?</h3>
<p>As one of Smogon's newest artists, I've contributed quite a bit already to projects like The Smog and The Create-A-Pokemon project. Although I only started contributing artwork to the site a few months ago, I have already drawn over fifty pieces for the latest two issues of The Smog. As one of the moderators of CAP, I also enjoy getting involved in the highly competitive art polls that take place every few months by handing out positive feedback and throwing my own hat into the ring. I'm also a piano performance major and I love to contribute compositional works and feedback to the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=87268">Smeargle's Studio Music Thread</a>. As side hobbies, I enjoy studying biology, rock climbing, and curling competitively.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Fatecrashers forced me into an art thread by using his Super Moderator powers; the unholy mess can be found <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3468178">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<p>I've drawn for the past two CAP projects and plan on doing even more in the future. I've also received a Smogon Artist Badge for my work with The Smog. Finally, I am one of the Site Staff members who helps upload artwork to Smogon's articles.</p>
