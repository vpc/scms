He has also written a few articles for the Smog, some being the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue22/starters">"About the Starters"</a> <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue23/starters">series of</a> <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue24/starters">articles</a> with sandshrewz. He is currently leading the huge <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3473261">BW2 in-game tier list</a> in Orange Islands. He has also done a lot of grammar work for the site, mainly for C&amp;C and The Smog.<br />
		<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Major gamer here. Spends most of his time playing various games; however, Pokémon is not the favorite videogame series.

He's a huge Nintendo fan in general, playing basically every series they release.<br/>
		<strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> He's not only Swedish, but also Spanish (Swedish mother / Spanish father); however, he can barely speak any Spanish. He's also, as far as he knows, the first Swede to get badged.<br />
