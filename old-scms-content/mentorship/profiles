		<strong>Content Areas:</strong><span class="areas"> Contributions &amp; Corrections, The Smog, Orange Islands, RarelyUsed</span><br />
		<strong>Well-known Contribution:</strong> He has completed over 50 analyses and is still working on more. He has also written a few articles for the Smog, some being the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue22/starters">"About the Starters"</a> <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue23/starters">series of</a> <a href="http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue24/starters">articles</a> with sandshrewz. He is currently leading the huge <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3473261">BW2 in-game tier list</a> in Orange Islands. He has also done a lot of grammar work for the site, mainly for C&amp;C and The Smog.<br />
		<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Major gamer here. Spends most of his time playing various games; however, Pokémon is not the favorite videogame series. That would be the The Legend of Zelda and the Super Smash Bros. series—Pokémon is tied second with Fire Emblem and (the Naughty Dog era) Crash Bandicoot series of games. He's a huge Nintendo fan in general, playing basically every series they release.<br/>
		<strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> He's not only Swedish, but also Spanish (Swedish mother / Spanish father); however, he can barely speak any Spanish. He's also, as far as he knows, the first Swede to get badged.<br />

<strong>Well-known Contribution:</strong> He's an official Team Rater, so that's that. He wrote the <a href="/bw/pokemon/tyranitar">Tyranitar revamp</a>, the old OU Krookodile analysis, and the <a href="/bw/articles/bw_volt_turn">VoltTurn Guide</a> with Harsha. <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3475053">Optical Overload</a> is a team he made that was accepted into the RMT archive, and that's one thing he is especially proud of. He hosts OU Research weeks with Novaray.<br />

In terms of music, he likes Jpop, Jrock, and EDM. His favorite groups / artists are UVERworld (Jrock), FLOW (Jrock), Pendulum (drum and bass), Daft Punk (French House), Justice (French House), and quite a few more that he doesn't exactly feel like listing out. He also thinks that video game OSTs are sorely underrated. He especially likes writing up RMTs, because he takes time to polish each of them off, and the end results end up looking amazing.<br />
<strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Harsha and Sayonara were his tutees and the people that encouraged him to pursue the Team Rater badge. His username actually was derived from a RMT posted a long time ago. <br /></p>
