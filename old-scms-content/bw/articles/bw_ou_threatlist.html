<h2>Offensive Threats</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/465.png" alt="Abomasnow" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Abomasnow"><strong>Abomasnow</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 90 HP / 92 Atk / 75 Def / 92 SpA / 85 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Snow Warning / Soundproof (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Abomasnow is unique in standard play as the only fully evolved Pokemon that can summon permanent hail. It is somewhat limited by its only decent offenses and mediocre Speed; therefore, it is often seen running a Choice Scarf set to make up for the latter, to take on the role of a revenge killer. It typically carries Blizzard and either Grass Knot or Wood Hammer, as well as Hidden Power Fire or Earthquake to deal with the Steel-types that resist its STABs. Abomasnow also makes for an annoying SubSeed user, as Leech Seed works in tandem with hail damage to slowly chip away at the opponent's health; it also has STAB Blizzard to severely punish any Grass-type that tries to nullify this strategy. The last move on this set is usually a choice between Focus Punch to smash Rock- and Steel-types, and Wood Hammer to demolish bulky Water-types.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/65.png" alt="Alakazam" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Alakazam"><strong>Alakazam</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 50 Atk / 45 Def / 135 SpA / 85 SpD / 120 Spe<br />
Abilities: Synchronize / Inner Focus / Magic Guard</p>

<p>Alakazam, having been denied OU status for numerous generations, was finally given it in part thanks to a new ability, Magic Guard. Now that it gained OU status, Alakazam is here to showcase its immense power. Packing base 135 Special Attack as well as base 120 Speed, and a move called Psyshock to hit the two blobs Chansey and Blissey, Alakazam is one tough cookie to break. It also runs plenty of sets; ranging from Sub + 3 Attacks to Offensive Calm Mind to All-Out Focus Sash sets, it will be difficult to predict what exactly Alakazam is doing. It is also hard to decide what item it could be holding due to Magic Guard making Alakazam take no recoil from Life Orb. Coverage wise, Alakazam strives for coverage with moves such as Focus Blast and Shadow Ball. However, some even run Hidden Power Fire, especially on the Focus Sash set to deal with one of Alakazam's biggest checks, Scizor. All in all, Alakazam is a Pokemon of immense power, and if you ever see one in battle, have a game plan for it, or else you'll be in trouble.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/184.png" alt="Azumarill" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Azumarill/ou"><strong>Azumarill</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 50 Atk / 80 Def / 50 SpA / 80 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Thick Fat / Huge Power / Sap Sipper</p>

<p>Although BW has not brought anything new for Azumarill, it still has a niche in the metagame. With the onslaught of many fast, powerful attackers and frail setup sweepers, powerful priority is virtually a must for any team, and Azumarill certainly provides this. With the combination of Huge Power and Choice Band, Azumarill can OHKO many of the top threats in the metagame with STAB Aqua Jet, as well as smack defensive threats such as Ferrothorn and Blissey with Superpower. The advent of Drizzle Politoed in OU makes it all the more difficult to deal with Azumarill, as few can stand up to a boosted Waterfall in rain. Azumarill also has coverage options, such as Ice Punch, to fall back on, and its great Water typing and above average defenses allow it to take the odd hit or two with ease. Overall, Azumarill is a great choice for any team lacking a solid revenge killer, and should always be played against carefully.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/286.png" alt="Breloom" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Breloom"><strong>Breloom</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 130 Atk / 80 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Abilities: Effect Spore / Poison Heal / Technician</p>

<p>A top tier threat in DPP OU, Breloom returns in BW largely unchanged. With access to Swords Dance, Poison Heal, a fantastic status move in Spore that eases setup, and two powerful STAB moves in Focus Punch and Seed Bomb, it is no wonder that Breloom remains such a dangerous threat. The BW sleep mechanics make Breloom all the more difficult to deal with, as Spore will now more often than not incapacitate a Pokemon for the rest of the match. This punching mushroom can run a number of effective sets, ranging from an all-out offensive set with Substitute, Spore, Focus Punch, and a coverage option, to a highly annoying SubSeed set. Aside from the abovementioned moves, Breloom also has coverage options, such as Stone Edge, and a useful priority move in Mach Punch to surprise unsuspecting opponents. Though Breloom sports a nasty 4x weakness to Flying-type moves, do not underestimate it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/251.png" alt="Celebi" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Celebi"><strong>Celebi</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Natural Cure</p>

<p>Celebi is a Pokemon that has always shined in the OU environment. It is easy to see why, as a typing that grants in 6 resistances, base 100 stats across the board, and a useful ability in Natural Cure, make Celebi a huge threat to look out for in OU. Also, thanks to its well-balanced stats, Celebi is a great team supporter and defensive pivot for offensive teams as it possesses great defensive qualities such as resisting Water-, Ground-, Fighting-, and Electric-type attacks that are common in OU, as well as sporting moves such as Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, Leech Seed, Recover, Dual Screens and Heal Bell. Sporting two great boosting attacks in Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, as well as coverage moves in Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire or Ice, offensive Celebi can rip through unprepared teams with ease. Celebi can also run choice sets, as it has Trick and U-turn, allowing it to cripple a potential check or keep up the momentum. Finally, to top of the great Pokemon which is Celebi, it can also use Baton Pass to pass along Substitutes, boosts from Nasty Plot, Calm Mind, or even Swords Dance, and with that great bulk, it's easy to see why Celebi has little difficulty doing that. However, it isn't all fun and games for the pixie. Since Celebi doesn't gain Psyshock, it can't get past Blissey or Chansey, two Pokemon which will give Celebi trouble. Celebi also sports a 4x weakness to Bug-type moves, meaning it can't handle Scizor without Hidden Power Fire. Speaking of Scizor, it can also trap Celebi with Pursuit due to Celebi's Psychic typing. Other Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Weavile can also trap Celebi. Lastly, Dragon-type Pokemon give Celebi without Hidden Power Ice, though Thunder Wave will keep them at bay. All in all, Celebi is a Pokemon with many uses in the OU metagame and is definitely a Pokemon to look out for.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/639.png" alt="Chandelure" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Chandelure/ou"><strong>Chandelure</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 55 Atk / 90 Def / 145 SpA / 90 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Abilities: Flash Fire / Flame Body / Shadow Tag (Unreleased)</p>

<p>One of the newest Ghost-types to grace the BW OU metagame, Chandelure has more than enough to set itself apart from its ghostly brethren. A gigantic base 145 Special Attack, two powerful STABs, and decent defensive stats make Chandelure a massive threat and a fantastic Choice Scarf user. Through Dream World, it is destined to gain the ability Shadow Tag: the reason for Wobbuffet's ban from standard play in previous Generations. Its movepool includes useful coverage options, such as Energy Ball, to deal with troublesome Water-types, as well as the boosting moves Calm Mind and Flame Charge. Access to useful support moves, such as Will-O-Wisp, means it is not bereft of support options either. Though Chandelure has a sub-par base 80 Speed, and sports weaknesses to Stealth Rock, as well as common Water-, Rock-, Dark-, Ghost-, and Ground-type attacks, do not underestimate Chandelure; one wrong step will spell doom for your chances of victory.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/91.png" alt="Cloyster" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Cloyster"><strong>Cloyster</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 95 Atk / 180 Def / 85 SpA / 45 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Abilities: Shell Armor / Skill Link / Overcoat (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Cloyster has traditionally relied on its massive Defense stat and solid support movepool , consisting of Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Rapid Spin, to snag it a place on teams in previous generations. However, it hit the jackpot in BW, gaining one of the the best boosting moves in the game: Shell Smash. This makes Cloyster a very dangerous mixed attacker, capable of tearing through entire teams without breaking a sweat. With just a single turn of setup, Cloyster's offensive stats skyrocket to massive heights, enabling it to OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame while still outspeeding many threats. Skill Link also gives Icicle Spear and Rock Blast maximum Base Power, meaning that not even Focus Sash, Substitute, Multiscale, or Sturdy can stop Cloyster's rampage. However, Shell Smash lowers Cloyster's defenses by one stage each. While Cloyster's Special Defense is awful as it is, Fighting-type priority users, such as Conkeldurr, can prey on Cloyster's lowered Defense and weakness to their attacks. Overall though, Cloyster is definitely a Pokemon to watch out for, as it can rip teams to shreds if not met with a check.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/562.png" alt="Conkeldurr" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Conkeldurr"><strong>Conkeldurr</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 105 HP / 140 Atk / 95 Def / 55 SpA / 65 SpD / 45 Spe<br />
Abilities: Guts / Sheer Force / Iron Fist (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Another slow, bulky, and very powerful Fighting type, Conkeldurr is not a clown to joke about. Conkeldurr packs a massive 140 base Attack, a great ability in Guts, and a fantastic boosting move in Bulk Up, making it one of the most potent threats in the metagame. Conkeldurr's good HP and Defense stats allow it to take the odd hit or two when setting up; STAB Drain Punch complements this well, significantly boosting its survivability. Powerful priority in Mach Punch also adds to its utility, letting it revenge kill threatening sweepers such as Cloyster. Its physical movepool isn't half bad either, it includes coverage options, such as Stone Edge and Payback, to complement its abovementioned STABs. However, its ability is what lets it stand out from the pack; Guts lets Conkeldurr scoff at the Achilles heel of many other physical attackers, enabling it to set up on walls that beat many of its fellow physical sweepers with status or Scald's burn chance. Aside from traditional Bulk Up and Choice Band sets, Conkeldurr can also abuse Guts directly with Flame Orb or Toxic Orb. Though common Psychic-types, such as Latios and Reuniclus, can dispose of Conkeldurr without too much trouble, dare not fool around with it, or its powerful fists will be the last thing you will ever see.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/584.png" alt="Darmanitan" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Darmanitan/ou"><strong>Darmanitan</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 105 HP / 140 Atk / 55 Def / 30 SpA / 55 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sheer Force / Zen Mode</p>

<p>With a colossal Attack stat, a devastating STAB move in Flare Blitz, and a great ability in Sheer Force, Darmanitan has the power to blast its way through its opponents, including those that resist its attacks. With a Sheer Force-boosted Flare Blitz under sun, Darmanitan can power its way through just about all Pokemon who aren't outright immune to Fire-type attacks. Those who are immune face the threat of a similarly boosted Rock Slide or Superpower, or a quick U-turn to a counter. Although Darmanitan excels at dealing large amounts of damage in short periods of time, its biggest fault is its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards, as well as recoil damage, which will ultimately be its downfall. Its poor defenses, and unfortunate base 95 Speed also mean that faster threats can revenge kill it easily. Nonetheless, Darmanitan is indeed a dangerous threat: underestimate its raw power at your own peril.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/196.png" alt="Espeon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Espeon"><strong>Espeon</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 65 Atk / 60 Def / 130 SpA / 95 SpD / 110 Spe<br />
Abilities: Synchronize / Magic Bounce</p>

<p>At first glance, Espeon appears to be outclassed by other Psychic-types, most notably Alakazam, who has higher Special Attack and Speed stats, as well as Focus Blast to beat Tyranitar. However, Espeon's saving grace comes not in the form of typing, stats, or moves, but in its Dream World ability: Magic Bounce. Its ability to deflect entry hazards, phazing moves, status moves, and Taunt not only gives it a niche on standard teams, but also allows it to set up on many defensive Pokemon, including Jellicent, Blissey without Seismic Toss, and Skarmory. Despite this incredible ability, Espeon's Psychic typing and poor Defense limit its ability to set up. Tyranitar and Scizor can come in and threaten Espeon with super effective STAB moves, forcing Espeon to switch or be KOed. Still, with the ability to pass Calm Mind boosts, reflect entry hazards, as well as set up and sweep itself, Espeon is an excellent support choice for any team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/94.png" alt="Gengar" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Gengar"><strong>Gengar</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 60 HP / 65 Atk / 60 Def / 130 SpA / 75 SpD / 110 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>With its Ghost typing, high base 110 Speed, and massive base 130 Special Attack, Gengar remains a dangerous threat four generations after its introduction. Convenient immunities to common Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks make Gengar a great pivot, giving it a wealth of opportunities to switch in and wreak havoc. Along with a powerful STAB Shadow Ball, Gengar has fantastic coverage options in Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, Energy Ball, and Hidden Power . As Shadow Ball and Focus Blast achieve perfect neutral coverage together, Gengar can simultaneously make use of its multitude of support options, including Substitute, Disable, and Pain Split, making it an effective check to threats such as Conkeldurr, and even walls such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Jellicent. Despite these amazing perks, the fact remains that Gengar has poor defensive stats, and can be revenge killed by faster threats, such as Alakazam and Starmie, as well as by priority, unless it is safely tucked away behind a Substitute. Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, wreck Gengar too, and have the bulk to take a Focus Blast most of the time. Still, tread carefully, else Gengar will be truly frightening to deal with.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/477.png" alt="Gliscor" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Gliscor"><strong>Gliscor</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 95 Atk / 125 Def / 45 SpA / 75 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hyper Cutter / Sand Veil / Poison Heal</p>

<p>Despite being thought of as a primarily defensive threat, Gliscor's stats, movepool, and typing lend themselves to effective offensive sets as well. With its bulk and decent Speed, it is easily able to switch into top threats, such as Tyranitar and Lucario, and threaten them with its STAB Earthquake. It can then use Swords Dance to boost its Attack as the opponent switches out, activating its Poison Heal ability at the same time. Such a setup allows Gliscor to protect itself from status, gradually restore its health, and threaten the opposing team at the same time. Gliscor will typically supplement its powerful boosted STAB Earthquake with some combination of Stone Edge, Taunt, and Ice Fang. A lesser-seen alternative is Flying Gem, which enables Gliscor to effectively use a full-powered Acrobatics alongside Earthquake and, in doing so, score super effective hits on 8 of the 17 types with its boosted STAB attacks alone. In this metagame, a check to offensive Gliscor is mandatory for any successful team, as any unprepared team will quickly be decimated by it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/368.png" alt="Gorebyss" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Gorebyss/ou"><strong>Gorebyss</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 55 HP / 84 Atk / 105 Def / 114 SpA / 75 SpD / 52 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Hydration</p>

<p>Since its appearance, Gorebyss has consistently wallowed in the depths of NU. This generation, however, it received one of the best boosting moves, Shell Smash, enabling Gorebyss to sweep despite its otherwise average stats. However, sweeping isn't the most dangerous thing Gorebyss can do: it, Huntail, and Smeargle are the only Pokemon that can Baton Pass said Shell Smash boosts. This turns Gorebyss into an unparalleled support Pokemon that, in a single turn, can set up a sweep for one of its more dangerous teammates, such as Haxorus, Nidoking, and mixed Jirachi. Gorebyss does have some problems: its defenses are average at best,which makes it difficult to find setup opportunities, and Prankster users can prevent it from passing its boosts. To solve the first problem, Gorebyss is almost always paired with dual screens Deoxys-S, which means it'll survive all but the most powerful hits; White Herb also serves to nullify the drop to its defenses. The second is easier to fix: since all Prankster users are weak to Ice Beam, Gorebyss can OHKO them while they Taunt, and attempt to Baton Pass later. All in all, if Gorebyss can successfully pass Shell Smash, you will certainly be in huge trouble.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/642.png" alt="Haxorus" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Haxorus"><strong>Haxorus</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 76 HP / 147 Atk / 90 Def / 60 SpA / 70 SpD / 97 Spe<br />
Abilities: Rivalry / Mold Breaker / Unnerve (Unreleased) </p>

<p>Haxorus was a vastly overhyped threat in the early stages of BW, and is not quite the terror that its massive base 147 Attack might make it seem. However, it is still a very dangerous threat. Outside of its powerful STAB Outrage, Haxorus has coverage options in Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Brick Break, allowing it to surprise unsuspecting opponents which switch in expecting Outrage. Access to boosting moves, such as Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, makes Haxorus a dangerous setup sweeper too, as it can be hard to stop after just a single turn of setup. It is also one of the few Dragon-types with access to Taunt, which means that phazing walls, such as Skarmory, won't be stopping Haxorus in a hurry. It can also utilize Choice Band to smash its way through teams with just the raw power of its STAB Outrage, which can power through even the likes of Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory! Choice Scarf Haxorus also happens to be one of the only reliable checks to Dragon Dance Dragonite in the metagame. What does keep our axe-faced dragon from being a top-tier threat, however, is its odd base 97 Speed, which means it is outsped by a huge number of threats who can exploit its average defenses and weakness to common Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Still, be sure to pack a Steel-type or two, or Haxorus will be a massive pain for your team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/490.png" alt="Heatran" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Heatran"><strong>Heatran</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 91 HP / 90 Atk / 106 Def / 130 SpA / 106 SpD / 77 Spe<br />
Abilities: Flash Fire / Flame Body (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Heatran is a very versatile Pokemon that can run a variety of sets, ranging from all-out offensive ones to defensive ones. With great balanced stats, a unique and effective typing, as well as a useful ability in Flash Fire, Heatran can run a fantastic offensive set , which, when backed by a Life Orb or a Choice Specs, has the power to rip through whole teams. Slapping a Choice Scarf on Heatran makes it a great revenge killer too, as it can then outspeed many popular unboosted sweepers, while simultaneously being able to finish off most threats with a powerful STAB Fire Blast. It also has the ability to clean up weakened teams late-game with any its offensive set. Finally, Heatran has a variety of support options, and its respectable defenses allow it to sponge most neutral and resisted attacks. With a great support movepool including Stealth Rock, Sunny Day, Roar, Taunt, Toxic, Protect, and Torment, the only thing that stops Heatran from being a top mixed wall is its lack of reliable recovery, which nonetheless can be somewhat remedied by Leftovers. Despite having a nasty weakness to common Ground-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks, Heatran is still quite a threat, and makes a great addition to any team looking for a bulky, powerful attacker.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/665.png" alt="Hydreigon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Hydreigon"><strong>Hydreigon</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 92 HP / 105 Atk / 90 Def / 125 SpA / 90 Def / 98 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>A high base 125 Special Attack, a unique typing, and decent defensive stats, along with a massive movepool and a wonderful ability in Levitate, give this new dragon a niche in the metagame, making it a very dangerous threat indeed. Hydreigon's wide movepool, which includes Fire Blast, Surf, Dark Pulse, Draco Meteor, and Focus Blast, allows it to check a large range of threats. Levitate and its decent defenses also give Hydreigon the ability to switch in with ease and take the odd hit or two. Hydreigon can also surprise its normal would-be counters by running physical moves ,such as Earthquake and Outrage, thanks to its good base 105 Attack. Unfortunately, Hydreigon's odd base 98 Speed leaves it outpaced by a large number of threats who can hit it hard with their STAB attacks, Dragon-types in particular. While Hydreigon's defenses are decent, they are not spectacular, and it can't stomach powerful attacks from the likes of Conkeldurr and Latios. Its Dark part-typing also bestows on it unfortunate weaknesses to common Fighting- and Bug-type attacks. Offensively, special walls such as Blissey wall Hydreigon unless it runs Outrage. Still, Hydreigon is a dangerous threat that, thanks to its sheer offensive power and wide movepool, can raze unprepared teams easily if given the chance.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/395.png" alt="Infernape" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Infernape"><strong>Infernape</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 76 HP / 104 Atk / 71 Def / 104 SpA / 71 Def / 108 Spe<br />
Abilities: Blaze / Iron Fist</p>

<p>Although Infernape received a massive amount of competition from all the new Fighting-types introduced in Black and White, do not make the mistake of overlooking it, for it is as great a threat as ever. Sporting great balanced offensive stats and a high base 108 Speed, Infernape can function effectively as a wonderful mixed attacker. Infernape also has adiverse movepool to back it up, with its powerful physical and special STAB moves, complemented by good coverage options in Earthquake, Stone Edge, Grass Knot, ThunderPunch, U-turn, and Hidden Power, and priority in the form of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. This allows it to deal with threats ranging from the ubiquitous Blissey and Ferrothorn to even the likes of Jirachi and Tyranitar. Access to boosting moves, such as Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, and Work Up, also makes Infernape one of the most dangerous set-up sweepers around. Unfortunately, our flaming ape has its fair share of problems. Although it is not by any means slow, offensive threats such as Latios and Gengar outspeed it; this is compounded by the fact that Infernape has poor defensive stats. Despite these flaws, Infernape is easily a top-tier threat that can run away with the game if you are not careful.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/385.png" alt="Jirachi" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Jirachi"><strong>Jirachi</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Serene Grace</p>

<p>It's not a stretch to say that Jirachi is one of the most versatile and useful Pokemon in the BW OU metagame. With a number of classic and new threats thriving in OU, including but not limited to Ferrothorn, Latios, Latias, Reuniclus, and Tyranitar, Jirachi's well-rounded combination of offense and defense is sorely needed on many teams. Jirachi has many things going for it: in addition to its Steel / Psychic typing, which grants Jirachi a whopping eight resistances and only two weaknesses, it is also gifted with the amazing ability, Serene Grace, along with many options with which to abuse it. Jirachi is quite the force to be reckoned with, as its versatility allows it to play physically or specially, and each set has different checks from the others. On the special side, Jirachi can utilize Calm Mind to lure in and eliminate a number of physically defensive threats with ease. Physically, too, Jirachi poses a massive threat with the notorious Iron Head, which, thanks to Serene Grace, has a massive 60% flinch chance, complemented with coverage options in the elemental Punches to check the likes of Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor. More often than not, Jirachi requires minimal support to function, as its wonderful bulk and typing allow it to set up easily on various types of teams. Once its counters and checks have been eliminated, Jirachi can break through most teams in a metagame heavily reliant on defensive Pokemon&mdash;still with that ever-serene smile on its face.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/230.png" alt="Kingdra" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Kingdra/ou"><strong>Kingdra</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:75 HP / 95 Atk / 95 Def / 95 SpA / 95 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swift Swim / Sniper / Damp (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Kingdra often faces huge competition from its Dragon-typed brethren for a team slot. While its stats seem merely mediocre, Kingdra does have a number of traits that allow it to destroy various types of teams in OU. One thing that sets it apart is its unique Water / Dragon typing; with resistances to three common attacking types, only one weakness to Dragon-type moves, and decent defensive stats, Kingdra can set up easily on a regular basis. This typing also grants Kingdra good offensive dual STAB coverage, resisted only by the common Ferrothorn, as well as the less popular Empoleon and Shedinja. Kingdra may also threaten teams in numerous ways. While Dragon Dance can be used on many builds of Kingdra, Rain Dance sets also have the power to immediately break through teams, especially popular weather-oriented ones. In rain, Kingdra can take advantage of its ability, Swift Swim, to outrun just about the whole metagame, making it especially difficult to revenge kill. You may be very tempted to pair Kingdra with a Drizzle Politoed; however, the combination of Swift Swim and Drizzle is banned, so Kingdra will have to resort to the classic methods it used last generation. Nonetheless, this doesn't stop it from being a significant offensive threat.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/676.png" alt="Kyurem" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Kyurem/ou"><strong>Kyurem</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:125 HP / 130 Atk / 90 Def / 130 SpA / 90 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Ability: Pressure</p>

<p>At first glance, Kyurem appears to be a very mighty attacker , capable of tearing through even the bulkiest of walls. Excellent base stats, along with high-powered mixed dual STAB attacks in Outrage, Draco Meteor, and Blizzard also back up this claim. However, Kyurem is almost completely let down by an average base 95 Speed, a small movepool with no boosting moves outside of Hone Claws, and a defensively atrocious Dragon / Ice typing, which gives it weaknesses to common Fighting- and Steel-type priority attacks, in addition to a Stealth Rock weakness. As rarely seen as it is, Kyurem is not to be underestimated. Kyurem achieves perfect neutral coverage with just Focus Blast and its STAB attacks, and this, in conjunction with its equally outstanding offenses, allow it to function as an effective mixed stallbreaker. With excellent 125 / 90 / 90 defenses, Kyurem is certainly durable enough to take the odd neutral hit or two, allowing it to hang around for a while. Despite having several crippling disadvantages, Kyurem should not be taken lightly, and is an offensive threat which every team should be prepared to deal with, especially in hailing conditions.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/380.png" alt="Latias" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Latias"><strong>Latias</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:80 HP / 80 Atk / 90 Def / 110 SpA / 130 SpD / 110 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>The transition to BW has seen Latias once again allowed into standard play, with the sole stipulation that it may not hold its signature item, the banned Soul Dew. Nonetheless, Latias is capable of putting its high Speed, power, access to instant recovery, and formidable bulk to good use. While certain offensive sets are viable, it is generally outclassed offensively by its brother Latios, and as such finds itself using sets that take advantage of its higher bulk. These include the mono-attacking Calm Mind set, dual screen sets that utilize Wish, and various other incarnations of the aforementioned Calm Mind set. By running these sets, Latias functions as an excellent answer to various sweepers, such as Heatran and Jolteon, and is a first-rate switch-in to specially based weather inducers Ninetales and Politoed, easily healing off any damage with Recover. With the metagame centered largely around Fighting- and Dragon-type threats, both of which Latias handles well thanks to its resistance to the former and ability to outspeed and KO nearly all of the latter, it fits very nicely into the metagame.</p>

<a href="/bw/pokemon/Latios"><strong>Latios</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:80 HP / 90 Atk / 80 Def / 130 SpA / 110 SpD / 110 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>It's no mystery as to why Latios is one of the most feared Pokemon out there: with its massive base 130 Special Attack and base 110 Speed stats, as well as passable bulk, Latios is one of the most effective attackers in the metagame. Draco Meteor, perhaps its most common attack, has enough power to heavily dent even the likes of Ferrothorn, and the ability to take Latios's Choice Specs Draco Meteor has become the standard by which all special walls in OU are judged. Latios is able to run a variety of sets ranging from Choice Specs to Calm Mind to even Dragon Dance. However, it's not all sunshine for Latios, as its secondary typing, Psychic, cripples it in many ways. Scizor in particular can utilize its resistance to Draco Meteor to come in almost unscathed and trap Latios with Pursuit; specially defensive Tyranitar also works magnificently in this role. Overall, Latios is a massive offensive threat, but like all others, it is not without its weaknesses.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/467.png" alt="Magnezone" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Magnezone"><strong>Magnezone</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:70 HP / 70 Atk / 115 Def / 130 SpA / 95 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Magnet Pull / Sturdy / Analytic</p>

<p>With the abundance of Steel-type defensive walls in the metagame, it is no wonder that Magnezone is such a common threat. Magnet Pull gives Magnezone the ability to trap virtually any pesky Steel-type, and either promptly KO it with its powerful STAB attacks, or set up on it with Charge Beam thanks to its wonderful physical bulk. Even though Magnezone doesn't have the largest movepool, Hidden Power Fire and its STAB moves give it all the coverage it needs; its huge base 130 Special Attack also makes up for its lack of coverage options. Magnezone can also deal with the common Ferrothorn + Jellicent defensive core, making it a great choice for just about any team that needs the removal of walls—Steel-types in particular—for a teammate to sweep. Ironically, Magnezone itself is also a Steel-type, meaning it suffers from the same flaws that its Steel-type brethren have to contend with. A painful 4x weakness to common Ground-type attacks is probably the most exploitable. Magnezone is also slow, meaning that speedy Pokemon with Fighting- and Fire-type attacks can KO it with ease. Despite these flaws, Magnezone can make unprepared teams pay, since it can remove entire defensive cores without so much as blinking an eye.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/151.png" alt="Mew" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Mew/ou"><strong>Mew</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Synchronize</p>

<p>Mew is one of the growing number of legendary pixie Pokemon with base 100 stats across the board; however, what sets it apart is its access to every TM and non-exclusive tutor move in the game, making Mew unparalleled in its versatility. It can run a great number of sets, all of which capitalize on its fantastic defensive, offensive, and supportive capabilities. Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, Calm Mind, and Amnesia are literally the tip of the iceberg when it comes to boosting moves that can be Baton Passed to more dangerous threats. With its great Special Attack and Speed, however, it can just as easily sweep on its own with Nasty Plot, utilizing STAB Psyshock to take down even special walls, such as Blissey and Jellicent. It can also run a more defensive Calm Mind set which still packs quite a punch; this places more emphasis on its bulk and access to an instant recovery moves, such as Roost, Recover, and Softboiled. Additionally, a stallbreaker set sporting Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Recover can beget great results if given the proper support. Overall, be very wary of Mew, as behind its pink pixie exterior lies immense versatility and power.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/650.png" alt="Mienshao" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Mienshao/ou"><strong>Mienshao</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:65 HP / 125 Atk / 60 Def / 95 SpA / 60 SpD / 105 Spe<br />
Abilities: Inner Focus / Regenerator / Reckless</p>

<p>One of the many new Fighting-types introduced in BW, Mienshao stands out of the pack in several unique ways. First, it is one of the fastest Fighting-types in the game with base 105 Speed; this enables it to outrun the many Pokemon sitting at the base 100 Speed benchmark. Its offenses—a high 125 base Attack and a usable base 95 Special Attack—aren't bad either, and give it a fair amount of versatility. Though its movepool is relatively shallow, it nonetheless contains lots of useful moves such as U-turn, Hi Jump Kick, Fake Out, Calm Mind, Swords Dance, Work Up, Hidden Power Ice, and even Grass Knot. Access to Regenerator is the icing on the cake, as with it, Mienshao need not worry about residual damage from Life Orb, sandstorm, entry hazards, and status, as well as recoil from Hi Jump Kick, enhancing its longevity by leaps and bounds. However, Mienshao is frail and can't take too many hits, and also struggles greatly against Ghost-types due to a lack of any decent Dark- or Ghost-type moves. Even with these flaws, Mienshao is still a solid Pokemon to use, and even with its small movepool, it can run surprisingly diverse sets.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/34.png" alt="Nidoking" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Nidoking/ou"><strong>Nidoking</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:81 HP / 92 Atk / 77 Def / 85 SpA / 75 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Poison Point / Rivalry / Sheer Force</p>

<p>Overlooked in past generations due to its middling stats, Nidoking received a blessing in the form of its Dream World ability, Sheer Force. This allows Nidoking to make full use of its fantastic movepool with a very efficient Life Orb set. Nidoking's useful typing protects it from paralysis and poison, and also allows it to remove Toxic Spikes upon switching in. It has access to powerful STAB moves, such as Earth Power and Sludge Wave, as well as the elemental trio of Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam, all which gain a Sheer Force boost. If you find the number of Sheer Force-boosted physical moves disappointing, Nidoking also received a way to boost its decent Attack and raise its Accuracy with Hone Claws, making moves such as Stone Edge, Fire Blast, Thunder, and Blizzard feasible on a mixed set. Though middling Speed and so-so defenses may hold Nidoking back, its ability to counter even the threatening Conkledurr speaks volumes of Nidoking's newfound power.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/186.png" alt="Politoed" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Politoed"><strong>Politoed</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:90 HP / 75 Atk / 75 Def / 90 SpA / 100 SpD / 70 Spd<br />
Abilities: Water Absorb / Damp / Drizzle</p>

<p>Outclassed by other Water-types in previous generations, Politoed shot to instant stardom with the arrival of Gen V: Politoed received Drizzle from the Dream World, turning the OU metagame on its head. In fact, Politoed's infinite rain provided such an exceptional boost to Swift Swim that the two were banned together on the same team. Although perhaps its best abusers are gone, Politoed's rain still contributes to rain stall teams and teams that need other weathers removed. Politoed itself functions well both as a bulky Water-type and a Choice Scarf user, as its reasonable bulk and moderate Speed allow it to revenge kill many sweepers, particularly those that depend on another weather, mainly Chlorophyll sweepers, as well as threats such as non-Choice Scarf Jirachi. Politoed isn't perfect, though, as its low Defense and Speed make it easy to wear down. Ferrothorn and Jellicent make excellent counters too, as neither takes much damage from any of Politoed's attacks, and can cripple it with a status move. Despite these flaws, Politoed is an excellent choice to base a weather team around or to check opposing weather.</p>

<a href="/bw/pokemon/Rotom-W"><strong>Rotom-W</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:50 HP / 65 Atk / 107 Def / 105 SpA / 107 SpD / 86 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>With only one weakness thanks to its ability , Levitate, as well as two great offensive STABs, Rotom-W makes a great tank in today's metagame. This, in conjunction with good bulk and a solid Special Attack stat, allows Rotom-W to both take hits and dish out damage equally well. STAB Thunderbolt, Volt Switch, and Hydro Pump hit hard when backed by Choice Specs, enabling Rotom-W to counter the rain and sand teams so common in the current metagame. This affable washing machine also has Hidden Power to surprise walls that resist its STAB moves, such as Ferrothorn and Gastrodon, thus providing great coverage. Its low base HP further allows Rotom-W to make good use of its semi-reliable recovery move in Pain Split; that this hurts walls such as Blissey at the same time is a bonus. Though Rotom-W is not a game-breaking offensive force, its ability to both take hits and retaliate is what makes it a Pokemon to look out for. </p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/373.png" alt="Salamence" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Salamence"><strong>Salamence</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:95 HP / 135 Atk / 80 Def / 110 SpA / 80 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Abilities: Intimidate / Moxie</p>

<p>This controversial DPP Uber continues to be a major threat in the BW OU metagame. Its high offenses are a major reason for this: base 135 Attack and base 110 Special Attack are nothing to scoff at, even with the power creep this Generation. Dragon Dance allows it to run roughshod over entire teams with just a single turn of setup; what's more, Salamence's large movepool and two abilities makes it unpredictable, as it works equally well as a mixed wallbreaker, a fast Choice Scarf user, and as a bulky phazer with Wish and Dragon Tail. However, Salamence's throne as the best Dragon-type in OU has become much less secure. Latias and Latios dropped down from Ubers this generation; both which outspeed Salamence and can easily OHKO it with their STAB Dragon-type attacks. Dragonite gained a valuable asset in Multi Scale, while Haxorus boasts a higher base Attack stat. Still, there are few true counters to Salamence, making it a great choice as a physical or mixed sweeper on a team in need of its services. Even walls such as Ferrothorn only check it at best, and only the very rare Cresselia counters it fully. Despite the introduction of other powerful Dragon-types, and new threats looking to usurp its throne, Salamence is still a very solid threat and should never be overlooked when building a team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/616.png" alt="Sawsbuck" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Sawsbuck/ou"><strong>Sawsbuck</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:80 HP / 100 Atk / 70 Def / 60 SpA / 70 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Chlorophyll / Sap Sipper / Serene Grace</p>

<p>Though a rarer sight than the omnipresent Venusaur as a Chlorophyll sweeper, Sawsbuck is nonetheless a deadly offensive threat with its dangerous Swords Dance set. With its unique dual STAB, and Jump Kick or Nature Power (Earthquake in WiFi battles) for coverage, Sawsbuck can hit a wide range of threats very hard. If given the opportunity to set up, it can easily sweep entire teams that lack the Fighting-type priority it hates. A little less threatening is the four attacks set, which is an excellent revenge killer available to sun teams, as it outspeeds almost the entire metagame, while still being able to switch moves. It should be noted, however, that this set lacks the power to carry out a clean sweep, and is therefore generally less of a threat. Megahorn will typically be used in the fourth slot in order to revenge kill Latios and Latias, as well as to hit opposing Grass-types harder, making Sawsbuck very hard to stop.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/212.png" alt="Scizor" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Scizor"><strong>Scizor</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:70 HP / 130 Atk / 100 Def / 55 SpA / 80 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Abilities: Swarm / Technician / Light Metal (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Despite the arrival of many new threats in BW, Scizor continues to be a powerhouse and is a staple on many teams. Its standard set in DPP, the Choice Band set is still seen everywhere, while the Swords Dance set is no less effective. Both pack quite the punch, and can blow holes in the opposing team regardless of the situation: U-turn coming off of Scizor's base 130 Attack deals plenty of damage, and also allows Scizor to be an effective scout and pivot. With Swords Dance and a Life Orb, there isn't much that can handle Scizor's STAB- and Technician-boosted priority Bullet Punch. However, as with all Pokemon, the metal bug has its drawbacks. The newly introduced Chandelure resists all of Scizor's common moves barring Pursuit, and can easily dispose of Scizor with its STAB Fire-type attacks. Volcarona is also an excellent Scizor slayer, sporting STAB Fire-type moves, a resistance to most of Scizor's moves, and Flame Body to burn Scizor when it attacks. Although itmust push on in light of these new threats, Scizor is still a powerful threat in the OU metagame, and will likely remain a staple for generations to come.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/590.png" alt="Scrafty" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Scrafty/ou"><strong>Scrafty</strong></a><br />
Base Stats:65 HP / 90 Atk / 115 Def / 45 SpA / 115 SpD / 58 Spe<br />
Abilities: Shed Skin / Moxie / Intimidate (Unreleased)</p>

<p>With wonderful defensive stats, a decent base 90 Attack, and access to fantastic boosting moves in Bulk Up and Dragon Dance, Scrafty makes an excellent setup sweeper. Its STABs achieve near-perfect neutral coverage, allowing Scrafty to score many KOs with just these two moves. Scrafty also has two wonderful abilities in Shed Skin and Moxie. The former not only protects it from status, but also allows it to abuse Rest effectively, giving it a form of recovery to go along with Drain Punch, and allowing it many more boosts. The latter, on the other hand, makes it more difficult to stop each time it scores a KO, and can be devastating in conjunction with Speed boosts from Dragon Dance. Scrafty's offensive movepool also includes options such as Ice Punch to hit switch-ins, such as Gliscor, hard, and Dragon Tail can be used to phaze boosting opponents and rack up residual damage. It also has support options such as Taunt and Counter to stop opposing set-up sweepers and surprise physical attackers respectively. Unfortunately, Scrafty is let down by its poor base 58 Speed and Fighting-type weakness, which allows faster Fighting-types, such as Infernape, to outspeed and pummel Scrafty with STAB Fighting-type attacks. Trick also shuts down Scrafty, forcing it to switch or become locked thanks to a Choice item. Still, Scrafty can break open the game in a matter of a few turns, and is a threat which every team should be prepared for.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/121.png" alt="Starmie" /><br />

Base Stats:60 HP / 75 Atk / 85 Def / 100 SpA / 85 SpD / 115 Spe<br />
Abilities: Illuminate / Natural Cure / Analytic</p>

<p>This long-time OU veteran of all four previous generations has a tried-and-tested combination of blistering Speed, fantastic Special Attack, great coverage, and devastating high-powered moves. With Hydro Pump, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam in its arsenal, Starmie can rip apart unprepared teams easily with a Life Orb set, with Recover making it much more difficult to take down than its mediocre defenses may suggest. Starmie is also blessed with the fairly exclusive Rapid Spin and the useful Natural Cure to thwart the efforts of opposing defensive teams. Although Starmie is equipped with the perfect tools for a special sweeper, it is sorely let down by its lack of a boosting move, and it is also walled by common rain counters, such as Ferrothorn and Gastrodon, as well as classic special walls, such as Blissey and Chansey. Just be sure to carry a check to Starmie, or it will sweep unhindered.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/669.png" alt="Terrakion" /><br />

Base Stats:91 HP / 129 Atk / 90 Def / 72 SpA / 90 SpD / 108 Spe<br />
Ability: Justified</p>

<p>Terrakion's good bulk, incredible base 129 Attack, base 108 Speed , which even unboosted, outpaces a significant proportion of the metagame, and access to both Swords Dance and Rock Polish, make it a fantastic setup sweeper. Its STAB moves are resisted only by a handful of uncommon Pokemon, such as Claydol, Toxicroak, and Golurk, enabling it to run a double-boosting set with both Rock Polish and Swords Dance to tailor its boostsdepending on the team it is facing. Terrakion also functions brilliantly with Choice sets with its high Attack and Speed, which makes it a versatile threat. Its ability, Justified, further allows it to snatch an Attack boost by switching in on Dark-type moves, such as Tyranitar's Crunch or Pursuit. Though Terrakion sports weaknesses to common Ground-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks, and is outsped by common threats, such as Starmie, the Lati siblings, and Gengar, underestimate it at your own peril.</p>

Base Stats:79 HP / 115 Atk / 70 Def / 125 SpA / 80 SpD / 111 Spe<br />
Abilities: Prankster / Defiant</p>

<p>Tornadus is one of the most threatening sweepers on rain teams. The one trait that really separates it from other rain-oriented Pokemon is its powerful Flying-type STAB, Hurricane, which rivals Latios' Draco Meteor in power and comes without any drawback in rain. This alone allows Tornadus to run an extremely threatening Choice Specs set, which generally only Tyranitar, as well as defensive Steel- and Electric-types, such as Jirachi andRotom-W, can check reliably, and even then, the 30% probability of confusion may prove problematic. Tornadus can also run an effective mixed set, a Bulk Up set, or even a Rain Dance support set to bypass the Drizzle + Swift Swim combination ban. However, a vulnerability to priority moves, as well as an overreliance on rain, let Tornadus down, as it is effectively neutered once its weather is removed. Still, Tornadus makes a great addition to any rain team, and should always be handled carefully.</p>

Base Stats:83 HP / 106 Atk / 65 Def / 86 SpA / 65 SpD / 85 Spe<br />
Abilities: Anticipation / Dry Skin / Poison Touch (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Toxicroak has always been an odd Pokemon. With middling stats all across the board, it may, at first glance, seem like nothing more than a mediocre Pokemon. However, Toxicroak's viability in OU lies in its highly coveted ability, Dry Skin, which restores 12.5% of its health in rain, and recovers health when hit by Water-type attacks. This, along with Toxicroak’s Poison typing, allows it to completely wall nearly every bulky Water-type and set up in their faces. Toxicroak also has an interestingly wide physical and special movepool, as well as access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, to increase its clout as a setup sweeper significantly. Its large movepool includes useful priority options, such as Fake Out and Sucker Punch, and gives it great coverage. It goes without saying that Toxicroak is a great fit on rain teams, as it can deal with Ferrothorn, a huge pain for any rain team. Overall, Toxicroak is an extremely underrated threat that should not be taken lightly.</p>

Base Stats:100 HP / 134 Atk / 110 Def / 95 SpA / 100 SpD / 61 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sand Stream / Unnerve</p>

<p>The mighty sand tyrant returns to take the BW OU metagame by storm&mdash;and for good reason too. Tyranitar sports many impressive traits , such as fantastically balanced stats overall, great typing that grants it excellent dual STAB, a surprisingly diverse movepool, and of course, Sand Stream. With fantastic Attack and access to boosting moves, such as Curse and Dragon Dance, as well as the ability to make good use of Choice Band or Choice Scarf, Tyranitar can effectively run a large variety of sets. It can also serve as a lure, surprising common switch-ins with excellent special moves, such as Fire Blast and Ice Beam, or assist its team with support moves, such as Roar, Dragon Tail, Stealth Rock, Taunt, and even Thunder Wave. Probably the main reason to use Tyranitar, though, is that its everlasting sandstorm greatly powers up Pokemon,including Landorus and Terrakion. However, Tyranitar packs many weakness to common types, such as Ground, Water, Bug, Steel, and most especially Fighting, has a somewhat underwhelming Speed stat, and also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome: it can do a lot, but not everything at once. Due to Tyranitar's popularity, there also exist many threats that easily stop Tyranitar's fun: Drizzle Politoed; various Fighting-types—both old and new—such as Conkeldurr, and Infernape; bulky Water-types; Scizor; and ironically opposing Landorus and Terrakion. Even with these setbacks, this tyrant is still a solid threat to be overlooked at your own peril.</p>

Abilities: Overgrow / Chlorophyll</p>

<p>You will probably be most familiar with this overgrown plant monster as the undisputed king of DPP UU. Do not be fooled by its failure to achieve OU glory, however, for Venusaur received a massive boost in the generation shift, vastly increasing its sweeping potential. First and foremost, it received the ability Chlorophyll through the Dream World; this combines perfectly with the buff to Growth in sun to transform Venusaur into an unstoppable monster with just one turn of setup. It is the premier Chlorophyll sweeper due to its large movepool, but there are generally only two variants of Venusaur one needs to prepare for. The specially based set works off Venusaur's higher offensive stat, but access to powerful physical moves such as Return and Earthquake, also allows Venusaur to run an effective mixed set that easily lures in and destroys its usual counters. Venusaur also has the options of Synthesis for recovery and Sleep Powder to buy it a free turn of setup, compensating somewhat for its underwhelming defenses, though it should be noted that Venusaur may not always be able to spare the necessary moveslots. Finally, Chlorophyll is incompatible with Venusaur's egg moves, most notably Power Whip; nonetheless, Venusaur on a dedicated sun team is a threat one should definitely be prepared for.</p>

Ability: Victory Star</p>

<p>The newest addition to the pool of pixie-like Pokemon with 600 BST, Victini possesses a unique Psychic / Fire typing that is both a blessing and a curse. Its Psychic typing grants it a rather annoying Pursuit weakness, and its Fire typing confers on it a Stealth Rock weakness. However, do not be put off by Victini's poor defensive typing. Its stat spread makes it extremely bulky all around even without investment. Victini's movepool is likewise impressive on both the physical and special sides, and it furthermore enjoys access to a multitude of signature moves, including Fusion Bolt, Fusion Flare, and Searing Shot, of course, the 180 base power V-create. Victini also gets powerful coverage moves, including Focus Blast, Shadow Ball, Energy Ball, Brick Break, and even Thunder, as well as the support moves Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Trick Room. Perhaps Victini's most devastating set is its Choice Band set, as a sun-boosted V-create decimates all but Flash Fire Pokemon. Victini can also run an effective Choice Scarf set to revenge kill faster threats. Lastly, Victini is one of the select few Pokemon to receive the move Final Gambit, which finds great utility thanks to Victini's large base HP. Underestimate this cute little Pokemon mascot at your peril.</p>

Base Stats:91 HP / 90 Atk / 72 Def / 90 SpA / 129 SpD / 108 Spe<br />
Ability: Justified</p>

<p>Being a member of the newest musketeer trio, Virizion certainly packs quite a punch. Although its Attack and Special Attack stats appear underwhelming for a supposed offensive threat, Virizion can boost these effectively with Swords Dance, Calm Mind, and Work Up, giving it a fair amount of versatility. However, what sets Virizion apart from its many Fighting-type counterparts is its fantastic base 129 Special Defense and wonderful Grass / Fighting typing, which makes it an excellent check to sand and rain teams alike. STAB Grass moves are particularly useful, as they let Virizion break through Unaware Quagsire, a full stop to many other Fighting-types. Virizion is no slow customer either, as it boasts one of the highest base Speeds of all Fighting-types. Though Virizion has a small movepool with only Hidden Power and Stone Edge to rely upon outside of its STAB attacks, it still gets the job done very well. Access to Taunt also allows it to check slower setup sweepers, and boost up against walls with ease, strengthening its clout as a top-tier threat. However, Virizion's poor base 72 Defense prevents it from taking powerful physical attacks, despite useful resistances such as to the EdgeQuake and VoltTurn combo. Base 108 Speed, while fast, leaves Virizion outsped by Pokemon such as Latios and Tornadus. Opposing Calm Mind users with Psyshock, such as Latias and Reuniclus, can set up alongside it and ultimately come out victorious. Virizion's typing also grants it weaknesses to common Fire- and Ice-type attacks in addition to a nasty 4x Flying-type weakness. Still, Virizion is a dangerous threat that can make unprepared teams pay heavily.</p>

Abilities: Flame Body / Swarm (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Volcarona was perhaps one of the most underhyped threats of the new metagame. However, people quickly realized that with just one turn of set up, this seemingly underwhelming moth Pokemon could wreak absolute havoc on unprepared teams. With an excellent stat distribution and a unique typing, Volcarona can destroy most threats with its STAB Bug Buzz and Fire Blast / Fiery Dance combination alone. The remaining Pokemon who resist this formidable combination can be taken care of with a coverage move of choice, ranging from Psychic to Hurricane, to most typically a Hidden Power. Alternatively, Volcarona can forgo a coverage move for other useful options, such as Rest, Morning Sun, or even Substitute. Quiver Dance is one of the most dangerous set-up moves in the game, making Volcarona not only a fast and hard-hitting sweeper, but also very difficult to take down with special attacks. Revenge killers that would prey on Volcarona's poor Defense stat instead have to contend with its ability, Flame Body, which gives it a nice 30% chance to burn the user of a contact move. Despite Volcarona's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, if used with the proper support, Volcarona can sweep nearly any team.</p>

<h2>Defensive Threats</h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/242.png" alt="Blissey" /><br />

Base Stats: 255 HP / 10 Atk / 10 Def / 75 SpA / 135 SpD / 55 Spe<br />
Abilities: Natural Cure / Serene Grace / Healer</p>

<p>Despite receiving no new toys from BW, and in fact facing greater competition thanks to the huge buff to Chansey, the (original) pink blob proves frustratingly resilient. With a near-unmatched ability to wall just about any special attacker in the game, Blissey can find a place in any team hurting for a bit more special bulk. With a wide array of support moves, including Toxic, Thunder Wave, Heal Bell, and the newly buffed Wish that allows her to fully revitalize almost all Pokemon in the game, Blissey can be a fantastic team supporter, cleric, or status-spreader on stall and offensive teams alike. Despite being somewhat outclassed defensively by Eviolite Chansey, Blissey maintains some advantages of its own that account for its greater usage. First, her usable base 75 Special Attack stat means that Blissey can run Ice Beam or Flamethrower to take advantage of her surprising physical bulk—largely due to her fantastic HP stat; secondly, Leftovers negates residual damage Blissey may take from weather, and also helps offset whatever more damage she would take than Chansey. With massive Special Defense, decent physical Defense, a usable Special Attack and a good movepool, Blissey yet again proves that if something isn't broken, you need not fix it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/442.png" alt="Bronzong" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Bronzong"><strong>Bronzong</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 67 HP / 89 Atk / 116 Def / 79 SpA / 116 SpD / 33 Spe<br />
Abilities: Levitate / Heatproof / Heavy Metal</p>

<p>With fantastic mixed defenses, and a combination of typing and choice of abilities that gives it only one weakness, Bronzong is a fantastic mixed wall that can take on a multitude of threats without breaking a sweat. Thanks to its Steel typing, Bronzong is one of the few reliable checks to the ferocious Dragon-types that roam OU, including Latios and Haxorus. Bronzong functions brilliantly in a support role, as it can reliably set up Stealth Rock, as well as provide dual screens and Trick Room support. Bronzong also has the ability to go on the offense as a tank that can both take hits and deal damage; such a set commonly sports Earthquake, Gyro Ball, and Hidden Power Ice to take on as many different Pokemon as possible. However, Bronzong isn't completely invulnerable. Its low HP stat and lack of reliable recovery means that it will easily be whittled down over the course of the match. All in all, Bronzong is a competent Pokemon that when used rightly, will be a very effective use of a teamslot.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/113.png" alt="Chansey" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Chansey"><strong>Chansey</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 250 HP / 5 Atk / 5 Def / 35 SpA / 105 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Natural Cure / Serene Grace / Healer</p>

<p>In previous generations, Chansey found itself overshadowed by its evolution, Blissey, who had better stats both offensively and defensively. However, with the advent of BW came a new item, the Eviolite, which increases the defenses of NFE Pokemon by 50%. This instantly transformed Chansey into an enormously bulky Pokemon, who can wall a huge number of threats with defenses that now far surpass Blissey's, as well as reliable recovery in the form of Softboiled. BW also brought about a change in the mechanics of the move Wish; Chansey can now pass enormous 352 HP Wishes to its teammates. It can thus contribute to its team in many ways: aside from Wish, it gets access to status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, as well as Aromatherapy and Heal Bell. It can alternatively be a pure wall that focuses on walling threats and forcing switches with its huge defensive stats, chipping away at the opponent's health mainly through residual damage. However, Chansey remains completely outclassed by Blissey when it comes to offense. Despite having a fantastic special movepool, Chansey cannot put it to good use with its deplorable base 35 Special Attack and thus has to resort to Seismic Toss; this leaves Chansey without any form of direct offense against Ghost-types. Having to hold Eviolite also deprives Chansey of Leftovers recovery, a disadvantage particularly in unfavorable weather. Despite these flaws, Chansey shines as one of the best special walls in the metagame and is one defensive threat which every team should be prepared for.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/149.png" alt="Dragonite" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Dragonite"><strong>Dragonite</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 91 HP / 134 Atk / 95 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 80 Spe<br />
Abilities: Inner Focus / Multiscale</p>

<p>
Despite Dragonite's excellent natural bulk, it has usually been outclassed in one way or another in attempts to run defensive sets. Multiscale changed everything for Dragonite, making bulky Dragon Dance sets much harder to take down and creating new sets. In early BW, a set of Thunder Wave / Substitute / Roost / Dragon Tail began to catch on, its ability to paralyze hard hitters and wait for a full paralysis with Substitute and Roost made it a very tough wall to overcome and a very useful phazer. A Fire-type attack over Thunder Wave also catches a lot of normal counters, such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Tangrowth, off guard. Dragon Dance over Thunder Wave and Dragon Claw over Dragon Tail has become a bulky set-up sweeper famous for cleaning defensive teams as the last Pokemon. Lastly, Dragonite can run defensive sets in the rain with Hurricane posing a huge threat to Pokemon like Celebi and Virizion, which naturally trouble rain teams. Whether relentlessly setting up with Dragon Dance or phazing endlessly with Dragon Tail, Dragonite can be one of the greatest annoyances defensively if you don't prepare for it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/628.png" alt="Ferrothorn" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Ferrothorn"><strong>Ferrothorn</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 74 HP / 94 Atk / 131 Def / 54 SpA / 116 SpD / 20 Spe<br />
Ability: Iron Barbs</p>

<p>With 74 / 131 / 116 defenses and a typing which gives it useful resistances to common Dragon-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks, it is little wonder that Ferrothorn is one of the best walls in the game. In a metagame dominated by weather, Ferrothorn is an extremely useful check to rain-based teams, easily absorbing powerful attacks from the likes of Rotom-W, Starmie, and Kingdra. Ferrothorn's unique ability, Iron Barbs, also adds greatly to the headaches of physically based Pokemon and Rapid Spinners, and is an especially great way to pick off weakened Pokemon by just switching in. Ferrothorn's movepool is equally impressive: it can set up entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock, cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave and Toxic, mitigate its lack of a reliable recovery move with Leech Seed, Substitute, and Protect, and even set up with Curse. Ferrothorn is not invincible, though: a neutrality to Ground and a weakness to Fighting greatly hamper its physical walling capabilities. Powerful Fire-types such as Heatran and Infernape can easily incinerate Ferrothorn with their STAB attacks. This glaring quadruple weakness is also an invitation for many special sweepers that are otherwise helpless against Ferrothorn, such as Latios and the aforementioned Starmie and Rotom-W, to surprise it with Hidden Power Fire.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/205.png" alt="Forretress" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Forretress"><strong>Forretress</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 90 Atk / 140 Def / 60 SpA / 60 SpD / 40 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sturdy / Overcoat (Unreleased)</p>

<p>Forretress, the premier spinner of DPP, may have gained little this generation outside of a buffed Sturdy, but he still retains a very useful niche in the BW OU metagame. Access to all entry hazards and the ability to Rapid Spin go a long way toward making Forretress a virtual necessity for any stall team; an impressive physical Defense and salvageable Special Defense allow him to find a place on many balanced and even offensive teams as a reliable wall and pivot as well. Indeed, Forretress has far more on his resume than mere hazards work. With his colossal Defense, Forretress can tank most physical sweepers, and retaliate with his surprisingly usable base 90 Attack stat. STAB Gyro Ball along with his dismal Speed allows Forretress to counter many speedy sweepers, most frequently Outrage-locked Dragon-types. Whether one needs an unbreakable staller, a Rapid Spin user, a clutch counter, or a catch-all defensive giant, look no further than Forretress.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/428.png" alt="Gastrodon" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Gastrodon"><strong>Gastrodon</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 111 HP / 83 Atk / 68 Def / 92 SpA / 82 SpD / 39 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sticky Hold / Storm Drain / Sand Force</p>

<p>In the massive pool of bulky Water-type Pokemon, Gastrodon has finally received a niche above the others with Storm Drain, which now gives an immunity to Water-type attacks and a +1 boost to Special attack when hit by one. All of the previous benefits of its Water / Ground typing remain, like an immunity to sandstorm damage, and the added bonus of Storm Drain makes it an excellent special wall. Powerful attackers like Rotom-W and Starmie will need to run Hidden Power Grass to leave any lasting damage on this slug. The combination of the new move Scald and Toxic makes bulky Gastrodon fairly hard to switch into. Gastrodon is not only a strong check to rain-abusing sweepers; with Choice Specs it can be a sturdy cannon itself. If your opponent makes the mistake of hitting that type of Gastrodon with a Water-type attack, even Blissey is looking at a potential 2HKO.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/477.png" alt="Gliscor" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/gliscor"><strong>Gliscor</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 75 HP / 95 Atk / 125 Def / 45 SpA / 75 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Hyper Cutter / Sand Veil / Poison Heal</p>

<p>Gliscor needs no introduction: it is one of the most common sights in the OU metagame simply because it is able to counter and check prominent threats. Terrakion, which general consensus holds as one of the greatest threats in OU, is conditionally countered by it, and Landorus is also beaten unless it has Hidden Power Ice, making it a top-tier counter to offensive sandstorm-based teams. Indeed, perhaps the greatest testament to defensive Gliscor's effectiveness is the sheer number of physical Pokemon that run an Ice move solely for Gliscor: Tyranitar, Mienshao, and Virizion are just a few examples. While Gliscor's Dream World ability is incompatible with Roost, the combination of Toxic Orb + Poison Heal, and possibly even Substitute and Protect, is more than enough for it to last through the game.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/130.png" alt="Gyarados" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/gyarados"><strong>Gyarados</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 125 Atk / 79 Def / 60 SpA / 100 SpD / 81 Spe<br />
Abilities: Intimidate / Moxie</p>

<p>Since the release of RSE, when Gyarados recieved Intimidate, Gyarados has been a particularly tough Pokemon to take down. With 95 / 79 / 100 defenses, five resistances, and only two weaknesses, Gyarados can tank a vast amount of Pokemon. Throughout the DPP era, Gyarados was one of the best Fighting-resists in the game, lowering the opponent's Attack just by coming in, and then either setting up with Dragon Dance or simply tanking them with the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk. However, with Terrakion and Virizion becoming the more popular Fighting-types in BW OU, the RestTalk set has lost a bit of its luster. It is still a threat through its raw defenses and the new move Dragon Tail, which gives it approximately a 2/3 chance to phaze in it's sleep; Gyarados is one the very few Pokemon that can afford to run a RestTalk set with the BW sleep mechanics, resetting the sleep timer every time a Pokemon switches out. Substitute + Dragon Dance sets are also good for tanking hits and turn BW's standard bulky Water-types into set-up bait</p>

Base Stats: 108 HP / 112 Atk / 118 Def / 68 SpA / 72 SpD / 47 Spe<br />
Abilities: Sand Stream / Sand Force</p>

<p>The generation shift has not been especially generous to Hippowdon; however, its value as a physical wall has only increased with the plethora of new physical attackers introduced to the metagame, such as Terrakion and Landorus. With huge HP and Defense stats, Hippowdon is nigh impossible to take down with a physical attack, and its respectable Special Defense coupled with its great HP allow it to take several special hits with the right investment. A decent support movepool, with options such as Stealth Rock, Roar, Yawn, and Slack Off, further enables Hippowdon to help out its teammates with ease. Hippowdon's ability, Sand Stream, not only allows it to add more residual damage to the tally, but also makes it the perfect partner to a multitude of sand abusers, letting it find a place on all kinds of teams.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/623.png" alt="Jellicent" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Jellicent"><strong>Jellicent</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 60 Atk / 70 Def / 85 SpA / 105 SpD / 60 Spe<br />
Abilities: Water Absorb / Cursed Body / Damp</p>

<p>BW introduced a very welcome 2-in-1 Pokemon: Jellicent, simultaneously both a bulky Water and spinblocker. Along with Jellicent's unique Water / Ghost typing comes plenty of key resistances and immunities, two usable abilities in Water Absorb and Cursed Body, solid 100 / 70 / 105 defenses, instant recovery, a surprisingly decent offensive movepool, as well as support moves like Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Trick Room; in other words, all you could ask for. Jellicent's primary role on a team is typically to render Rapid Spin useless, which is why it is often found paired with a entry hazard layer, most commonly Ferrothorn. The FerroCent core is BW's answer to SkarmBliss: not only do their typings complement perfectly, Ferrothorn also sets up hazards which Jellicent then prevents the opponent from removing. Thanks to these traits, Jellicent can go toe-to-toe with some of the metagame's biggest threats, such as Heatran, Volcarona, Infernape, Terrakion, Swords Dance Lucario lacking Crunch, and Choice Band Scizor, just to name a few. Access to Toxic and Taunt also allow it to fare well against opposing bulky Water-types and walls. Jellicent does suffer from being setup bait for Pokemon such as ChestoRest variants of Volcarona, Nasty Plot Celebi, is largely shut down by faster Taunt users, and cannot stand up to the sheer power of the likes of Choice Specs Latios and Choice Band Haxorus. Nonetheless, if you need a solid defensive spinblocker and utility counter, this is the jellyfish for you.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/385.png" alt="Jirachi" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Jirachi"><strong>Jirachi</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Serene Grace</p>

<p>
Thanks to its large HP and balanced defensive stats, which are some of the most impressive in standard play, as well as its excellent defensive typing, Jirachi easily presents an insurmountable roadblock to thwart many an impending sweep. Jirachi is far from a passive sponge, however: its wide movepool allows it to be an extremely dynamic Pokemon. Jirachi is often seen spreading paralysis using either Thunder Wave or Body Slam, the latter of which has a 60% chance of paralysis thanks to Serene Grace. As a Normal-type attack, this gives Jirachi a niche ability to paralyze Ground-types. Jirachi is also an excellent team supporter with dual screens, Trick Room, or even Gravity, as it has U-turn to conserve momentum after setting up. Its Steel typing and immense special bulk further lets it check Dragon types, particularly Latios, sponging even Choice Specs Draco Meteors with ease. However, the main draw of defensive Jirachi is Wish. A multitude of resistances, great bulk, and the ability to outspeed a variety of threats even without investment lets Jirachi replenish its own health or that of a teammate reliably throughout the match. This variant of Jirachi often maximizes investment on its already large base HP stat to further enhance its capabilities, as with the BW Wish mechanics, Jirachi's 202 HP Wishes can often revitalize a teammate worn down by hazards, Life Orb recoil, or an untimely misprediction. Jirachi's ability to render damage to the rest of its team null and void is what makes it such a defensive threat: be sure to pack powerful Fire- or Ground-type attacks to deal with the star, as it is notoriously difficult to 2HKO otherwise.</p>

Base Stats: 80 HP / 80 Atk / 90 Def / 110 SpA / 130 SpD / 110 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>Despite losing Soul Dew in the generation shift, Latias still functions excellently as a special wall in standard play with her massive base 130 Special Defense, as well as neat resistances to Water-, Fire-, Electric-, Psychic-, and Fighting-type attacks. Wish Latias in particular partners very well with Ferrothorn: each covers the other's resistances almost flawlessly. Besides being able to pass Wish, Latias has access to Recover and Roost as well, allowing it to regain health in a single turn rather than two. This makes a bulky Calm Mind set an excellent choice for Latias, letting her boost her impressive Special Defense to outstanding levels and enabling her to hit very hard with STAB Dragon Pulse; Substitute, Wish, Roar, and Refresh all have good utility on this set for a variety of reasons. Finally, Latias can also be more of a team player by running an effective dual screens support set, making use of her great bulk and multitude of resistances to come in repeatedly during the match to perform her job.</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/151.png" alt="Mew" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Mew/ou"><strong>Mew</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 100 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 100 SpA / 100 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Ability: Synchronize</p>

<p>While Mew is sometimes seen packing an offensive punch with Nasty Plot, it can also go in the completely opposite direction as a very defensive Pokemon. With balanced base 100 defenses and access to an instant recovery move, it will not knuckle down easily. The ability to pass any type of boost—offensive as well as defensive—such as Amnesia, Calm Mind, and Bulk Up makes it perhaps the premier Baton Passer in existence. Dedicated Baton Pass variants typically carry moves that boost both an offensive stat and Speed, instantly making the recipient a true juggernaut. Mew is also a first-rate choice for a dual screens support on offense-oriented teams, as its excellent bulk and access to a speedy Taunt virtually guarantees protection for frail, high-powered sweepers. Finally, Mew's support set functions just as well on defensive teams, easily spreading status, denying its unfortunate opponent of recovery with Taunt, and stalling it out with Roost. In short, be wary of Mew, and the almost limitless options it brings to the table.</p>

Abilities: Trace / Download / Analytic</p>

<p>With the advent of Eviolite, what was once a niche OU counter has become a very intimidating tank capable of coming in on some of the top threats of OU and forcing them out. With Eviolite equipped, the range of attacks that can reliably KO Porygon2 shrink immensely, mostly leaving only powerful STAB Fighting attacks. Immense bulk, a fantastic ability in Trace, and reliable recovery enables Porygon2 to easily come in on many threats, such as Heatran, Gliscor, and Intimidate Salamence and Gyarados, and use their abilities against them. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt give it great coverage, Thunder Wave lets it provide paralysis support, and Recover offsets the loss of Leftovers healing. All in all, don't underestimate this strange duck, for it is an incredibly bulky tank capable of halting your sweeps and crippling your team</p>

Base Stats: 95 HP / 85 Atk / 85 Def / 65 SpA / 65 SpD / 35 Spe<br />
Abilities: Damp / Water Absorb / Unaware</p>

<p>After spending three entire generations being overshadowed by Swampert, Quagsire finally got his chance to shine in the OU metagame thanks to the magnificent gift he received from Dream World: Unaware. With the ability to ignore an opponent's stat boosts, a respectable amount of bulk, and Recover, Quagsire can easily check even the most dangerous physical sweepers such as Infernape, Cloyster, and Lucario. Quagsire can even run Curse to attempt to sweep, or Stockpile to become even harder to take down. However, as with any Pokemon, Quagsire isn't flawless. He's unable to touch Ferrothorn, often being setup fodder for Spikes and Stealth Rock. He also fears Toxic, cannot handle special sweepers as well as he can physical ones, and has a crippling weakness to Grass-type moves. Finally, he can be muscled through by sheer brute force such as a Choice Band Haxorus's Outrage. Nonetheless, these reasons should not put you off from giving Quagsire a chance, because this cute clueless blue blob can save you from many a tight spot.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/503.png" alt="Rotom-W" /><br />

Base Stats: 50 HP / 65 Atk / 107 Def / 105 SpA / 107 SpD / 86 Spe<br />
Ability: Levitate</p>

<p>While the loss of its Ghost typing (and thus its role as a spinblocker) has hurt Rotom-W as a defensive Pokemon, it still possesses a few important characteristics that make it worthy of a defensive role. Its changed typing, in addition to its ability, Levitate, allows it to resist a multitude of attacks in OU with only one true weakness (excluding Mold Breaker Earthquake). Additionally, its access to status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave makes Rotom-W quite hard to play around, especially when considering it has offensive utility as well. Perhaps what differentiates Rotom-W from other Pokemon besides its unique typing is Volt Switch; by using this move, Rotom-W is able to escape from switch-ins and counters, and thus maintain the momentum of the battle within its user's favor. Volt Switch, in combination with U-turn from another teammate (most commonly Scizor), has earned Rotom-W quite a reputation as one of the top Pokemon in the metagame.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/302.png" alt="Sableye" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Sableye/ou"><strong>Sableye</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 50 HP / 75 Atk / 75 Def / 65 SpA / 65 SpD / 50 Spe<br />
Abilities: Keen Eye / Stall / Prankster</p>

<p>Throughout previous generations and a fair chunk of BW, Sableye has been one of the weakest Pokemon in the game. However, the release of its Dream World ability, Prankster, has turned it into a legitimate threat. This ability, combined with the classic combination of a status move, Taunt, and a recovery move gives Sableye a unique defensive niche. Fast, powerful sweepers that would normally be able to pummel a slow wall or throw up a Substitute for status protection are swiftly burned by Will-O-Wisp, and will have trouble finishing off a weakened Sableye with its priority Recover. Stall-based teams are also heavily annoyed by Sableye, as it is a very effective stallbreaker with the aforementioned combo and a solid spinblocker at the same time. Starmie and Tentacruel are the only common Rapid Spin users with a good match-up against Sableye and both get blocked well by Rocky Helmet Ferrothorn, with burn support in the case of Tentacruel. Sableye's priority moves are useful in many more ways that are fun to discover when using it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/227.png" alt="Skarmory" /><br />

Base Stats: 65 HP / 80 Atk / 140 Def / 40 SpA / 70 SpD / 70 Spe<br />
Abilities: Keen Eye / Sturdy / Weak Armor</p>

<p>In a metagame dominated by powerful physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Conkeldurr, Skarmory stands out as a fantastic physical wall, courtesy of its unique Steel / Flying typing and huge base Defense stat. The generation shift also brought a useful buff to Skarmory's ability Sturdy, in effect giving it a Focus Sash whenever it is at full health. Reliable recovery in the form of Roost, a multitude of resistances thanks to its Steel typing, as well as a valuable Ground-type immunity help Skarmory wall a large number of threats, including but not limited to Landorus, Haxorus, and Conkeldurr. Skarmory can also utilize its physical bulk and typing to lay entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock; furthermore, it has Whirlwind and Taunt in its arsenal to phaze stat boosters, cause residual damage, and shut down slower walls such as Ferrothorn and Hippowdon. As far as attacking goes, Skarmory also has a powerful STAB Brave Bird to dent weak opponents. Despite all these positive characteristics, Skarmory's defensive capabilities are undermined by its poor Special Defense and weaknesses to common Electric- and Fire-type attacks, which means that Skarmory can easily be brought down by powerful special attackers such as Infernape, Rotom-W, Starmie, Magnezone, and Heatran. Still, its physical bulk and typing make Skarmory a very reliable physical wall and a great asset to any team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/80.png" alt="Slowbro" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/Slowbro/ou"><strong>Slowbro</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 95 HP / 75 Atk / 110 Def / 100 SpA / 80 SpD / 30 Spe<br />
Abilities: Oblivious / Own Tempo / Regenerator</p>

<p>Slowbro has been a superb choice for the role of physical bulky Water-type ever since he made his first appearance in RBY. BW has given Slowbro a significant boost with the ability Regenerator, which restores 1/3 of his HP when switching out. With a great typing, good defenses, and decent Special Attack, Slowbro can serve many roles; however, he is commonly first and foremost a physical wall. With his natural bulk and a choice of STAB moves such as Scald, Surf, Psychic, and Psyshock, he is a great counter to the many hard-hitting Fighting-types and physical sweepers that abound in OU, in particular Conkeldurr and Terrakion. This makes Slowbro one of the best anti-metagame Pokemon, as both these offensive threats are very common. Slowbro has a large support movepool, containing moves such as Yawn, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, as well as Slack Off for instant recovery. He can also support his team by setting up dual screens or Trick Room. Sets running Calm Mind increase Slowbro's walling prowess, making him not only a physical wall, but very hard to break specially as well. After a few boosts, he may also be able to go on the offensive and put quite a large dent in the opposing team, with good coverage options like Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Ice Beam. There are also Choice Specs Slowbro variants, which—don't laugh—can be surprisingly hard to counter due to his impressive coverage and good base Special Attack, not to mention access to Trick to instantly cripple any unsuspecting defensive Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/73.png" alt="Tentacruel" /><br />

Base Stats: 80 HP / 70 Atk / 65 Def / 80 SpA / 120 SpD / 100 Spe<br />
Abilities: Clear Body / Liquid Ooze / Rain Dish</p>

<p>While at first glance Tentacruel may appear to be just another run-of-the-mill bulky Water-type, it possesses a few qualities that let it stand out from the pack. First is its interesting Water / Poison typing, which bestows on Tentacruel resistances to many common attacking types, as well as the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes upon entering the field. Along with its ability to use Rapid Spin, as well as set up its own Toxic Spikes, this goes a long way towards earning it a spot on most stall or defensively-orientated teams. Its Rain Dish ability in particular works excellently on rain-based stall, giving it phenomenal recovery and alleviating perhaps its greatest weakness: its lack of a reliable recovery move. Liquid Ooze, on the other hand, has the niche of letting it counter the few Pokemon that use health-draining moves, particularly special Virizion, Conkeldurr, and Ferrothorn. In short, Tentacruel, although an uncommon Pokemon, is capable of many great things if used correctly.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/134.png" alt="Vaporeon" /><br />

Base Stats: 130 HP / 65 Atk / 60 Def / 110 SpA / 95 SpD / 65 Spe<br />
Abilities: Water Absorb / Hydration</p>

<p>Vaporeon still plays mostly the same way as it has since ADV, a bulky Water-type that can pass Wish and packs a punch with an above average base 110 Special Attack stat. Vaporeon certainly got its fair share of gifts through the Black and White release though; Wish heals any recipient's HP by half of the user's, letting Vaporeon really take advantage of its base 130 HP stat. Scald is also useful for a potential burn, making it easier to wall physical attacks and wear down opposing tanks. The biggest boost Vaporeon received though is Drizzle Politoed; Hydration gives it a complete immunity to status under rain, meaning it has nothing to fear from bulky status-inducing Pokemon; it is one of the very few tanks that isn't annoyed by stallbreaker Mew. This ability also lets it Rest and recover all of its health instantly; you're essentially using a Full Restore on it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/202.png" alt="Wobbuffet" /><br />

Base Stats: 190 HP / 33 Atk / 58 Def / 33 SpA / 58 SpD / 33 Spe<br />
Abilities: Shadow Tag / Telepathy</p>

<p>Most Pokemon can be classed into a few broad categories: sweeper, wall, tank, etc. Wobbuffet cannot, however, because it is completely unique in what it does, thanks to its ability, Shadow Tag. With the opponent unable to switch, Wobbuffet can use Counter and Mirror Coat together with its colossal HP stat to KO almost anything, especially if said opponent is Choice-locked. It can also use Encore against Pokemon which try to set up against it, and Tickle against Pokemon like Blissey, who can then be smacked by a teammate's Pursuit for an easy KO. Its tiny movepool also contains Safeguard, which can stop Encored status moves from harming incoming sweepers, and Destiny Bond, which can hopefully help Wobbuffet take down one more Pokemon with it, or at least after the Custap Berry is released. Unfortunately, these last two are not used much because of Wobbuffet's poor Speed, and it literally has no other moves available to it but Splash. Nonetheless, it does not need anything more to become the ultimate anti-metagame Pokemon that it is. Team Preview has made preparing for Wobbuffet slightly easier, but it is as uncounterable as ever, and a definite threat in the OU tier.</p>

<a href="/bw/pokemon/Xatu/ou"><strong>Xatu</strong></a><br />
Base Stats: 65 HP / 75 Atk / 70 Def / 95 SpA / 70 SpD / 95 Spe<br />
Abilities: Synchronize / Early Bird / Magic Bounce</p>

<p>Thanks to the emergence of its Dream World ability, Magic Bounce, Xatu can finally make the cut for BW OU. Its new ability works as an automatic Magic Coat, allowing the Aztec bird to reflect entry hazards, status moves, and phazing moves aimed at its team. Couple this with a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves, a Ground-type immunity, as well as resistances to Grass- and Psychic-type moves, and you have the makings of a good defensive switch-in to Blissey, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon. Additionally, Xatu isn't just a sitting duck; it has several helpful support moves to use during its time on the field, such as Featherdance, Light Screen, Reflect, Toxic, and even Thunder Wave. When taking its natural immunity to Taunt and Encore into consideration, Xatu is pretty much guaranteed to gain momentum and support its team before fainting in nearly any match. Although Xatu may falter in battle due to its multiple common weaknesses and only decent defensive stats, one can still count on it as a reliable answer against many opposing defensive Pokemon.</p>
