<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>Trick Room is a highly offensive playstyle that quite literally turns the metagame on its head. When Trick Room is set up, slower Pokemon will move first in battle, with one single exception: a Pokemon with over 1809 Speed (though Choice Scarf Ninjask is hardly a threat). In a metagame obsessed with Speed tiers, Speed creeping, and fast sweepers, this strategy can be devastating. Powerful attackers that are normally too slow to pull off a sweep, such as Aggron or Marowak, transform into unstoppable killing machines. Unfortunately, setting up Trick Room is rather difficult, and careful team building must be stressed. Due to its -7 priority, moves such as Taunt, Whirlwind, and Roar can guarantee that Trick Room is not put into effect. Furthermore, Trick Room only lasts for 5 turns, including the turn it is set up, meaning you have just 4 turns to take advantage of its effects before having to set it up all over again. Unlike the weathers, there is no auto-inducer for Trick Room, or even an item like Damp Rock that stretches its duration to 8 turns. Despite these shortcomings, when it is up, few teams can handle the unabashed offensive fury that a well built Trick Room team can unleash.</p>

<h2><a name="play">Playstyle:</a></h2>

<p>Despite Trick Room teams being based around slow Pokemon, it is an incredibly fast-paced playstyle. Every Trick Room sweeper must be immediately threatening from the onset, as they will not have enough time to set up before sweeping. While the Trick Room users may be able to grab a quick Nasty Plot or Swords Dance boost before setting up Trick Room, the strain of setting up two moves, and Trick Room's limited timer, often cuts their sweep short. It is imperative that the team as a whole is capable of dealing as much damage as possible, as quickly as possible. Entry hazards are a welcomed addition to any Trick Room team, but again, it can be difficult to set them up while setting up Trick Room as well.</p>

<p>While offensive presence is key to a Trick Room team's success, defenses are extremely important as well. As Trick Room only lasts for 5 turns, your users and sweepers will be subjected to constant switching. Entry hazards and attack damage can quickly take its toll on any team that lacks proper bulk. Furthermore, your team's Speed will be abysmal outside of Trick Room, so they must be able to withstand the onslaught of faster opponents outside of Trick Room. This is further compromised by Trick Room's -7 priority, which guarantees your Pokemon will always be going second when setting it up. Even under Trick Room, your sweepers must be able to handle priority attacks, which bypass Trick Room's Speed reversal. Thankfully, never investing in Speed allows Trick Room team members to invest in bulk that other sweepers cannot afford to run.</p>

<p>There are a number of utility moves that work wonderfully in Trick Room. Substitute is a great move for any Trick Room sweeper, as it allows the sweeper to scout a switch, protect itself from status, and give itself an opportunity to remain threatening even after Trick Room's counter has run out. Priority attacks are also crucial, as they are the only way your slow sweepers will be able to dish out damage after the twisted dimensions have returned to normal. Any move that can get a sweeper in quickly and for free is a great boon for Trick Room users. Explosion, Destiny Bond, and Memento can all cripple an opponent at the cost of the users life, and allow a sweeper to switch in without fear of attacks. Sleep can shut down an opponent and force a switch, which allows the Sleep user a free switch. "Slow" U-turns, Baton Passes, or Volt Switches allow the user to take the hit first, so the incoming sweeper takes no damage. Finally, perhaps the greatest asset to have is Healing Wish; with it, a user such as Mesprit or Audino can set up Trick Room, sacrifice themselves to get a sweeper in for free, and that sweeper will be fully healed and relieved of status, allowing it to rip into your opponents team a second time.</p>

<h2><a name="threats">Threats to Trick Room Teams</a></h2>

<p>Although Trick Room is a superb strategy, it is not without its downsides. Taunt is one of the biggest problems it faces, as it removes your ability to set up Trick Room itself. Though paralysis will only make your Pokemon "faster" under Trick Room, an untimely full paralysis can be quite costly. Sleep completely shuts down one of your team members, leaving you to fight a 5 vs 6 battle. Toxic poisoning and burn can quickly wear down your Trick Room users, and burn in particular can completely nerf one of your physical sweepers. Substitute and Protect can also be used to stall out your Trick Room timer, forcing you to set up all over again. Finally, Encore can lock your Pokemon into a non-attacking move, such as Trick Room or Substitute, forcing you to waste a turn of Trick Room's duration by switching. Phazing moves, such as Roar and Whirlwind, also move before Trick Room, due to its -7 priority. All of these problems can be solved by running a Taunt user of your own; Whimsicott is perhaps the best suited for this role, as it gains priority on Taunt, allowing it to shut down other Taunt users. A cleric, or at least Healing Wish support, can help with status issues. Multi-hit moves, such as Marowak's Bonemerang and Klinklang's Gear Grind, can help break through Substitutes, though their poor accuracy is a drawback.</p>

<p>Not all of Trick Room's problems can be fixed with Taunt, however. Priority attacks are a huge threat to Trick Room teams, as they retain their priority even under the field effect. Mach Punch, Shadow Sneak, or a well timed Sucker Punch can spell disaster for one of your sweepers. Using Substitute, or priority attacks of your own, is the best away around this weakness. Slow Curse users, such as Munchlax and Steelix, will only become faster, stronger, and bulkier under Trick Room, turning them into massive threats to your team. Pokemon that happen to run negative Speed natures, such as Ferroseed and Pain Split Spiritomb, can also outspeed some of your sweepers under Trick Room. A powerful Fighting-type, such as Hariyama or Gallade, can handle Munchlax, Steelix, and Ferroseed, while Spiritomb can be overcome by simply bashing it with powerful attacks, such as Aggron's Head Smash. As most Trick Room users are Psychic- or Ghost-type, Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon can be very threatening to your team as well. Being able to resist these assaults can make a huge difference, so having a Steel-type, such as Aggron or Klinklang, or a Dark-type, such as Spiritomb or Crawdaunt, is highly recommended.</p>

<h2><a name="users">Trick Room Users:</a></h2>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/485.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/uxie">Uxie</a></h4>
<p>75 / 75 / <strong>130</strong> / 75 / <strong>130</strong> / 95</p>

<p>The first thing anyone looking at Uxie should notice is its incredible 75 / 130 / 130 defenses. This awesome bulk allows him to switch in time and time again and consistently set up Trick Room for his team. A handy immunity to Ground-type attacks, as well as Spikes and Toxic Spikes, is also a boon. While base 95 Speed is usually quite undesirable for a Trick Room user, Uxie is lucky enough to have U-turn in his arsenal; after setting up Trick Room, he will often be "slower" than opposing Pokemon, allowing him to tank a hit before U-turning out to an appropriate sweeper. Uxie also comes loaded with several useful support moves, the most notable being Stealth Rock and Heal Bell. Entry hazards are always a plus for helping sweepers net certain KOs, and Heal Bell is extremely useful for relieving pesky status, such as a burn on a physical sweeper. Though his offenses certainly aren't anything to write home about, Uxie's movepool is varied and he packs enough of a punch to soften up the opposing team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/199.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/slowking">Slowking</a></h4>
<p>95 / 75 / 80 / <strong>100</strong> / <strong>110</strong> / <strong>30</strong></p>

<p>Slowking is the premier bulky Water-type for Trick Room teams in RU. His special bulk is more than enough to provide him with multiple switch in opportunities, and his physical bulk isn't too shabby, either. Slowking also has access to Scald, which can net a lucky burn on a physical attack and greatly assist his tanking abilities. Regenerator is a wonderful ability for a Trick Room user, as they will often be switching out to sweepers and can always use the added health for later switch-ins. Slack Off provides Slowking with more reliable recovery, while Yawn can be used to force a switch, allowing a sweeper to get in unscathed. Much like Cofagrigus, Slowking can also utilize a Nasty Plot + Trick Room set to great effect. With just Trick Room and 3 attacks, Slowking becomes one of the most effective Trick Room sweepers, as well. Surf, Psychic, Psyshock, Fire Blast, Grass Knot, Ice Beam, and a plethora of other attacks give him added versatility for providing any offensive coverage your team might need.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/482.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/dusknoir">Dusknoir</a></h4>
<p>45 / 100 / <strong>135</strong> / 65 / <strong>135</strong> / <strong>45</strong></p>

<p>With solid mixed bulk, Dusknoir can find the opportunity to switch in and set up repeatedly. Two useful immunities to Fighting- and Normal-type attacks also helps a lot. With Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split, he can stall out walls that would otherwise be problematic for your team; that pitiful base 45 HP is actually a blessing for Pain Split. Offensively, Dusknoir packs two very useful priority attacks: Sucker Punch and STAB Shadow Sneak. With Fighting-type attacks, such as Brick Break or Focus Punch, alongside his Ghost STAB, Dusknoir gains perfect type coverage. Finally, should he fear that the end is near, he has access to Destiny Bond to bring down his foe with him and get a sweeper in for free.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/480.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/gallade">Gallade</a></h4>
<p>68 / <strong>125</strong> / 65 / 65 / <strong>115</strong> / 80</p>

<p>Though Gallade might not have the awesome bulk of some of the other Trick Room users on this list, his sheer power is often enough to force switches and allow him to set up. His Special Defense is certainly quite good, and his Defense can be boosted with Bulk Up. Only possessing two weaknesses to less common attack types (Flying and Ghost) is also a plus. It is on the offensive that Gallade is a true threat, however. He has two methods of boosting that solid base 125 Attack: Swords Dance and Bulk Up. Thanks to the ability Justified, he also gets a handy boost to his Attack when hit by Dark-type moves, which are often problematic for other Trick Room users. His physical movepool is also wide enough for him to make good use of that Attack stat. Priority in the form of Shadow Sneak is always welcomed on Trick Room teams, and it offers perfect coverage with his STAB Fighting-type attacks. Support options such as Taunt, Memento, and even the shaky Hypnosis also add to the unpredictability of this powerhouse.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/631.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/klinklang">Klinklang</a></h4>
<p>60 / <strong>100</strong> / <strong>115</strong> / 70 / 85 / 90</p>

<p>As the only Trick Room user that resists Dark-type attacks, Klinklang is a valuable asset to many teams. With 10 other resists and an immunity, its pure Steel typing is a blessing. Though base 90 Speed is quite high for Trick Room, Klinklang benefits greatly from it; access to Volt Switch means it can set up Trick Room and take a hit before switching to a sweeper. Its unique move, Gear Grind, is also useful for Trick Room teams, as it can break opposing Substitutes that would otherwise cut into your valuable momentum. Finally, status in the form of Toxic can be very useful for wearing down walls that wish to stall out Trick Room's timer.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/486.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/mesprit">Mesprit</a></h4>
<p>80 / 105 / <strong>105</strong> / 105 / <strong>105</strong> / 80</p>

<p>With very good mixed defensive stats, Mesprit is certainly bulky enough to set up Trick Room. Unlike her cousin, Uxie, she poses a serious offensive threat as well, and is capable of mixed attacking. Her offensive movepool is wonderful, largely aiding her ability to sweep. However, her support movepool is where she really shines. Stealth Rock support is always useful for helping sweepers achieve key KOs, and Mesprit reliably provides it. Her base 80 Speed allows her to be "slower" in Trick Room, so she can take a hit for and switch out to a sweeper with U-turn. The greatest support Mesprit offers to Trick Room teams, however, is Healing Wish. By sacrificing herself with this move, she can restore an injured sweeper back to full health and cure them of status, giving them 3 turns wreak more havoc on the opposing team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/636.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/beheeyem">Beheeyem</a></h4>
<p>75 / 75 / 75 / <strong>125</strong> / 95 / <strong>40</strong></p>

<p>Beheeyem seems custom built to be a Trick Room user and sweeper. With pitiful Speed and amazing Special Attack, he becomes a fearsome killing machine after setting up. Access to Nasty Plot only furthers his power, as he reaches an impressive 766 Special Attack after a single boost. His defenses, though not stunning, provide him with enough bulk to set up Nasty Plot and Trick Room. His STAB Psychic hits incredibly hard, and Thunderbolt provides excellent coverage alongside it. Few Pokemon in the tier can withstand that attack combination, and even fewer have enough bulk to truly keep him in check.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/559.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/audino">Audino</a></h4>
<p><strong>103</strong> / 60 / <strong>86</strong> / 60 / <strong>86</strong> / 50</p>

<p>Audino is a deceptively bulky wall that offers several useful tools for supporting her teammates. She passes the biggest Wishes of any Trick Room user in RU, and, thanks to Regenerator, heals herself in the process. Heal Bell can be used to eliminate any status that is plaguing your team, while access to dual screens allows Audino to beef up your defenses. Her biggest selling point, however, is Healing Wish, which allows her to completely rejuvenate a battered ally so they can plow through a team once more.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/235.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/smeargle">Smeargle</a></h4>
<p>55 / 20 / 35 / 20 / 45 / 75</p>

<p>Smeargle sadly boasts no useful stats at all; even his Speed is a bit high for Trick Room. However, what he lacks in stats, he more than makes up for in his movepool; it is, in fact, the largest movepool in the game, only lacking SelfDestruct and Explosion. While this makes the sets he can run nearly endless, his stats are quite limiting in what he can effectively pull off. Perhaps his best set is run at just Level 1, to minimize his stats even further. By using a Focus Sash, Smeargle can guarantee he will set up Trick Room. From there, he can use either Spore or Endeavor to completely cripple an opponent. Dragon Rage works perfectly with this, as it always deals 40 damage and can finish off anything that has been Endeavored by Smeargle.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/546.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/musharna">Musharna</a></h4>
<p><strong>116</strong> / 55 / 85 / <strong>107</strong> / 95 / <strong>29</strong></p>

<p>Musharna has a massive amount of bulk, making her ideal for setting up Trick Room. She also comes with a plethora of support options. Dual screens is great for upping her team's bulk, while Yawn can easily force a switch to get a sweeper in for free. Baton Pass also lets her take a hit before switching to a teammate, but her low Speed makes her less suited for this under Trick Room. That horrendous base 29 Speed does thankfully make her well suited for the role of a Trick Room sweeper, and her impressive base 107 Special Attack is certainly worth acknowledging. Psychic offers good STAB, while Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide flawless coverage. Moonlight is a great option for keeping her healthy, though it is less effective if your opponent is running a rain team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/575.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/whimsicott">Whimsicott</a></h4>
<p>60 / 67 / 85 / 77 / 75 / 116</p>

<p>Based purely on stats, Whimsicott looks like a horrible choice for a Trick Room user. It's not particularly bulky, it lacks offensive presence, and it's Speed is sky high. However, its ability, Prankster, sets it apart from any other Trick Room user. Whimsicott gains a level of priority on all of its support moves, meaning its Trick Room is only -6 priority and can go off before Roar or Whirlwind. The fun doesn't stop there, either. With priority Taunt, Whimsicott can stop other Taunt users and any other non-attacking move that threatens your team. It can also lock an opponent that dares to set up on you into their set up move, thanks to priority Encore. Useful moves such as Substitute and Leech Seed also gain priority, and Whimsicott boasts an extremely fast U-turn that allows it to take a hit for your incoming sweeper.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/103.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/exeggutor">Exeggutor</a></h4>
<p>95 / 95 / 85 / <strong>125</strong> / 65 / <strong>55</strong></p>

<p>Exeggutor has just the right amount of physical bulk to easily set up Trick Room. Once it's set up, he quickly transforms into a fearsome threat thanks to that base 125 Special Attack. Leaf Storm, Psychic, and various Hidden Powers offer plenty of coverage for him to pull off a sweep. Sleep Powder is one of his biggest selling points, as it allows him to cripple a threat to your team and give you some much needed momentum. Explosion, though coming off of his weaker base 95 Attack, still packs a decent punch and allows him to bring in a sweeper free of charge.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/608.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/duosion">Duosion</a></h4>
<p>65 / 40 / 50 / <strong>125</strong> / 60 / <strong>30</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to Magic Guard, Duosion is immune to indirect damage, such as entry hazards and Toxic. Though its bulk might not look like much, Eviolite works wonders to fix it. Base 30 Speed and base 125 Special Attack is perfect for a Trick Room sweeper, allowing it to easily outspeed and destroy its opponents under Trick Room. Psychic or Psyshock offers solid STAB, and Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball grant it perfect type coverage. Focus Sash can also be used to guarantee Duosion sets up Trick Room, and it doesn't fear entry hazards breaking the sash thanks to Magic Guard. Its bulk usually suffices, however. Recover is also a handy option for regaining health, though it hinders Duosion's excellent coverage and ability to sweep.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/354.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/banette">Banette</a></h4>
<p>64 / <strong>115</strong> / 65 / 83 / 63 / <strong>65</strong></p>

<p>Much like Smeargle, Banette best serves as a suicide Trick Room lead with a Focus Sash equipped. Unlike his more versatile friend, however, he boasts a good base 115 Attack stat to maintain some offensive presence. He's fairly straight forward to use; first, set up Trick Room as your opponent attacks, leaving you with just 1 HP. Then, use Destiny Bond as they attack once more, bringing down your foe and offering a free switch in for one of your sweepers. Taunt can guarantee that the opponent must attack, while Shadow Claw offers a decent attack of your own. Shadow Sneak is another option if you are looking for a good priority move, as it allows Banette to score some damage should he be Taunted before setting up Trick Room. Curse is also a nifty option that allows Banette to KO himself at low health while quickly wearing down the foe, a feat to which Smeargle cannot boast.</p>

<h2><a name="sweepers">Trick Room Sweepers:</a></h2>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/306.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/aggron">Aggron</a></h4>
<p>70 / <strong>110</strong> / <strong>180</strong> / 60 / 60 / <strong>50</strong></p>

<p>Aggron's massive physical bulk allows him to switch in with ease. His plethora of resistances, including the ever useful resistances to Dark- and Ghost-tye attacks, make him a prime choice for a Trick Room team. Though 4x weaknesses to Ground and Fighting cut back on that awesome physical bulk, the levitating Psychic-types that use Trick Room thankfully don't lure those sorts of attacks. With low Speed and great Attack, he can immediately present himself as a threat. Undoubtedly, his best attack is Head Smash; with that STAB Base Power 150 attack, he can break through even those that dare to resist it, and, thanks to Rock Head, he takes no recoil in the process.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/651.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/druddigon">Druddigon</a></h4>
<p>77 / <strong>120</strong> / 90 / 60 / 90 / <strong>48</strong></p>

<p>Druddigon offers several great resistances and sizable enough bulk that he can often switch in with ease. Once in, he can take advantage of his fantastic base 120 Attack and 48 Speed to start blasting through the opposition. Dragon is undoubtedly the best neutral STAB one can employ, resisted only by the rare Steel-types in RU, and such neutral coverage is highly desired for the fast-paced style of Trick Room. Outrage is a great STAB attack with Base Power 120, but Dragon Claw is a useful alternative for not getting locked in or confused. Sucker Punch is wonderful priority to wield both inside and outside of Trick Room, and Superpower allows Druddigon to break through those pesky Steel-types.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/105.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/marowak">Marowak</a></h4>
<p>60 / 80 / <strong>110</strong> / 50 / 80 / <strong>45</strong></p>

<p>Marowak at first appears to be an odd choice for a Trick Room sweeper; though his Speed is certainly perfect for the condition, and his physical defense is good enough, his offensive stats are nothing to write home about. It is his unique item that allows him to stand out from the pack, however. Thick Club doubles his Attack stat, which reaches a whopping 568 without any set up needed. Earthquake is reliable STAB, but Bonemerang is a handy alternative for breaking through Substitutes. Stone Edge offers great coverage alongside either, while Double Edge has Base Power 120 and no recoil thanks to Marowak's ability, Rock Head.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/342.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/crawdaunt">Crawdaunt</a></h4>
<p>63 / <strong>120</strong> / 85 / 90 / 55 / <strong>55</strong></p>

<p>Though Crawdaunt doesn't boast the greatest bulk, his resistances to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks makes switching him in easier. He also boasts useful resistances to Water- and Ice-type attacks, which often plague his sweeping comrades. With STAB alone, he offers great coverage in Water / Dark. His ability is what really makes him so threatening, as Adaptability turns his STAB multiplier into 2x. Coming off of his great base 120 Attack, both of his STABs can plow through almost any threat in the metagame. Superpower is a useful coverage move for hitting the likes of Ferroseed and company, which do resist the combination.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/664.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/zweilous">Zweilous</a></h4>
<p>72 / 85 / 70 / 65 / 70 / <strong>58</strong></p>

<p>Behold the strongest Outrage in the game. Thanks to Zweilous's ability, Hustle, his attacks become so powerful that even Rayquaza blushes. He also boasts six resistances and an immunity, and, being a not fully evolved Pokemon, can use Eviolite to boost his defenses to impressive levels. He works great in a double Dragon strategy alongside Druddigon, as one can soften opposing Steel-types to open up a sweep for the other. Though he might look more appealing than Druddigon, he is not without his drawbacks. Hustle, though great for boosting his physical attacks, also causes their accuracy to drop 20%. Unfortunately, with only a few turns on the Trick Room timer, a miss can be incredibly costly. That said, when Outrage does hit, and it usually does, absolutely nothing wants to be on the receiving end of it.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/412.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/rampardos">Rampardos</a></h4>
<p>97 / <strong>165</strong> / 60 / 65 / 50 / <strong>58</strong></p>

<p>Rampardos is the official glass canon of Trick Room teams everywhere. Though its 97 / 60 / 60 defenses certainly aren't horrendous, his defensive typing is not the best. His Speed is just right for Trick Room, however, and his massive base 165 Attack stat is what really makes him stand out. The only Pokemon that can boast a higher Attack stat in the game is Deoxys-A, and that won't be dropping down to RU anytime soon. Stone Edge is a great STAB attack, but if you don't mind a bit of recoil, Head Smash offers a far more incredible amount of damage output. Rampardos's ability, Mold Breaker, allows him to hit opponents with Levitate while using Earthquake, making him one of the most threatening users of the QuakeEdge combination under Trick Room.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/297.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/hariyama">Hariyama</a></h4>
<p><strong>144</strong> / <strong>120</strong> / 60 / 40 / 60 / <strong>50</strong></p>

<p>Hariyama's bulk is tremendous, making him one of the easiest Trick Room sweepers to switch in. Fighting typing gives him some solid resistances, and it allows him to burst through the Dark-types that plague your Trick Room users, and Steel-types that wall Druddigon and Zweilous. Base 120 Attack is certainly impressive, and with a Toxic Orb attached, he gains a Guts boost to increase it by 50%. Even better, he can take advantage of priority Bullet Punch, allowing him to pick off weakened foes even after Trick Room has run out.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/112.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/rhydon">Rhydon</a></h4>
<p>105 / <strong>130</strong> / <strong>120</strong> / 45 / 45 / <strong>40</strong></p>

<p>Rhydon boasts incredible phsyical defense, giving him a fairly easy time switching in. His impressive base 130 Attack and base 40 Speed makes him among the top threats under Trick Room. Perhaps his biggest selling point, however, is his incredible offense coverage; Rhydon receives STAB on the EdgeQuake combination, allowing him to threaten almost every opponent in the metagame. The only somewhat common sight in RU that resists that combination is Torterra, and Rhydon boasts access to Megahorn for dealing with it. With perfect coverage in three moves, Substitute is ideal in the final slot, allowing him to scout for a switch and remain a threat outside of Trick Room.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/217.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/ursaring">Ursaring</a></h4>
<p>90 / <strong>130</strong> / 75 / 75 / 75 / <strong>55</strong></p>

<p>Ursaring is beast under Trick Room. His incredible base 130 Attack allows him to smash the opponent hard. Guts is what makes him truly shine, however; a Toxic Orb not only powers up his Attack by 50%, but it gives him a great Base Power 140 STAB attack to work with, Facade. His physical movepool also boasts Close Combat for dealing with Rock- and Steel-types, and Crunch for hitting Ghosts, meaning he can break through whatever resists his main STAB. His bulk isn't half bad either, providing him with decent opportunities to switch in, especially on Ghost-type attacks aimed at your Trick Room users.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/470.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/tangrowth">Tangrowth</a></h4>
<p>100 / 100 / <strong>125</strong> / <strong>110</strong> / 50 / <strong>50</strong></p>

<p>Tangrowth has an incredible amount of physical bulk, allowing him to switch in with ease. Regenerator is a wonderful ability for him, as it heals him up while he switches back out after Trick Room ends. His base 50 Speed is perfect for Trick Room abuse, while both of his offensive stats are quite impressive. He also boasts a large enough movepool to take full advantage of a mixed sweeper role, allowing him to break past physical and special walls by preying on their weaker defense stat. Finally, Sleep Powder is a great move for a Trick Room sweeper, as it can cripple a would-be counter and allow Tangrowth to continue bashing his way through the opponent's team.</p>

<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/clamperl">Clamperl</a></h4>
<p>35 / 64 / 85 / 74 / 55 / <strong>32</strong></p>

<p>I know, I know: Clamperl. Seriously, don't laugh, though. Thanks to its unique item, DeepSeaTooth, her Special Attack reaches 542, making her the equivalent of a specially based Marowak. Unfortunately, she does not wield the same defensive prowess of her aforementioned friend, so Trick Room users that can get her in safely with Explosion or a "slow" U-turn are greatly appreciated. Once in, she is a true menace to the opponent, blasting off incredibly powerful Surfs, Ice Beams, and Hidden Powers. Substitute is a great option for her, as it allows her to scout the opponent and keep up momentum outside of Trick Room.</p>

<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/octillery">Octillery</a></h4>
<p>75 / <strong>105</strong> / 75 / <strong>105</strong> / 75 / <strong>45</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to its dual base 105 offensive stats, Octillery can easily take on the role of a mixed sweeper for your team. Its special movepool is particularly appealing, as it contains the rare Water Spout, as well as some odd but extremely helpful moves for a Water-type, such as Fire Blast and Energy Ball. Its defenses aren't too shabby either, and it can invest in the more should it opt to run purely special set. Sniper is a fantastic ability for it, albeit one that relies on luck. With Sniper, any critical hit Octillery scores will cause 3x damage, meaning a bit of hax on your side will almost always result in an OHKO.</p>

<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/glaceon">Glaceon</a></h4>
<p>65 / 60 / 110 / <strong>130</strong> / 95 / <strong>65</strong></p>

<p>While Glaceon appears to have decent bulk, don't be fooled; whereas its pure Ice typing is fantastic offensively, it can be something of a curse defensively. However, this defensive drawback is outweighed by Glaceon's massive base 130 Special Attack. The loss of Snover from the tier really cut back on Glaceon's ability to just spam Blizzard, but Ice Beam is still a powerful attack that can net the occasional lucky freeze. Shadow Ball can help her destroy any Ghost-types plaguing your team, while Hidden Power offers coverage of your choice. Baton Pass is useful as well, allowing Glaceon to scout out the opponent's switch-in and go to a more appropriate counter.</p>

<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/bouffalant">Bouffalant</a></h4>
<p>95 / <strong>110</strong> / 95 / 40 / 95 / <strong>55</strong></p>

<p>Bouffalant boasts solid bulk and a handy immunity to Ghost-type attacks, making him an excellent defensive pivot for your team. His base 110 Attack is quite good, and that low Speed stat becomes amazing under Trick Room. While Sap Sipper can provide an Attack boost from any Grass-type attacks aimed at Slowking or Rhyhorn, Reckless can power up his strongest STAB attack, Head Charge. Bouffalant also has solid coverage with the QuakeEdge combination and Megahorn, meaning nothing is truly safe from his assaults.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/348.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/armaldo">Armaldo</a></h4>
<p>75 / <strong>125</strong> / 100 / 70 / 80 / <strong>45</strong></p>

<p>Armaldo's incredible base 125 Attack and pitiful base 45 Speed are just right for Trick Room. Rock- and Bug-type STABs are always useful offensively, and Earthquake rounds out coverage perfectly. STAB X-Scissor in particular is a welcomed sight for Trick Room users, as they are in constant fear of opposing Dark-types. Armaldo's defenses are certainly high enough to give him proper bulk, though a Stealth Rock weakness cuts into that a bit. On the topic of entry hazards, he is hands down the best offensive spinner to use on an RU Trick Room team, giving him a vital niche.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/332.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/cacturne">Cacturne</a></h4>
<p>70 / <strong>115</strong> / 60 / <strong>115</strong> / 60 / <strong>55</strong></p>

<p>Though his defenses leave a bit to be desired, Cacturne has immunities to Psychic- and, when using Water Absorb, Water-type attacks. His low Speed and dual base 115 offensive stats allow him be a great mixed sweeper for Trick Room. STAB priority Sucker Punch is extremely useful, both inside and outside of Trick Room. His greatest utility, however, is his ability to function as an offensive Spiker. Due to the constant switching that occurs when facing Trick Room, any entry hazards are great for weakening the opposing team so your sweepers can finish it off.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/447.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/spiritomb">Spiritomb</a></h4>
<p>50 / 92 / <strong>108</strong> / 92 / <strong>108</strong> / <strong>35</strong></p>

<p>With a good amount of bulk, absolutely no weaknesses, and 3 immunities, Spiritomb is an incredibly easy sweeper to switch in. Though he does not have as high of an attack as some of the other sweepers on this list, his access to two STAB priority attacks in Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak make him a very valuable teammate. He also blocks Rapid Spin, which is useful for teams that use Cacturne or Uxie to set up entry hazards. However, Spiritomb's support movepool is impressive as well, and moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Trick can cripple an unsuspecting opponent. With dual base 92 offensive stats, he can even function as a mixed sweeper, albeit much weaker than the likes of Cacturne and Octillery.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/634.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><a href="/bw/pokemon/eelektross">Eelektross</a></h4>
<p>85 / <strong>115</strong> / 80 / <strong>105</strong> / 80 / <strong>50</strong></p>

<p>With pure Electric typing and Levitate, Eelektross also boasts a complete lack of weaknesses. Unlike Spiritomb, Eelektross's base 115 Attack and base 105 Special Attack are perfectly suited for mixed sweeping under Trick Room. His special movepool is quite extensive, and STAB Wild Charge is a great physical attack. His bulk is also quite solid, making him rather easy to switch in. Furthermore, access to U-turn and STAB Volt Switch allows him keep up offensive momentum and easily switch back to a Trick Room user as the timer runs out.</p>

<h2><a name="team">Team Building:</a></h2>

<p>When building a Trick Room team, the first Pokemon you must look for are obviously those that learn the move. A good Trick Room core should have 3 or 4 users of the move; if you have just one and it goes down, your entire team will fall apart. Your core should be capable of setting up Trick Room against as many different opponents as possible, so type variety must be stressed. Just because most of the Trick Room users are Psychic-types doesn't mean your entire core should be. Mix it up a bit. You'll also want your core members to be as bulky as possible; they'll be doing quite a bit of switching and constantly taking hits while setting up Trick Room. Finally, as Trick Room is a highly offensive playstyle, it is important that at least some members of your core maintain an offensive presence of their own.</p>

<p>Now for the fun part! Trick Room abusers need to have raw offensive presence, as they will not have enough time to set up and sweep before Trick Room runs out. Their Speed must also be as low as possible to ensure they will be "faster" than any opponents under Trick Room. As they will most likely be switching multiple times, and will be pitifully slow outside of Trick Room, good bulk and resistances are especially crucial for these sweepers. Priority attacks are a gigantic boon, as it allows them to pick off weakened foes outside of their preferred condition. Finally, Substitute is valuable move to keep them safe from status and ensure they can continue dishing out hits after Trick Room has disappeared.</p>

<p>Almost every Pokemon on a Trick Room team should be running -Speed natures and 0 Speed IVs and EVs, with a few notable exceptions. Sweepers that rely on certain Hidden Powers for coverage will prefer Speed IVs, so that Hidden Power's Base Power remains at 70. The way to find the spread in the Pokemon Online teambuilder is to first bump the Speed IV down to 2. Then, select the Hidden Power you want, and the client will automatically set the other IVs to the correct number. Trick Room users with access to U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass may opt for more Speed, so that they will be "slower" in Trick Room, allowing them to take a hit and switch a sweeper in freely. Finally, it can be useful to run an extremely fast cleaner, such as Choice Scarf Emboar, to finish off an opposing team outside of Trick Room.</p>

<h2><a name="solo">Solo Sweepers vs Teams</a></h2>

Some Pokemon, such as Gallade, Cofagrigus, and Beheeyem, have the ability to set up Trick Room and immediately present themselves as threats. Thanks to the pseudo-Speed boost from Trick Room, they can outspeed almost anything and make a clean sweep of a team. Though they can function on non-Trick Room teams as standalone sweepers, if they get phazed out or KOed, your team may find itself at a sudden disadvantage. For that reason, battlers usually prefer to run a full team based around the Trick Room condition.

<h2><a name="team">Example Team</a></h2>

<p>Provided by <a href="/forums/member.php?u=99727">Molk</a>:</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/235.png" alt="" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/smeargle">Smeargle</a> @ Focus Sash<br />
Ability: Own Tempo<br />
EVs: <br />
IVs: <br />
Nature: Hardy<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Spore<br />
- Endeavor<br />
- Dragon Rage</p>

<p>Molk's usual lead is a suicide Smeargle at Level 1. It is able to instantly gain momentum for his team, as it can set up Trick Room while surviving with Focus Sash and proceed to fire off a fast Spore or Endeavor to cripple an opponent. Dragon Rage always deals 40 damage to the opponent, meaning it can finish off anything after an Endeavor. Should the opponent go for a Taunt right away, he has the option of using Endeavor first turn and Dragon Rage on the second, still surviving with 1 HP and eliminating an opposing Pokemon.</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/199.png" alt="" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/slowking">Slowking</a> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Regenerator<br />
EVs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Nature: Quiet (+SpA, -Spe)<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Surf<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Fire Blast</p>

<p>Slowking is a valuable member of Molk's main Trick Room core. With good bulk and typing, it can set up Trick Room several times, and even heal up on the switch thanks to Regenerator. It also has an impressive offensive presence of its own, with Surf, Psychic, and Fire Blast offering great coverage for a powerful special sweeper.</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/593.png" alt="" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/cofagrigus">Cofagrigus</a> @ Leftovers<br />
Ability: Mummy<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD<br />
IVs: 2 Spe<br />
Nature: Quiet (+SpA, -Spe)<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Nasty Plot<br />
- Shadow Ball<br />
- Hidden Power Fighting</p>

<p>Another member of Molk's Trick Room core, Cofagrigus is a great bulky setter. It carries Nasty Plot to set up prior to using Trick Room, and it is able to rip into the opponent with perfect coverage. It perfectly fits the role of Trick Room user and sweeper in just one Pokemon.</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/306.png" alt="" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/aggron">Aggron</a> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Rock Head<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Nature: Brave (+Atk, -Spe)<br />
- Head Smash<br />
- Earthquake<br />
- Ice Punch<br />
- Aqua Tail</p>

<p>Aggron is a much needed Dark resist for Molk's team. With STAB Head Smash and a Choice Band equipped, even Pokemon that resist its main attack will be maimed. Earthquake, Ice Punch, and Aqua Tail provide solid coverage alongside Head Smash. Since Aggron will rarely be sticking around for more than 3 turns, it has little to fear from being locked into a move.</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/651.png" alt="" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/druddigon">Druddigon</a> @ Choice Band<br />
Ability: Rough Skin<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Nature: Brave (+Atk, -Spe)<br />
- Outrage<br />
- Sucker Punch<br />
- Superpower<br />
- Dragon Claw</p>

<p>Druddigon is yet another bulky Choice Band user on this team. With STAB Outrage, it can easily break through anything that isn't a Steel-type, and even some Pokemon that are. Superpower is a great option for dealing with said Steel-types, and Dragon Claw lacks the drawback of possibly confusing Druddigon or locking him into Outrage for longer than desired. Finally, Sucker Punch offers welcomed priority for his team.</p>


<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/486.png" alt="" /><br />
<a href="/bw/pokemon/mesprit">Mesprit</a> @ Life Orb<br />
Ability: Levitate<br />
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA<br />
IVs: 0 Spe<br />
Nature: Quiet (+SpA, -Spe)<br />
- Trick Room<br />
- Psychic<br />
- Thunderbolt<br />
- Healing Wish</p>

<p>A late game Trick Room setter, Mesprit is arguably the key to Molk's success. While it has a good offensive presence of its own, it is Healing Wish that makes Mesprit so useful. After setting up Trick Room, it can use Healing Wish to bring back a worn down Aggron or Druddigon for a second, and often final, sweep of the opponent's team.</p>

<p>This team highlights the pure offensive nature of Trick Room. Right from the onset, Smeargle is able to set up Trick Room and start dismantling the opponent. Slowking and Cofagrigus work together to keep Trick Room on the field and constant pressure on the opponent, while Aggron can cover up their shared Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses. With a Choice Band attached, Druddigon and Aggron maximize their damage output and punch holes in any team. Mesprit allows them to capitalize on their softened opponents by giving them a second shot at a sweep. At all times, his team has a brutal combination of offense and defense to keep the opponent on their toes.</p>

<h2><a name="conc">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>Trick Room is a potent strategy that counters almost any other playstyle in the metagame. Its hyper aggression with powerful sweepers is easy to pick up, as well. The real key is putting together a good defensive core of setters and an offensive core of abusers. There are plenty of other slow, bulky sweepers in the tier, so get creative. And don't forget to have fun while you're sweeping your next opponent with a Clamperl.</p>
