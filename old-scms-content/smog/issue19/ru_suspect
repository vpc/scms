<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The RU tier, despite having been created less than a year ago,  has quickly settled itself in among Smogon. As the tier grew, certain  Pokemon rose to above the others, were deemed to be too much for the  tier, and were banished from it for good. The tier has continued to move  towards balance; with the tiering shifts in January, several new  Pokemon were dropped down, and suspect testing began its final push  towards making the RU tier completely balanced. This article will  analyze the most recent tiering decisions, and the impact that some  suspects had upon the metagame.</p>

<h2>NP: Stage Four</h2>

<p>The fourth round of suspect testing began on the heels of one  of the closest votes among suspects at that point: a 3-4 decision that  saw Porygon-Z narrowly remain RU. Honchkrow had already been decided to  be an automatic suspect, thanks to the results of its previous test and  the outcry against it from many members of the tier. Hail was also  prominent, with the feared ENDTRAILS (Endeavor + Trick Room + Hail)  strategy running rampant at the time. Two weeks into the round, however,  tiering shifts occurred, bringing down several Pokemon from UU, namely  Cresselia, Sigilyph, Whimsicott, Golurk, Spiritomb and Aerodactyl, with  RU losing only Krookodile in return. Hail was suddenly taken from RU  mid-round as well, due to Snow Warning being banned from UU. Amidst the  chaos, however, there was a Pokemon that rose to join Honchkrow and  Porygon-Z among the pantheon of suspects, and the results would come to  define RU as a tier.</p>

<p>When Cresselia entered the tier, there was an enormous outcry  from players who had been a part of the tier way back when RU was still a  lawless territory. Back then, Cresselia had helped define the tier, and  had gone so far as to have been put to a vote. The common consensus was  that it should be banned, but it flew off to UU before a verdict could  be rendered. It was amidst this prejudice that Cresselia rejoined the  throng, with many users calling for a quickban, or at the very least, a  mid-round vote. Sporting three brilliant sets in SubCM, a catch-all  defensive set, and dual screen support, players began to resort to using  multiple Dark-types on a team in order to stop it, CroTomb and  specially defensive Drapion being stalwarts at this time. Despite the  large amount of hate Cresselia received, there was a smaller, but very  vocal group of players orating against not only a quickban, but against  Cresselia even being considered a suspect! Citing a lack of initial  power, susceptibility to Toxic, and the frequency with which Cresselia  became setup fodder, their arguments gained traction against the pro-ban  majority. Among these mentalities, Cresselia was put to a mid-round  vote, where it was decided that it would remain in the tier for the  entirety of the suspect round. Interestingly, with a full round with  which to play with Cresselia, the SubCM set was discarded as an  effective competitive set, as Uxie performed the role more effectively.  Despite this setback, both sides became louder and louder in their  opinions, with the pro-ban side screaming about Cresselia’s insane  walling capabilities and amazing support options, including Thunder  Wave, dual screens, and Lunar Dance, and the anti-ban proponents raved  about the fact that Cresselia was 2HKOed by powerful attackers, and that  “no one was using Cresselia anyway, so how could it be broken?” These  arguments were thrown back with comments that Cresselia was not 2HKOed  by any unboosted attacker, and that the support set made Pokemon like  Porygon-Z absolutely devastating. Further still, the defensive set  invalidated balanced teams, as such a type of team containing at best  one Pokemon that could power through Cresselia, a Pokemon that would get  paralyzed in the process. As anti-ban members fought back with  arguments about how Cresselia was very similar to Uxie, and Uxie isn’t  broken, voting wrapped up, and the most hotly contested suspect to date  was narrowly banned by a final vote of 5-4. Both times it was in the  tier, Cresselia proved to be a polarizing force, shaping the way RU has  evolved. With Cresselia out of the way, the metagame became ready to  mould itself into what it would soon become.</p>

<p>Honchkrow has historically been a dominating force in RU,  beginning its career as a solid check to Venemoth, before settling into  the tier as a deadly sweeper, using its SubRoost set and excellent  ability, Moxie, to power through opponents with brutally powerful Brave  Birds and Sucker Punches. At one time it was heralded as a broken force,  although it remained in the tier after its Round 2 vote. By the time it  reached Round 4, however, the popular opinion had overwhelmingly  shifted to not broken. As people played against it, more and more checks  and counters emerged as means with which to deal with Honchkrow,  including Substitute, Trick, Aggron, Regirock, the general  predictability of Honchkrow and others. This was also the period where  Stunfisk became useful in RU, as a hard counter to Honchkrow. Although  the mixed version of Honchkrow could often beat its ordinary checks,  such as Rhydon and Steelix, with Hidden Power Grass and Heat Wave  respectively, this version of Honchkrow was quickly identified, and  lacked the ability to sweep you straight that the SubRoost version had.  At the end of the round, Honchkrow had received only limited support as a  broken Pokemon, and was unanimously voted to remain RU.</p>

<p>Porygon-Z was another Pokemon that had previously been voted  on; its vote coming at the conclusion of Round 3, where it was  determined to be RU. With another round of playing with it in the books,  opinions had shifted, thanks to the large number of sets it could run.  Porygon-Z had four major sets in Choice Scarf, Nasty Plot, Agility, and  Choice Specs, the latter being the primary culprit of ban arguments.  While the two Speed-boosting sets had issues with either settting up  safely or being outclassed, and the Nasty Plot set had initial power  issues&mdash;albeit destroying any slower Pokemon, and especially  stall when it was set up&mdash;the Choice Specs set was devastating.  With a Download boost, something that was fairly easy to accomplish  given the lack of special walls in the tier, Choice Specs Porygon-Z was  capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing every single Pokemon in the tier except  Munchlax and specially defensive Spiritomb. Furthermore, its base 90  Speed was the breakline for speedy Pokemon in the tier, meaning that  Porygon-Z outsped a good portion of the tier on its own merit. Despite  initial sentiment against banning it, public opinion quickly and  overwhelmingly grew against Porygon-Z’s presence in the tier, and it was  unanimously banned.</p>

<h2>NP: Stage Five</h2>

<p>With the metagame-defining decisions reached in the previous  suspect round, round 5 was looking to be a very enjoyable one to play,  with the consensus being that we were nearing a balanced metagame.  Sigilyph was an early target for suspect searchers, as its Cosmic Power  and Calm Mind sets tore apart some previously common teams. This idea  was quickly shot down, however: several comfortable methods of dealing  with it were proposed and subsequently proved to be more than effective,  and Sigilyph usage began to plummet. Using the previous Trick Room  strategy, ENDTRAILS, Trick Room began receiving more hype, and remained a  prominent fixture during the round, with threats such as Choice Band  Aggron, and Trick Room + Nasty Plot Cofagrigus defining the strategy. As  the round went on, Durant gained momentum as a top threat, building  from its ability to check Cresselia to becoming a dominant physical  force with its Hone Claws and Choice Band sets. Despite being a presence  in RU since the beginning, Sharpedo received some hype late in the  round. The eventual suspects were the well-deserved Durant and the  questionable Sharpedo.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/662.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Durant had a slow start to its RU tenure, only gaining  credibility during Round 4, where it was used to great effect when its  main checks dropped in usage with the new drop-downs after the tier  shifts. In Round 5, it found itself thrust into the spotlight, as people  began to realize that 109 Attack and 109 Speed with Hone Claws or a  Choice Band and a Hustle boost under its belt meant that Durant hit  incredibly hard. Its great defensive typing and good Defense stat served  to offset its terrible HP and Special Defense stat, allowing it to come  into battle multiple times in a game, wearing down its meager list of  counters. With only one complete counter in Steelix, Durant began to  demonstrate its power, as its list of defensive checks was not only  short, but also tailored to stall or particularly defensive balanced  teams. Durant’s excellent Speed stat also made it very difficult to  outspeed without resorting to a Choice Scarf user, one that would  usually have to be a special attacker. Although several users were  vehemently opposed to a ban, citing the multiple means of checking it,  the counter-arguments of incredible power and ability to beat its own  checks held strong, and Durant was eventually banished from  RU.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/319.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sharpedo was one of the most controversial suspects, not  because of the outcry it caused, but by the outcry it didn’t cause. By  most accounts, Sharpedo was not worthy of suspect status, due to the  lack of impact it had on the metagame despite receiving consistent usage  since RU was first created. By the time suspect time rolled around, it  was thrown in as a suspect due to its Speed Boost ability and thus, its  inability to be revenged by Choice Scarf users. Sharpedo is able to run  two main sets, a physical set, and the commonly agreed better choice,  MixPedo, which 2HKOes most of the tier. Although Sharpedo was able to  take down a good portion of the tier, the fact remained that if  something was able to survive a hit from it, which a decent amount of  the tier could accomplish, the return attack would almost surely be an  OHKO due to Sharpedo’s horrific defenses. Furthermore, Sharpedo has two  hard counters in Poliwrath and Ferroseed, the former being an option for  offense and balance teams whereas the latter fits in on balance and  stall. Worsening Sharpedo’s case even further is its susceptibility to  priority attacks, with many common priority users (7 of the top 50 in  RU, as well as the rising Linoone) able to OHKO it without even having  to suffer a hit. With these factors going against it, Sharpedo was  quickly deemed to be not broken, with only meager resistance to the  case.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the conclusion of the fifth round of suspect testing, the  general consensus is that a state of balance has been reached in the  metagame. Suspect testing has served its position admirably, and it  seems almost poetic for it to ride off into the sunset in favor of a  static tiering council just as the tier reaches equilibrium. With the  only likely suspects to come to be influenced by tiering shifts and with  suspect decisions to be reached based on community feelings, RU is set  to achieve greater heights than ever before, as the tier reaches greater  a prominence in the minds of the players.</p>
