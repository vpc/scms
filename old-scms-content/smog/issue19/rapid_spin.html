<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin is a rather poorly distributed move, but when used correctly, it can definitely be gamebreaking. Removing hazards is extremely important for some teams, as threats such as Ho-Oh, Dragonite, and Volcarona function much better without Stealth Rock up. Stall teams also appreciate Rapid Spin support, as it allows them to maintain the hazard advantage against opposing stall teams, greatly increasing their chances of winning. In this article, we'll go over some of the best Rapid Spinners for each tier.</p>

<h2>OU</h2>

<p>Spinning in OU can sometimes be tough, as there are two very good spinblockers in the tier. Jellicent has an excellent typing that complements its good bulk and movepool, which includes an instant recovery move in Recover. Taking it down with a defensively inclined spinner can be near-impossible. Gengar, on the other hand, is much more offensively inclined. With a base 130 Special Attack, it can threaten every Rapid Spinner with its powerful attacks. However, this comes at the cost of a lot of bulk, and it therefore has problems switching in, as a powerful attack might take it down. Spinning is sometimes absolutely necessary, however, as it maximizes the full potential of major threats such as Dragonite and Volcarona. Without Multiscale, Dragonite becomes much less threatening, and the same goes for Volcarona without half of its health. When using one of these Pok&eacute;mon, using a Rapid Spinner is almost a necessity.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/121.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Starmie is the most popular Rapid Spinner, and for good reason. With excellent base 115 Speed, above-average base 100 Special Attack, and excellent coverage with a STAB move and BoltBeam, it is able to threaten both of the common spinblockers. Gengar is outsped and taken down with a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump, while Jellicent is taken down with two Thunderbolts. With a Life Orb, three attacks, and Rapid Spin in the last slot, Starmie is almost guaranteed to get the spin off. The reason for this is that Life Orb Starmie has very few reliable switch-ins, and they all share one thing: they can't block Rapid Spin. Note that this Starmie will be easily worn down, and also can't threaten Ferrothorn—the most common Spiker in OU—and gets OHKOed in return.</p>

<p>Starmie can also opt to use Recover instead of Ice Beam. That way, Starmie's survivability increases greatly, at the cost of a precious coverage move. This option is best used if spinning away entry hazards is more important than a chance at sweeping with Starmie. Leftovers is an option over Life Orb to improve Starmie's survivability even further, but it comes at the cost of not being able to 2HKO Jellicent with Thunderbolt. However, this can be fixed by using Thunder if Starmie is on a rain team.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/73.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tentacruel is an excellent support Pok&eacute;mon, as it is great at controlling hazards for defensive teams with both Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin. Rain stall especially appreciates the support Tentacruel can give, and Rain Dish lets Tentacruel restore 12.5% every turn factoring in Leftovers. Add to that a neat typing, and Tentacruel gets many opportunities to set up or spin. Its part Poison typing also lets it absorb Toxic Spikes upon switching in, which is immensely helpful to Pok&eacute;mon who dislike Toxic Spikes, such as Chansey and Blissey.</p> 

<p>However, being walled by both the most common spinblocker and the most common Spiker really limits Tentacruel's potential. Therefore, a set has recently been developed that enables Tentacruel to get around both Ferrothorn and Jellicent. With Substitute, Tentacruel becomes immune to Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, as well as Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp. The health loss isn't too big of a problem, as Rain Dish quickly heals Tentacruel back to top shape. Scald and Toxic can then take care of Ferrothorn and Jellicent; Ferrothorn will eventually be burned, while Jellicent succumbs to Toxic, as it is walled by Tentacruel, as opposed to the other way around.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/205.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Forretress can be described in two words: "hazard control". With access to all three entry hazards and Rapid Spin, Forretress can fill all your hazard-related needs. Need something to use Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Rapid Spin? Forretress can do it. It also gets enough opportunities to either set up hazards or spin them away thanks to its solid base 140 Defense and great defensive typing. Forretress also has Sturdy, which can be useful if you need an emergency hazard or an emergency spin. Forretress can use both a physically defensive and a specially defensive EV spread effectively. On one hand, a physically defensive spread lets Forretress tank physical hits much more easily, allowing it to comfortably set up on physical attackers. On the other hand, a specially defensive spread is more focused on utilizing Forretress's excellent typing and resistances, letting Forretress set up on the likes of Choice Specs Latios.</p>

<h2>Uber</h2>

<p>Spinning in Ubers is no easy task, with defensive behemoths, such as the Giratina formes and Ghost Arceus, being almost unbreakable by the tier's common spinners. However, there exist tools that they can employ to penetrate these monstrous bulkwarks, and trust me, it is well worth it. With Stealth Rock off the field, offensive juggernauts such as Rayquaza and Ho-Oh can switch in at no cost, and Lugia performs its walling duties much more easily. Grounded Pok&eacute;mon will also enjoy the removal of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, allowing defensive Pok&eacute;mon such as Giratina-A and Chansey to do their job much better, and letting extremely deadly Pok&eacute;mon such as the various Calm Mind Arceus formes to sweep without being placed on a death timer.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/205.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are really only three viable spinners in Ubers: Forretress, Tentacruel, and Excadrill. One will find that Forretress is the most common choice, as it also has access to all forms of entry hazards, a single weakness, and a plethora of useful resistances. However, outside of Toxic and the newly nerfed Payback, which won't be doing much at all, Forretress really can't threaten any of the tier's common spinblockers. Forretress is also hindered by the fact that Dialga, the most common user of Stealth Rock in the Ubers tier, can OHKO it with a 4x super effective Fire Blast if Sturdy isn't active. Forretress also has some interesting options insofar as its curiously expansive movepool goes; a moveset of Pain Split / Toxic / Toxic Spikes or Spikes / Rapid Spin can be employed. This allows the brave bag worm to stand up to the mighty Extreme Killer Arceus, and beat most variants of Giratina-O in the rain, courtesy of Giratina-O's massive base 150 HP.</p> 

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/73.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tentacruel has only improved in the transition between generations; with its new Dream World ability, Rain Dish, it can now recover a substantial 12.5% HP per turn in conjunction with Leftovers. Furthermore, Tentacruel also acquired the ever-annoying Scald, with the burn chance somewhat alleviating its sub par physical defense. Unlike Forretress, Tentacruel actually enjoys being out against Dialga, as none of its common moves will do much damage. This lets Tentacruel happily sit there and lay down Toxic Spikes or spin away Dialga's Stealth Rock. Tentacruel does have its drawbacks though. It possesses a measly base 65 Defense, which will often see minimal investment, as Ubers requires a fully specially defensive set. Tentacruel's problems with physical attacks is only compounded by its weakness to the ubiquitous Earthquake, as well as Zekrom's Bolt Strike. Tentacruel has a workable base 80 Special Attack, which allows its Ice Beam to 3HKO Giratina-O. However, don't expect it to do much against Giratina-A. One must be careful against the tier's other premier spinblocker, Ghost-Arceus, as Calm Mind variants can step in on Tentacruel when it has only one layer of Toxic Spikes up. Arceus can then threaten a sweep, as regular poison grants it an immunity to more crippling status, meaning that Blissey and Chansey cannot hinder it with Toxic or Thunder Wave. The premier offensive CM Arceus check, Darkrai, cannot even check Ghost Arceus with Dark Void in this situation, and will fall to a +1 Focus Blast, while Arceus survives an unboosted Dark Pulse in return.</p>

<div class="floatright"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue19/rapidspin_excadrill.png" alt="" /></div>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/558.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Previously the sand demon that dominated OU, Excadrill has now risen to the Uber tier to become the only spinner that can get past Giratina-A—and even then it needs a lot of hazards or some pretty good luck... Excadrill runs a very effective bulky spinner set that is an amazing asset for balanced and defensive rain teams looking for a wallbreaker or a spinner. With investment in its oft-overlooked base 110 HP stat and seemingly mediocre base 65 Special Defense stat, Excadrill becomes quite bulky on the special side. With the right EVs and rain support, Excadrill is capable of walling and eventually beating Giratina-O—provided it isn't carrying the rare Earthquake or Will-O-Wisp—by utilizing Swords Dance and Shadow Claw. Excadrill is also immune to Toxic and Thunder Wave, making it a fabulous switch in to Chansey and Blissey. Excadrill can also be run effectively on sand teams, a set reminiscent of its time in OU. With its base 88 Speed doubled under sandstorm, none of the common Ubers Choice Scarfers can revenge kill it, making it the best offensive spinner in the game bar none. Excadrill isn't perfect though, as Sand is harder to keep up in Ubers, and with the omnipotence of Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza, Excadrill may find its sweep cut short. Groudon also happens to be one of Excadrill's biggest nemeses. Thanks to Drought, all Groudon has to do is switch in, as the sun strips Excadrill of its Speed and amplifies its Fire weakness. Groudon also takes meagre damage from Excadrill's attacks and can OHKO in return with STAB Earthquake.</p>

<h2>UU</h2>

<p>UU isn't as permeated with spinners as it is with Spikers, but then again, Rapid Spinners are a luxury in most tiers. With Donphan sadly gone, UU teams look to two main spinners: Hitmontop and Blastoise. Honorable mentions go to Kabutops, who makes a great offensive spinner, especially on rain teams, as well as Cryogonal, who has fantastic Special Defense and reliable recovery. While the former two are usually better choices, they're by no means bad, and you should definitely try them out if you want to put a new spin on things! Both Hitmontop and Blastoise are great spinners, and even have access to Foresight, but have some distinct differences. Although UU does lack great entry hazard controllers, it is by no means low on entry hazards; some might say the tier is focused on them. This is because there's such an influx of great Spikers, with Froslass, Roserade, and Deoxys-D being the big 3. These Pok&eacute;mon are incredibly efficient at setting up Spikes, and can make your opponent's life hell if they aren't prepared to deal with them. These great Spikers really put an emphasis on the importance of Rapid Spin in UU.</p>

<p>Spinblockers have it nice in UU, compared to the spinblockers of OU—Jellicent and Gengar—who both have a hard time against Starmie. Mismagius and Chandelure can switch in against Hitmontop and set up with Substitute and Calm Mind / Nasty Plot like there's no tomorrow. As for Dusclops, it just sits on ass its all day, but it has Will-O-Wisp, so it's not all bad. With so many great spinblockers and spikers available in UU, it's easy to see how the spikestacking strategy can be overwhelming and frustrating. Some people don't realize that Foresight is an incredibly useful move, letting you bypass your opponents spinblocker. This will usually come at the cost of being crippled by Will-O-Wisp or being set up against, but there's always the option of a cleric, and Snorlax can phaze any Ghost-type, even after a few Special Attack boosts. Pursuiters are also an option. Krookodile makes a fine choice, as is Heracross, who can bypass Will-O-Wisp and gain an Attack boost thanks to Guts.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/237.png" alt="" /></p>
 
<p>Hitmontop has always been a star in UU, although its role has changed somewhat. In early UU, it played a more offensive role with Technician and a variety of priority attacks, but now it is primarily used as a bulky Rapid Spinner. Hitmontop has Intimidate, giving it the ability to repeatedly switch into physical attackers, although it'll get worn down without Wish support. Rhyperior is a good example of a Pok&eacute;mon that Hitmontop likes to switch into, as it can lower Rhyperior's Attack and threaten to get rid of the Stealth Rock, while simultaneously forcing it out with STAB Close Combat. The only problem, and it is an important one, is that Hitmontop is pretty much useless when it comes face-to-face with any Ghost-type. It can always do its job thanks to Foresight, but Hitmontop will still get set up on by Substitute and the Ghost-type's boosting move, or crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Hitmontop should always run Stone Edge for Chandelure, mitigates its problem against Ghost-types. There are two main spinblockers in UU, Chandelure and Mismagius, and with Stone Edge, Hitmontop has a 40% chance of beating your opponent's Ghost-type, since most people tend to run only one Ghost. Blastoise doesn't have as much trouble with Ghost-types, but if you want a reliable spinner that makes a solid switch-in to Pok&eacute;mon such Heracross, then look no further! Also, look at his penis, it's almost as big as his legs.</p>

<div class="floatright"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue19/rapidspin_blastoise.png" alt="" /></div>
<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The giant turtle is also a solid choice for a spinner. While it doesn't have a great ability in Intimidate like Hitmontop, or the ability to switch into the mighty Heracross, it is a bulky Water-type, "nuff said". Yeah, it's that simple; Blastoise's typing is a huge plus when deciding on a spinner for your team. Bulky Water-types are very crucial in UU, and can fit nicely onto any team. The fact that with Blastoise, you have a spinner and a bulky Water-type rolled into one Pok&eacute;mon, is invaluable. Like Hitmontop, Blastoise can use Foresight, meaning it can always pull off a Rapid Spin. However, Foresight faces serious competition for a moveslot, and with moves such as Scald, Ice Beam, and Roar in Blastoise's arsenal, it might not always make the cut. Blastoise also fares better against the Ghost-types of UU; Chandelure will usually avoid the turtle for fear of being hit by a nasty Scald, and Blastoise can take a few hits from Mismagius and retaliate with Scald; it also can't set up against Blastoise because Scald will break its Substitutes. Blastoise is an excellent Pok&eacute;mon, and can work on any kind of team. Basically, if your team is weak to entry hazards, then you can replace your bulky Water-type with Blastoise and be on your merry way! Blastoise could have a big penis too, since he's a giant turtle, but Hitmontop wins the battle for now...</p>

<h2>RU</h2>

<p>With most of the stars of the Rapid Spinning world off to the big cities of OU and UU, the remaining Rapid Spinners are left with an important job to handle in RU. Stealth Rock is an omnipresent force as usual, keeping threats such as Entei and powerful Flying-type attackers in check, and Spikes is another powerful force, so spinning becomes crucial. The ease with which entry hazards can be set up makes spinning even more important; Aerodactyl and Uxie can easily lay Stealth Rock, while Accelgor and Scolipede outspeed most of the tier and can easily set up multiple layers of Spikes. Qwilfish and Drapion are also dangerous: both have plenty of bulk, as well as good defensive typing that allows them to set up Spikes and/or Toxic Spikes. The number of viable Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon does nothing for the peace of mind of common Rapid Spinners, particularly Dusknoir and Cofagrigus, both of which are very difficult for spinners to get past due to their immense bulk and offensive presence. While these Pok&eacute;mon are more frequently seen on defensive teams, offensive teams still have a spinblocker of their own in Rotom, who can temporarily stop most Rapid Spinners without difficulty. Rapid Spinners in RU, although not overly present, are therefore crucial—Pok&eacute;mon such as Hitmonlee are often willing to sacrifice a coverage move on offensive teams just to remove entry hazards from their side.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/107.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hitmonchan has traditionally been the least used of the fighting trio, and has always been outclassed in some form, but in RU, Hitmonchan dominates the usage stats with its access to Rapid Spin, solid bulk, and Mach Punch. Mach Punch is perhaps the biggest boon Hitmonchan has going for it, being crucial in revenge killing some of RU's key threats in Sharpedo and Omastar. In addition to being able to recover health with Drain Punch, Hitmonchan also has excellent special bulk, which allows it to combat specially oriented threats such as Accelgor and Sceptile. As such, Rapid Spinning comes naturally to Hitmonchan. Its ability to do so is greatly improved with access to Foresight, which ensures that no spinblocker is capable of stopping its spin. Indeed, the only spinblocker that can completely take advantage of Hitmonchan is Cofagrigus, who can set up both Trick Room and Nasty Plot while Hitmonchan spins the entry hazards, while caring little for any attack Hitmonchan will aim at it. Hitmonchan can also perform an offensive set quite well, with Close Combat and ice Punch providing excellent coverage and power. With its unparalleled ability to guarantee Rapid Spin, as well as its ability to check crucial threats in the metagame, Hitmonchan is without a doubt the most solid choice for Rapid Spinning.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/645.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cryogonal is the most natural Rapid Spinner available, as immunities to Spikes and Toxic Spikes grant it safety when switching in. Although it does suffer from a Stealth Rock weakness, Cryogonal can easily Recover off that damage after spinning away opposing hazards. Getting off a spin is no problem either due to Cryogonal's excellent base 105 Speed stat, which allows it to outspeed a good portion of RU. Furthermore, Cryogonal can defeat most spinblockers under varying circumstances thanks to a combination of excellent special bulk, a fast Toxic, and a powerful Ice Beam that will usually 2HKO Rotom. Unfortunately, Cryogonal's Ice typing cripples it defensively, and along with its terrible Defense, makes it somewhat difficult to keep around. That being said, Cryogonal's ability to support its team is huge, thanks to its ability to provide dual screens, its access to Haze, which nullifies opposing stat boosting attempts, as well as the ease with which it can spin away hazards. Able to fit in on balanced, stall, or offensive team styles, Cryogonal should always come to mind when considering a Rapid Spinner.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/344.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Claydol was once the gold standard of Rapid Spinning in RU, with its excellent defensive typing and Levitate ability, as well as solid defensive stats, which served it well in checking opposing physical threats. Furthermore, it was one of the few Rapid Spinners that were also capable of laying entry hazards, Stealth Rock in Claydol's case. Claydol also had a ridiculously varied support movepool including Trick, dual screens, and Magic Coat, which all served to confound the opponent. Unfortunately, RU quickly shifted towards bulky attacking and Substitute setup, neither of which boded well for Claydol. At the same time, a power creep and shift towards offense occurred, making it very difficult for Claydol to wall the threats it used to. The biggest nail in Claydol's coffin, however, was the advance of Ghost-type Pok&eacute;mon in RU. Starting with Rotom, and continuing with Dusknoir and Cofagrigus, Claydol consistently found itself confronted by Pok&eacute;mon that would prevent it from Rapid Spinning, and that Claydol could not break through. Despite these downfalls, and a metagame unfriendly to it, the combination of Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and great defensive typing is almost always a boon, and can only serve Claydol well in its attempts to support its team.</p>

<h2>NU</h2>

<p>I should make one thing clear from the onset: spinning in NU sucks. As the higher tiers greedily snatch up anything decent with Rapid Spin, NU is left with nothing but the dregs. It remains a defining move in the metagame, however. Many of the best sweepers in the tier, including Swellow, Jynx, and Magmortar, suffer from a Stealth Rock weakness that can cut their sweep short. Unfortunately, Stealth Rock is just as common in NU as it is in any other tier, with popular Pok&eacute;mon such as Mesprit and Regirock consistently setting it up. Toxic Spikes is also prevalent, as Garbodor has little trouble putting them into play. This often spells disaster for some of the premier walls in the tier, as Lickilicky, Quagsire, and Regirock are all severely crippled by Toxic Spikes. Sadly, there are only four decent spinners in the tier; after that, you're forced to resort to the likes of Delibird and Spinda. To make matters worse, Misdreavus and Haunter are tough spinblockers to get around, and both can set up as a spinner flees.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/645.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cryogonal is hands down the best spinner in the tier. With a blazing fast base 105 Speed and a solid base 95 Special Attack, it is the only spinner that can consistently beat down the spinblockers of the tier. Ice Beam and Hidden Power Ground offer great coverage, allowing Cryogonal to threaten not only the spinblockers, but many of the common Stealth Rock and Spikes users as well. While a weakness to Stealth Rock is undesirable for a Rapid Spin user, Levitate at least keeps it safe from Spikes and Toxic Spikes (a feat that the other three spinners cannot boast). Although Cryogonal's special bulk is definitely noteworthy, its pure Ice typing isn't winning it any defensive awards. Thankfully, Cryogonal has access to Recover to help it stick around. It is also the only common spinner in the tier with reliable recovery, which makes it all the more desirable. It can even offer dual screens support to help beef up your entire team; the added defenses work wonders for Cryogonal as well. Undoubtedly NU's most versatile and threatening spinner, we can only hope its popularity in RU doesn't increase.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/348.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With an impressive base 125 Attack, Armaldo is the most powerful spinner in the tier. Flawless attack coverage with just its STABs and Earthquake allows it to scare away weaker foes and spin as they skoot off. Swords Dance is also an option for further boost its great Attack. Access to Stealth Rock means Armaldo can set up entry hazards of its own to boot. While its Speed is rather pathetic, it has several ways to alleviate that issue. Rock Polish increases its Speed, while also allowing Armaldo to maintain offensive momentum and spining as needed. With Swift Swim as its Dream World ability, Armaldo is the best choice for a Rapid Spin user on a rain team. Trick Room also fixes any Speed troubles, and its great Attack and poor Speed make it a perfect candidate as a Trick Room sweeper. Sadly, Armaldo is weak to every form of entry hazard, meaning if your opponent has already set them up, it will be severely weakened when it switches in to remove them. Spinblockers also often carry Will-O-Wisp, which greatly reduces its offensive presence, and Haunter's Shadow Ball has a chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/324.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Torkoal is the most physically bulky spinner in NU, making it a solid choice for stall teams. Yawn is a great trick to force out spinblockers, allowing it to spin as they switch back out. Just like Armaldo, Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock for your team as well. Lava Plume is also a handy move, as its decent burn rate greatly improves Torkoal's bulk. Sadly, as Ground- and Rock-type attacks are typical sights on physical attackers, that bulk isn't all its cracked up to be. With common Stealth Rock users such as Regirock and Golem often carrying these attacks, Stealth Rock can easily be set up once more as Torkoal withdraws in fear. Furthermore, a weakness to every type of entry hazard makes Torkoal's job as a Rapid Spin user very taxing for it. It also has no recovery outside of rest, which turns it into setup fodder without cleric support. Without hefty Special Defense investment, Haunter's Sludge Bomb always OHKOes after Stealth Rock, meaning Torkoal has no way of standing up against it. Frillish takes next to nothing from Lava Plume and has a faster Taunt to shut down Torkoal, allowing it to easily come out on top. Lava Plume does under 20% to Misdreavus, which can use Calm Mind and either Taunt or Substitute to set up on Torkoal.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thanks to Eviolite, Wartortle has the greatest mixed defenses of all the spinners in NU. Its reliance on Eviolite means it cannot utilize Leftovers, however, and a lack of any recovery move sans Rest means Wartortle is easily worn down. Though it is not weak to Stealth Rock like the other spinners on this list, Toxic Spikes wear Wartortle down faster than they do the others, due to the lack of Leftovers. Much like its turtle comrade Torkoal, Wartortle can use Yawn to force out Misdreavus or Haunter on the switch, allowing it to spin as they retreat. Haze is a great move for making sure Wartortle isn't pure setup bait, though a boosted sweeper can often just plow through it. Scald's decent burn rate can help Wartortle on the physical side, though it is offensively the weakest of the four and shouldn't be relied on for actual damage output. Seismic Toss is actually a good attacking option for it, as it deals a consistent 100 HP damage to foes, but it leaves Wartortle walled further by Ghosts. As it stands, there is nothing outside of Toxic that Wartortle can do to threaten Frillish, who is capable of using Toxic right back and outliving Wartortle thanks to Recover. Haunter can use Substitute to keep itself safe from Yawn and has Disable to shut down Scald, meaning it can effectively wall Wartortle as well. Misdreavus uses Wartortle as setup fodder, as its fast Taunt or Substitute blocks Haze and allows it to use Calm Mind without fear.</p>

<h2>LC</h2>

<p>Spinning in LC is tricky. Putting aside the recent reintroduction of Misdreavus—the be-all and end-all of Ghost-types—there are only a handful of LC eligible Pok&eacute;mon that learn Rapid Spin, and most of them... well, most of them suck. The only Pok&eacute;mon with the stats, typing, and movepool to use Rapid Spin effectively are Staryu and Drillbur. That's better than nothing, especially in a tier swimming in entry hazards thanks to the high usage of Gligar, Bronzor, Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Hippopotas. LC does appreciate its spinners though. Many of the threats in the metagame are weak to Stealth Rock, most notably Murkrow and Snover, but also a few underappreciated gems such as Houndour and Larvesta, and due to the bulky offensive nature of LC, getting hazards off the field can make or break quite a few games.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/120.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Staryu is the most common spinner in Little Cup, and it's definitely the best. It is the only spinner that has access to reliable recovery, and the fastest at 19 Speed (Sand Rush Drilbur and Sandshrew excluded). With Eviolite, it also gains respectable defenses, especially alongside the aforementioned Speed and recovery. Staryu also still poses a huge threat to many Pok&eacute;mon with above-average Special Attack and access to moves such as Hydro Pump, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Fire. As an added bonus, Staryu is able to switch in and wall many of the Pok&eacute;mon who commonly set up entry hazards, such as Dwebble, Hippopotas, and Bronzor, though it must be cautious around Ferroseed and Lileep. Common spinblockers are also wary to switch in, as Misdreavus has to risk speed ties against Staryu and generally can't OHKO it, while Frillish will be 2HKOed by Thunderbolt if it has taken any prior damage.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/557.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Drilbur doesn't commonly use Rapid Spin, but it is still one of the better spinners nonetheless, especially on offensive sandstorm teams. Drilbur functions similarly to how Excadrill did in OU and does in Ubers. It can very easily force a lot of Pok&eacute;mon out, and take advantage of that turn by using Rapid Spin instead of Swords Dance or another attack. Spinblockers will not enjoy switching in, as they can all be threatened by boosted Shadow Claws or Earthquakes. Drilbur does have a hard time coming in multiple times throughout a match though. Its pure Ground typing doesn't give it as many resistances as Excadrill, and without Leftovers or any recovery moves, it can get worn down very quickly. This means that the best way to play Drilbur is to use it on offensive teams, and spinning only once or twice as a surprise move when needed, because it's not going to get many more opportunities than that.</p>
