<p>Welcome to our latest iteration of trivia! While we have tried to prevent Pok&eacute;mon X and Y from eating our trivia-generating powers, the inevitable has inevitably happened. Apologies if this issue's trivia seems... well, drier than usual.</p>

<p>Let's cut short the paragraphs of small talk I could potentially make about the release of X and Y, though, and get down to the main purpose of this article. This time, let's congratulate Treecko on his triumphant effort in correctly solving 6 of the 10 non-bonus questions we posed last issue! Please claim your prize, a custom title, from any one of the... wait a minute, you have one already, don't you... let's just review last issue's answers, I guess.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Which Pok&eacute;mon have acquired a different / new typing after the generation in which they were introduced?</strong><br />
Magnemite, Magneton, Rotom-C, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Rotom-S, Rotom-F, Cleffa, Clefairy, Clefable, Togepi, Togetic, Togekiss, Snubbull, Granbull, Igglybuff, Jigglypuff, Wigglytuff, Mime Jr., Mr. Mime, Azurill, Marill, Azumarill, Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir, Mawile, Cottonee, and Whimsicott. Of course, if you answered before XY came out, we wouldn't have expected you to give most of the answers&mdash;only the first seven.</li>
<li><strong>Name 5 Trainer classes introduced in every generation.</strong><br />
I'm just going to throw <a href="bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trainer_class">this</a> page here.</li>
<li><strong>Name all the side games that were introduced alongside the main games in every generation.</strong><br />
Generation 1 brought with it Pok&eacute;mon Snap, Pok&eacute;mon TCG, Hey You, Pikachu!, Pok&eacute;mon Pinball, Pok&eacute;mon Puzzle League, and Pok&eacute;mon Pikachu; Generation 2 came alongside Pok&eacute;mon Stadium GS, Pok&eacute;mon TCG 2, Pok&eacute;mon Pikachu 2, and Puzzle Challenge; Generation 3 saw the arrival of Pok&eacute;mon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire, Pok&eacute;mon Channel, Pok&eacute;mon Box: Ruby &amp; Sapphire, Pok&eacute;mon Colosseum, Pok&eacute;mon XD: Gale of Darkness, Pok&eacute;mon Dash!, Pok&eacute;mon Trozei, Pok&eacute;mon Ranger, and of course, Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Red and Blue Rescue Team. More recently, Generation 4 introduced Pok&eacute;mon Battle Revolution, My Pok&eacute;mon Ranch, Pok&eacute;Park Wii, Pok&eacute;Walker, Pok&eacute;mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia, Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time &amp; Darkness, Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky, Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Blazing/Stormy/Light Adventure Squad, Pok&eacute;mon Rumble, and the lesser-known Pok&eacute;mon Battrio arcade game. Finally, Generation 5 brought us Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity, Pok&eacute;mon Rumble Blast, Pok&eacute;mon Rumble U, the obscure Pok&eacute;mon Tretta arcade game, the possibly even more obscure Pok&eacute;mon Medal World arcade game, Pok&eacute;mon Dream Radar, Pok&eacute;mon Conquest, and Pok&eacute;dex 3D Pro. Phew!</li>
<li><strong>What's the only Pok&eacute;mon that has received different patterns on its body? This is in the different main games as well as other media such as the manga and TCG, as per its Pok&eacute;dex entry.</strong><br />
Since Spinda technically always has the same polka-dot pattern, the only Pok&eacute;mon which fits the bill is Arbok.</li>
<li><strong>Despite the physical / special split in Gen IV, some Pok&eacute;mon from the Battle Frontier kept their movesets exactly the same. Name at least 3 of these Pok&eacute;mon.</strong><br />
To name a few, Starmie 4 (Surf / Psychic / Thunderbolt / Ice Beam), Lapras 4 (Surf / Ice Beam / Psychic / Thunderbolt), Heracross 4 (Megahorn / Earthquake / Reversal / Endure), Slowking 4 (Psychic / Surf / Ice Beam / Flamethrower), Vaporeon 1 (Surf / Ice Beam / Acid Armor / Baton Pass), Forretress 4 (Explosion / Double-Edge / Earthquake / Rock Slide), and Dewgong 3 (Sheer Cold / Horn Drill / Rest / Sleep Talk) were all repeats.</li>
<li><strong>Not including TMs and Key Items, name at least one item from each of the main games from Crystal onwards which could only be found once within its respective game.</strong><br />
There are (surprisingly or not) actually quite a few answers to this one! We've listed a few answers from each generation below, but keep in mind there are probably tons of different answers!<br />
<ul>
<li>GSC: Berserk Gene, Sacred Ash, Amulet Coin...</li>
<li>RS: BlackGlasses, Amulet Coin, DeepSeaScale, DeepSeaTooth, Macho Brace...</li>
<li>Emerald: Amulet Coin, DeepSeaScale, DeepSeaTooth, Soul Dew...</li>
<li>FRLG: Quick Claw, Amulet Coin, Lucky Punch, Smoke Ball...</li>
<li>DPPt: Big Root, Mental Herb, Amulet Coin, Old Gateau, any of the Plates...</li>
<li>HGSS: Light Clay, Amulet Coin, Soul Dew...</li>
<li>BW1: Shell Bell, Big Root, Amulet Coin, Eviolite, any of the Plates...</li>
<li>BW2: Destiny Knot, Big Root, Amulet Coin, any of the Plates...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Name a move released in Gen I whose type, effects, PP, Base Power, and accuracy have all remained unchanged since then.</strong><br />
Transform and Pound are two valid answers; there are probably more though!</li>
<li><strong>Name all of the Pokémon which have been OU for at least 4 generations in a row (in the interests of sanity, assume that if and only if a Pokémon is currently ranked OU in a generation, then it counts).</strong><br />
Gengar, Starmie, Zapdos, Blissey, Forretress, Jolteon, Skarmory, Tyranitar, Snorlax.</li>
<li><strong>Name 10 Pok&eacute;mon whose names are actual words recognized by the Oxford English Dictionary.</strong><br />
Abra, Oddish, Gloom, Haunter, Golem, Persian, Mew, Slaking, Ditto, Paras, Electrode, Magneton, and Slowpoke all work.</li>
<li><strong>How many different islands (i.e., landmasses separate from the mainland) have existed throughout the Pok&eacute;mon games?</strong><br />
42&mdash;Cinnabar Island, the two Seafoam Islands, the Trainer Tower, the Battle Tower, the four Whirl Islands, the nine Sevii Islands, Altering Cave, Hoenn's Battle Tower/Frontier, Ever Grande City, Sootopolis City, Mossdeep City, Dewford Town, the Sky Pillar, Shoal Cave, Mt. Pyre, Southern Island, Island Cave, Mirage Island, Far Away Island, Sinnoh's Battle Frontier, Newmoon Island, Fullmoon Island, Iron Island, Flower Paradise, Victory Road Island, Liberty Garden, Unity Tower, P2 Laboratory, and Unova's Route 18. Of course, this is highly debatable, but we've only included the major islands here.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bonus: What do the following have in common: Kangaskhan, Karate Chop, Drizzle?</strong><br />

The answer to this question is 2&mdash;Kangaskhan, Karate Chop, and Drizzle all took up an index number of 2 in their respective categories in the generations they were released. Only one entrant got this question correct, though. Let's congratulate AstralFire for his sharp and insightful mind! For your efforts, you have also earned yourself a custom title of your own. Ask any admin for your prize. On, then, to this issue's set of conundrums!</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Besides Pok&eacute;mon Bank, name a piece of extra in-game content which cost money to use and gave access to exclusive content.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Name a Pok&eacute;mon whose base happiness value is equal to its base catch rate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>How many smashable walls exist within XY?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is the only existing type + ability combination that can create a triple resistance to a Pok&eacute;mon type?</strong></li>
<li><strong>In how many different areas in XY can you ride Pok&eacute;mon during the game?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which Pok&eacute;mon can participate in a sky battle despite not being a Flying-type nor having the ability Levitate?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Name all the items that can affect the breeding process.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Of all the new Trainer classes (not including Battle Chateau classes), which one appears the most in XY?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which Pok&eacute;mon makes the most appearances in the overworld in XY?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Of all the egg groups named after types, which one excludes the most number of Pok&eacute;mon with that typing and how many such Pok&eacute;mon does it exclude? (Combine Water 1, Water 2 and Water 3 and treat them as a single egg group.)</strong></li>
</ol>
