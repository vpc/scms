<p>Welcome to the 11th iteration of Judge-A-Pok&eacute;mon, where our panel of artists and image admirers inspect official designs more closely and give their collected thoughts on the matter. The last months have been a tremendously active phase for the Pok&eacute;mon fanbase as more and more species for Gen VI are announced in a steady pace, and we at The Smog are no less aware of it. Therefore, five new designs for X &amp; Y has been selected and reviewed for this occasion, and it's up to our judges to decide for themselves whether these new official Pok&eacute;mon hold up to the standard or fail to do so. The panel this issue consists of Birkal, Bummer, Magistrum, SnowPeashooters, and ZapDraws, represented here by Rotom, Cacturne, Crobat, Chandelure, and Pikachu respectively.</p>

<h2>Awakened Mewtwo</h2>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_mewtwo-xy.png" alt="" /></div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker birkal">

<p>As a huge fan of the original 151 Pok&eacute;mon, the addition of a forme to one of the most iconic figures of Pok&eacute;mon has been rough on me. I admire that Nintendo is attempting to dig into their roots and pay homage to what is now a mostly forgotten era of Pok&eacute;mon, but this new forme just isn't sticking with me. Its head ring is too ornate for my tastes, and relocating the tail from its butt to the back of its head is confusing. There is speculation that this new forme might be a nod towards the new Fairy-type being introduced in Generation 6, which would correlate well with the new, cartoon-y feel of the Pok&eacute;mon. However, I don't feel that Awakened Mewtwo will make a splash as a fore-running design of Pok&eacute;mon XY. Its bland and uninspired design will likely cause it to fall to the wayside as other, more intriguing Pok&eacute;mon take the spotlight.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker bummer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" />
<p>Apart from its appearance, there's little known about this new forme of Mewtwo's, thus making it difficult to interpret the meaning of its new physique. Overall, I find it to be more feminine in design, with a sleek body, thick hips, and a slender ovary ponytail to round things off. Granted, it's hard to judge this design in an unbiased manner as all features will be compared to Mewtwo's mutant hide, so this forme's avocado toes and protruding head disc do seem silly and not required. Overall, I find it neither ingenious or repulsive, thus leaving me with a neutral opinion, where my only complaint is that its tail could have been integrated better onto its body rather than just being an elongated head with a color change at the beginning. B for effort.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker magistrum">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_magistrum.png" alt="Magistrum" />
<p>As if Mewtwo needed something like this. It would've been okay for me if this guy was a separate Pok&eacute;mon that is somewhat a spawn of Mewtwo, to follow up on Mew's backstory. But no, Frieza Mewtwo just had to forme-change into Majin Buu. Rant aside, I am perhaps one of the few people that liked the design the first time I saw it. Its smug look, the sleek coronet, the flowing tail behind its head, and the regal purple tint on parts of its body just tells you that he is enlightened, and demands respect. I like it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker snowpeashooters">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_snowpeashooters.png" alt="SnowPeashooters" />
<p>I had been so excited to hear that Mewtwo was making a return in the new movie. Until I saw this…Mewthree-thing. Mewtwo went from being one of the coolest humanoid Pok&eacute;mon around to looking like something out of my primary school doodle notebook. Actually, Mewthree wouldn't be so bad if say, it transformed into Mewtwo. But put it the other way round, and I just can't take it seriously. What's with those toes? And the general baby-fied proportions? And that giant tail attached to the back of its head? As an ardent Mewtwo supporter, it shames me to say this but I dislike the new design utterly and thoroughly.</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker zapdraws">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_zapdraws.png" alt="ZapDraws" />
<p>f you ever watched Dragon Ball Z, you'll likely have seen the villainous Frieza. His gimmick was to change from bulky, chunky versions to smoother, sleeker designs that made him far more powerful. Mewthree, or Newtwo, whatever you want to call him, immediately invokes the Frieza concept. What ruins this one for me is that this forme simply does not look as powerful as the original Mewtwo design. It's like turning the Terminator into ASIMO, a step down in that fearsome visage that fit Mewtwo's incredible power level. This version looks like he's retaining water in his head. I just can't like this one.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Chespin</h2>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_chespin.png" alt="" /></div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker bummer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" />
<p>Chespin is a novel creature who single-handedly destroyed the tradition of having Grass starters restricted to lizards. With its nimble body and delightful appearance, this little forest dweller should be able to charm most Trainers into accepting it as their own pawn. But it needs more than a leaf hat to be seen as a true Grass wielder, as Sudowoodo, despite its earnest attempts, still remains just a Rock-type. However, the notion of wearing vegetation while at the same time being able to utilize it in battle is a somewhat new territory that has yet to be represented well in the Pok&eacute;mon kingdom, with Wormadam perhaps being the only other example. Its higher stages will, however, have more weight in the matter regarding the design of this grass rodent, and I'm eager to see whether or not my anticipation will become rewarded or disappointed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker snowpeashooters">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_snowpeashooters.png" alt="SnowPeashooters" />
<p>I really don't have much to say about Chespin except that its design leaves much to be desired. So we've got a Water frog, a Fire fox, and a Grass what-the-heck-is-this. After some research, I realized it was supposed to be hedgehog. In what way does it look like a hedgehog? It just appears to be an overly tanned thing in a badly designed green hoodie. Its too-happy expression and beady eyes just makes it look derpy instead of the intended cute. Bleargh. Come on, Game Freak, this Grass starter looks worse than a Turtwig with a bad hair day.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker birkal">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" />
<p>I always pick the Grass-type starter. Always. Without exception. Bulbasaur was the first Pok&eacute;mon I ever owned, and the lineage of excellence continued from there with Chikorita, Treecko, Turtwig, and Snivy. When Chespin popped up in the Nintendo Direct, I fell in love all over again. Its charm and adorableness surpass that of many of its Grass-type predecessors. From its cute little hat to its little quills, Chespin will go down in the ages as one of the best Grass-type starters. It looks spunky enough to deal out some damage with rolling, kicking, and punching moves, yet lovable enough to snuggle up with. I can't wait to fight with my own Chespin at the release of the next generation.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker zapdraws">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_zapdraws.png" alt="ZapDraws" />
<p>The weakest design of the new starters, Chespin looks like a Normal-type Pok&eacute;mon, one of the early-game throwaway Pok&eacute;mon at that, put on a green cap from Hot Topic and tried to pass himself off as a Grass-type. The starters have traditionally been almost monochromatic, in either red, green, or blue. If one was to line up those starters in a row, Chespin sticks out like a sore thumb. He looks like a pretender in that crowd, and wearing a rather poor disguise at that.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker magistrum">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_magistrum.png" alt="Magistrum" />
<p>I like this guy. Pretty much the combo-breaking mammal Grass-type starter after 5 grueling generations of reptiles; it's refreshing to see this guy take the spot of #1 in the regional dex. The Grass-type is poorly-represented in Chespin compared to other starters like Bulbasaur and Snivy, probably because of the brown color scheme which is quite prevalent on common Normal-types, but I'd settle with this derpy Happy Tree Friends Pok&eacute;mon rather than having an all-green rodent that looks like a chipmunk version of The Hulk. *cue "Hulk Smash!" in chipmunk voice*</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Helioptile</h2>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_helioptile.png" alt="" /></div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker magistrum">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_magistrum.png" alt="Magistrum" />
<p>Argh you cute little puppy lizard thing. Why do I see Mawile in you? Yes, the first time I saw its leaked scan, I thought this was supposedly Mawile's baby. But no, it was an unrelated Pok&eacute;mon with a pretty interesting typing. Looking at some animations it is based on a frilled lizard, and everyone who's watched Jurassic Park knows its horror. (If you haven't watched it yet, shame on you.) However, thanks to that same reference, Helioptile gathers quite a hype on what its evolution will be. I couldn't agree more though&mdash;the roundly shaped eyes and the simple but cute reptilian body (hi Scraggy!) just makes you want it to grow into a complete badass (hi Scrafty!).</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker zapdraws">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_zapdraws.png" alt="ZapDraws" />
<p>Okay, now we're getting close. The new Electric lizard has a great color scheme, good body design, but an odd head design. The ears could easily evolve into a neck frill, which would make quite a lot of sense. They seem a little out of place, though, giving this guy a doglike appearance. The lines in between his eyes don't seem to be anything, either. Nitpicky? Sure. But so far, this is the strongest design.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker birkal">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" />
<p>Gughaguh. Incredible. The New York Times raves that Helioptile is the greatest thing to happen to Pok&eacute;mon since Scraggy. I happen to agree; Helioptile is a massive cutie. My favorite genre of Pok&eacute;mon is that of the "derpy" variety, meaning that any Pok&eacute;mon that looks like it's clueless about everything that's going on is a hit in my book; Slowpoke, Quagsire, Scraggy, and Hoppip are all good examples of this. Helioptile's goofy eyes and floppy ears land it squarely in the center of this derpy category, making it a hit in my book. Its Normal-type allows it to have an extra sense of adorableness as it waddles around on its short, stubby legs. The frills that pop out of its ears are a nice touch. I wouldn't be surprised if Helioptile becomes one of the big names of Generation 6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker bummer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" />
<p>If Chespin has a cute hat, then Helioptile beats it in spades, despite the small technicality that it's not wearing one. Electric-types are generally unimaginative creatures where they're simply capable of generating electricity with no obvious reason as to why. This yellow lizard, however, does, as its head tattles of inspiration from electric circuits, or even the bottom of a light bulb, thus revealing a clear connection to its primary type. So while it doesn't look much now, I am certain that its evolutions will expand its theme in more detail, but for a basic stage, I deem Helioptile to be an innovative creation, and with a decent name to boot.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker snowpeashooters">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_snowpeashooters.png" alt="SnowPeashooters" />
<p>It's…kind of cute? I think the overall design is alright. Pretty simple, standard colors, big watery blue eyes. Judging from the fact that the things hanging down its head are frills that can unfurl, I can't but think of one those intimidating spitting lizards. But it's too adorable to be scary, and as the preevolutionary form, it definitely fits the harmless-looking criteria. My only nit-pick is that it's not "electric" enough. The yellow is not vibrant but dull, and there seems to be no space for it to store electricity. The typing could probably have been conveyed a little better.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Gogoat</h2>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_gogoat.png" alt="" /></div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker snowpeashooters">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_snowpeashooters.png" alt="SnowPeashooters" />
<p>Gogoat is one of the best designs Game Freak has ever come up with, in my opinion. It's simultaneously fluffy, cute, and large, which makes it seem extremely comfortable to ride on. I also love the idea of riding these things in a city. Though we've had tons of cow/deer/goat-based designs in the past, none of them are done as masterfully as Gogoat.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker bummer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" />
<p>As a goat, I really like Gogoat. Impressive horns, solid feet, determined eyes, and a beard saturated with wisdom. So despite its fluffy exterior, this is a creature that appears to be confident in every situation it may find itself in, and act with either brute force or careful strides. But as a Grass Pok&eacute;mon, I find it incredibly generic. Imagine, if you will, that the green bushes covering its neck and back to be white. If that would have been the case, it would simply look as a Normal-type. But since its cozy collar is green, it is therefore a Grass-type. It's that simple, and equally as dull. So while the actual design appeals to me, simply adding some green to it did little to make its typing more justified. Particularly so as it'd probably still look fine without it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker magistrum">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_magistrum.png" alt="Magistrum" />
<p>It seems like Hoenn's Mach Bike and Acro Bike closed shop from day one in the Kalos region because they pale in comparison to the existence of the fricking goatmobile. I like how all Grass-type Pok&eacute;mon based on mammals really don't disappoint on the looks. Design-wise, this wonderful ibex Pok&eacute;mon is both adorable and strong-looking at the same time. The green bushes compliment the...uhh... bushy brown fur, much like the color scheme on Chespin. Overall I'm liking it and now I wanna ride it like a pimp.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker zapdraws">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_zapdraws.png" alt="ZapDraws" />
<p>And Helioptile loses the title already! Clearly a Grass-type with the bush tufts, Gogoat is the poster Mon for Pok&eacute;mon riding. The body has a strong shape, the horns act as a steering system. These are great aspects of the design because they actually have a purpose. Brown, tan, green, and white all work together well here. Really, I have no complaints. This will likely be one of the best designs of the new gen.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker birkal">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" />
<p>In a phrase: Gogoat is what Sawsbuck should have been in Generation V. Although there are differences between the two, their same general features are almost identical. Horns are their primary weapon. They have greenery wrapped around their chest. Their color scheme relies on brown, white, and green. All of these similarities make Gogoat stand out as a poor design in my mind. I do like the gimmick of riding Pok&eacute;mon in Generation VI, but I can't help but feel like another Pok&eacute;mon could have heralded in that gimmick better. Imagine the Trainer riding something like Rapidash, Arcanine, or even Mamoswine in the XY Trailer. I have the feeling that would have stirred up a lot more excitement within the Pok&eacute;mon community. Gogoat's only redeeming quality is that it's made for riding. If it didn't have that, it would not be a notable addition to the world of Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Sylveon</h2>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_sylveon.png" alt="" /></div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker zapdraws">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_zapdraws.png" alt="ZapDraws" />
<p>How does Game Freak hand us the gift of a new Pok&eacute;mon type? Why, they literally gift wrap the newest Eeveelution! Seriously, the ribbon effect could have worked, but it goes too far, and one can't help but fear sending this one out to battle, because Sylveon is going to trip over any one of the dozen or so loose, flowing ribbons coming out of its body. If this thing doesn't have Wrap in its movepool, I will be disappointed; that's just a missed opportunity.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker snowpeashooters">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_snowpeashooters.png" alt="SnowPeashooters" />
<p>Ugh, when I Google for images of Sylveon, I feel the rainbow cupcake honey sparkles flying out of my screen, bombarding me with the sheer…gaiety of this new Eeveelution. I understand that the Eeveelutions have generally been progressing towards the cute side. I also understand the need for Game Freak to appeal to more girls. But this! It is beyond my wildest imagination that Eevee could evolve into a monstrosity like Sylveon. Pink and white all over, long silky hair, huge blue eyes, pwetty ribbons made of skin everywhere. I'm sorry to say this, but unless Sylveon's been tested to fill a niche in competitive battling very well (hi, Blissey), it's highly unlikely that I'm going to want to see much of it after the initial craze has died down.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker bummer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" />
<p>I find Sylveon to be creepy. There, I said it. While ribbons and scarves are usually a welcome sight, they do little to comfort the unhealthy look that Sylveon is displaying. Pale skin. Empty eyes. A body mostly consisting of skin and bones, and to top it all off, a color scheme that appears to have its origins in candy cane factories. So while its delicate and fashionable design clearly sets it apart from its Eevee brethren, it has sadly ended up as more of a stuffed doll rather than a living being wandering grasslands and plains. Admittedly, we still have no clue how one actually breeds a Sylveon, so if it happens to be the result of dipping an Eevee in a vat of synthetic dyes, then I suppose all my qualms will be resolved.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker birkal">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" />
<p>I couldn't agree with Bummer more; Sylveon is creepy. Its body flows with ribbons and bows, and its color scheme contains cute pastel colors, like cream and pink. But if you look at just its eyes alone, it looks ghastly, almost sinister. Those giant orbs are lifeless, in my opinion, and give me the hibbly jibblies. I think that its design is sloppy and over-complicated. If you've read my excerpts in JAP before, you'll know that I prefer simplistic designs. Sylveon is a bad combination of clutter and eeriness; it will likely go down as my least favorite Eeveelution to date.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker magistrum">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_magistrum.png" alt="Magistrum" />
<p>Eeveelutions are a few of the solid moneymakers of the sugar-coated cuteness and fuzziness of Pok&eacute;mon merchandise, and Sylveon is a welcome addition to this adorable group. Although I hate to drag a Pok&eacute;mon Biology rant here, how the heck does this cat have organic ribbons on its body? The colors remind me of Delcatty yet the sky-blue eyes, flowing ribbons, and the subtle blue parts give it something to set it apart. Overall the design is adorable, but it would've made do without the ribbons.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Yveltal</h2>

<div class="align-center"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_yveltal.png" alt="" /></div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker magistrum">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_magistrum.png" alt="Magistrum" />
<p>Even though Pok&eacute;mon XY's setting is mostly European, and Yveltal is actually inspired by the unnamed eagle that nests atop Yggdrasil in Norse Mythology, the Japanese can't help but add a touch of their own. Yveltal's dark vibe doesn't only come from the striking red-and-black color scheme, but also the claws on its wings and tail, which is loosely based on the Yatagarasu, the three-legged crow. Pretty menacing design, but is almost at the ranks of cluttered legends like Dialga and Palkia.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker birkal">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_birkal.png" alt="Birkal" />
<p>I'm a bit confused about how this Pok&eacute;mon actually... moves. It's got three appendages and seems to be very flat from the footage we've seen so far. I like the color scheme; the reds and the blacks compliment each other well, while its blue eyes distinguish it from Groudon's coloration. But to base an entire body shape off the letter 'Y' seems awkward to me. Yveltal doesn't strike me as realistic, and feels a bit thrown together as a result. However, I have to admit that I like it more than some of the recent legendary Pok&eacute;mon Game Freak has created. I despised Reshiram and Zekrom, and didn't think the Gen IV legendaries were any better. I can tolerate Yveltal, so kudos to it, I s'pose.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker zapdraws">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_zapdraws.png" alt="ZapDraws" />
<p>Yveltal, besides the bizarre name, kind of bothers me. The high-five flier (tri-five?) has a serpentine look that better fits a strong Dark-type, but not a legendary. He just doesn't strike me as a flier, as he actually looks fleshy with a furry mane. I honestly could see Hydreigon as a legendary more than this one. But honestly, with the sheer volume of legendaries, it's getting harder to create fresh designs that can impress.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker snowpeashooters">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_snowpeashooters.png" alt="SnowPeashooters" />
<p>Besides the obvious conundrum with the pronunciation of its name, Yveltal's a pretty cool guy. He definitely looks like the evil overlord who dominates some planet out there. Red and black, the classic badass colors, mixed well enough to convince the general Pok&eacute;mon fanbase that he's a Dark-type. Speaking from a protagonist's point of view, it makes more sense to own a rainbow deer of justice, but if you're the anti-hero type of person, then by all means, grab the badass huge flying bird and proceed to scare the living lights out of your enemies.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-speaker bummer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/jap_bummer.png" alt="Bummer" />
<p>It's surprisingly hard to look upon Yveltal without assuming that it's an evil creature. It has all of the typical symptoms of it: dark appendages, sharp claws, a narrow look, ominously red skin, and a stylish tuft of grey hair billowing from its neck. Even if it's not evil, it totally looks capable of shredding your team and yourself into shreds if you give it the opportunity. Much like the letter it's based on, its whole body signals that it aspires to defy the standard quo, bringing chaos into order, darkness into light, or any other stereotypical simile that escapes me at the moment. Overall, it looks like a cool beast to have within your roster, although its three large arms do seem impractical when it goes stationary. Legendaries sure are wacky.</p>
