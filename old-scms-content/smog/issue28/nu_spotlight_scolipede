<h2>History</h2>

<p>Scolipede was in RarelyUsed for most of its competitive life; however,  in the April tier changes it became NU for the first time since Stage 0.  For the most part, Scolipede didn't have too much to offer on the  competitive scene; Accelgor was a faster spiker in RU, and power-wise  its Attack was low in comparison to the rest of the tier. It almost  dropped to NU in January's tier changes, however it only just held on  and remained in RU. However, despite this, the NU community still  predicted how Scolipede would influence the NU metagame if it did drop.  Many thought it would easily be within the top five, given how useful  Spikes were, and the fact that it could single-handedly provide a way to  shut down Musharna, 2HKOing it with its STAB Megahorn.</p>

<p>Now Scolipede has been in NeverUsed for two months, it has found itself a  9th position in the regular usage stats, and 4th position in the 1850  usage stats. Spikes weren't common in NU before Scolipede dropped,  however, once it did, that changed. Roselia and Garbodor were used for  Spikes, although nowhere near as much as Scolipede is now. Scolipede has  also helped stop the Psychic-type domination of Stage 8, and has  contributed to a faster metagame. Scolipede has now cemented itself as a  prominent part of NU, and chances are it will rise in popularity over  the next few months as faster offense becomes more common.</p>

<h2>Scolipede's Qualities</h2>

<div class="float-right"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue28/nuspotlight_scolipede.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>One of Scolipede's best qualities is its base 112 Speed. It shares the  10th position of highest Speed in the tier with Purugly. With the  majority of offensive threats in NeverUsed being either at or above base  95, the extra Speed allows Scolipede to outspeed huge threats in the NU  metagame such as Jynx and Charizard and OHKO non-scarfed variants with  Megahorn or Rock Slide, respectively. This Speed also allows it to be  the fastest spiker in the tier (with the other common spikers in the  tier, Garbodor and Roselia, sitting at base 80 Speed and base 65 Speed,  respectively), which can almost guarantee one layer of Spikes on the  field. If Scolipede is played conservatively it can set up multiple  layers late-game to help offensive sweepers on its team that lack the  extra power. Scolipede also has access to Toxic Spikes, and like Spikes,  can set up multiple layers throughout the game easily thanks to its  Speed.</p>

<p>Scolipede's other notable quality is its power. Scolipede has base 90  Attack, however, when coupled with Swords Dance, it can hit an attack  power of 558 with a Jolly nature. This can work with its STAB Megahorn,  and its coverage moves of Earthquake, Aqua Tail, and Rock Slide to allow  it to both outspeed and do a lot of damage to the majority of the  metagame. Scolipede's versatility move-wise is also a great quality, as  it has a variety of other moves to utilize, such as Baton Pass, so it  can pass its Swords Dance or Agility boosts to a teammate. Scolipede  also has access to Payback and Poison Jab, however for the most part it  generally doesn't have the space on its sets for either of these moves.  X-Scissor is also an option over Megahorn if you would rather have 100%  accuracy, however, the drop in power is definitely noticeable, and  Scolipede is almost always better off with Megahorn.</p>

<p>Scolipede's other quality is its abilities. Scolipede's most common  ability is Swarm, which can be used in conjunction with Focus Sash and  Swords Dance for a powerful Megahorn when at low health. Due to its  Speed, it can make use of its boosted Megahorn, or coverage moves, and  proceed to speed through any teams it faces. Scolipede also has the  option to use Poison Point or Quick Feet, although they are generally  outclassed by Swarm. This is because Scolipede is mostly hit with  non-direct attacks such as Rock Slide or Earthquake and Scolipede is  more often burned than paralyzed, making the Quick Feet boost mostly  useless.</p>

<h2>Playing with Scolipede</h2>

<p>Scolipede can run a variety of different sets in NeverUsed. Its most  common set is its Spikes set, however its Swords Dance and three  attacks, and Swords Dance + Substitute are also used in the NU metagame.</p>

<p>Scolipede's Spikes set allows it to trade attack power for team utility.  Most of the time when you're using the Spikes set, you'll mainly be  using Spikes and trying to get them out as fast as possible. With its  Swords Dance set it's best to set up when all possible counters are out.  Physical Alomomola sets can be set up on if you correctly predict when  it's using Protect, however most chances Scolipede gets to set up is  when an opponent predicts a Megahorn and switches out to a counter. The  same applies for the Swords Dance + Substitute set, however that has the  advantage of using Substitute. Thanks to Scolipede's Speed, it can keep  using Substitute until it gets into Salac range where it can use Swords  Dance or Baton Pass to pass to an appropriate teammate. Generally the  Spikes set is the easiest to play with as it involves the least amount  of prediction, however when used effectively the other two can steamroll  entire teams.</p>

<h2>Playing against Scolipede</h2>

<p>Scolipede can often be hard to predict. You might think it's safe to  send in your Scarf Charizard against it only to realize it's using a  Focus Sash. On the other hand, you might assume it's the standard Spikes  set and send in Weezing to burn it, but then Scolipede uses Substitute  and passes to Sawk. Despite this, there's a few tell-tale signs to  usually predict what set Scolipede is running. For the most part it will  be running Spikes, however, if there's a lot of Pok&eacute;mon that resist its  weaknesses it's likely Swords Dance, and if it's full of physical  attackers chances are it will be Substitute + Swords Dance. You can't  always be right about what it's running but these are usually the  tell-tale signs. However, with this in mind, defensive switch-ins have  to be aware that Scolipede can set up Spikes against them and laugh off  their attempts to wall it, or can use Substitute and pass Swords Dance  boosts to a teammate.</p>

<p>Despite this, Scolipede has various defensive counters in the tier that  have little issue switching into its attacks and can do something to it  in return. Misdreavus can switch in on any of Scolipede's attacks and  takes around 18% from an unboosted Megahorn and burn it with  Will-O-Wisp. Weezing can do the same as it also resists Scolipede's STAB  and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, too. Golbat also resists Megahorn,  can easily take a Rock Slide from Scolipede, and can threaten an OHKO  with Brave Bird.</p>

<p>Torkoal is another common counter as its defensive set takes little from  Scolipede's attacks and can 2HKO Scolipede with Lava Plume. Gurdurr can  also use Stone Edge if it's running it, or 3HKO with Ice Punch and/or  use Bulk Up if it wishes. Piloswine can safely switch into Scolipede,  however, Piloswine can't OHKO unless it gets max damage rolls from both  Earthquake and Ice Shard. Swellow can switch into Rock Slide and  activate its Toxic Orb, however it has to be aware that if Stealth Rock  is up it will not be able to switch in without fainting afterwards.  Finally, Regirock can safely switch into any of Scolipede's attacks and  OHKO it with Stone Edge.</p>

<h2>Fitting Scolipede onto your team</h2>

<p>Scolipede can fit on a range of teams. However, to use Scolipede to its  full potential it needs some support. For Swords Dance sets, Pok&eacute;mon that can set up on its defensive counters (Weezing and Misdreavus for  example) are what Scolipede needs to to be able to sweep successfully  without little opposition. Spikes Scolipede sets prefer if there's a  spinblocker to make sure Spikes remain on the field. This is because  Scolipede is somewhat frail and its weakness to Stealth Rock means it  can only switch in limited times in the match, and finds it harder to do  so later in the game. However, spinblocking support isn't always  necessary, as with careful play a team can maintain Spikes on the field  without needing a spinblocker. Substitute + Swords Dance Scolipede need  physical attacking teammates to receive boosts. Examples of this are  Sawk, Kangaskhan, and Primeape as they can utilize the boost in Speed  and Attack to their advantage, making them more threatening to their  opponents.</p>

<p>In terms of what it can support, there aren't too many Pok&eacute;mon in  particular that Scolipede can support, however there are a few crucial  roles it can play to teams. Teams that are weak to Musharna enjoy  Scolipede's presence; although Scolipede can't safely switch into  Musharna, it can do significant damage to Musharna and can make the  opponent play more cautiously. Teams that have fast but not extremely  powerful attackers also appreciate Scolipede as it can set up Spikes to  turn 2HKOs turn into OHKOs after switching in. Examples of this are Pok&eacute;mon like Primeape that are great at revenge killing but often lack  the power to dent a significant hole in a team, unlike Sawk, which can  break through teams on its own. For Substitute + Swords Dance Scolipede,  teams with more than one physical attackers also enjoy the extra attack  boosts Scolipede can pass to them, as well as the extra speed. These  are usually Fighting-type or Normal-type Pok&eacute;mon, most of which are huge  threats in the NU metagame.</p>

<h2>Get out there!</h2>

<p>Scolipede can provide useful utility to teams with Spikes, and can also  be a strong force offensively. On its own, it can threaten entire teams  if given the chance to set up, or can pass its boosts to an even  deadlier Pok&eacute;mon. All of this makes Scolipede an important part of the  NU metagame no matter what role it's performing, and it should be  considered when putting together a team.</p>
