<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NU received some interesting surprises in March's usage stats. Munchlax,  Primeape, and Scolipede finally dropped from RU, giving NU some new  toys to play with. The community initially had mixed reactions; some  thought the new drops would be too broken, while others were excited for  the changes they would bring to the metagame. However, a day later,  something even more controversial occurred&mdash;Jynx was unbanned  after being in BL3 for almost a year.</p>

<h2>What was expected to change?</h2>

<p>According to February's usage stats, Rhydon, Klinklang, and Mandibuzz  were all likely to drop, as well as Scolipede, Primeape,  and Munchlax.</p>

<p>Rhydon would have become one of the most popular Stealth Rock users as  well a good wall, with already great base HP and Defense stats of 105  and 120, respectively, enhanced by Eviolite, as well as base 130 Attack.  Pokemon such as Choice Band Sawk would struggle to OHKO Rhydon if it  has enough investment in either HP or Defense. It would also make a good  check to Choice Scarf Jynx, as Jynx's strongest attack fails to OHKO  Rhydon, while Rhydon can OHKO back in return with Megahorn. In terms of  offensive opponents, Torterra is one that would likely increase in  usage, as it can take a Megahorn as long as it's not switching in and SR  isn't up and then OHKO back in return with a Life Orb attached,  although it would die in the process. Alomomola, Tangela, Weezing, and  Misdreavus could take it on and either hit it super effectively or  cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, and thus would likely rise in usage.  Klinklang would struggle against Rhydon, as at +2 Attack it cannot OHKO  Rhydon even without any defensive investment; additionally, with  Primeape and Jynx around, and the optimal base Speed tier being 95,  Klinklang could find itself struggling against some of NU's bigger  powerhouses without a boost. However, it could set up on Alomomola  provided the latter doesn't have Scald, although the Wild Charge damage  does start to hurt Klinklang after a while and Alomomola can just slowly  wear it down or stall it out. Tangela would also be a great check to  Klinklang, as at +2 it can only 3HKO Tangela; however, without Hidden  Power Fire, Fighting, or Ground, Tangela cannot do much back to  Klinklang. Weezing and Misdreavus can also help against Klinklang as  they can burn it and switch to a Pokemon better equipped to handle it,  while Weezing in particular would have more reasons to run Flamethrower  (which is already useful for when Jynx switches in and Scolipede is  behind a Substitute). Seismitoad would also have more usage, as it is  2HKOed by Return when Klinklang is at +2 and can just use Earthquake to  2HKO Klinklang. Klinklang would also help Golurk maintain its #1  position, as Golurk only takes damage from one of Klinklang's attacks  and can OHKO in return with Earthquake. Mandibuzz's drop would've been a  positive for stall, as it has a phazing move in Whirlwind, can Taunt,  and has a reliable recovery move in Roost. However, its Stealth Rock  weakness really hinders it, and the main Pokemon it would've walled,  Musharna, is less relevant now due to the other drops. It can still be a  reliable phazer; however, other special walls would still function  better due to being able to inflict notable damage on their opponents,  while Mandibuzz takes recoil damage from its most common attacking move.</p>

<p>In terms of what was likely to go up, Alomomola, Liepard, and Walrein  were close to the RU threshold. Walrein's move to RU wouldn't have  affected much, as it functions better in hail. Alomomola's rise to RU  would've made a difference to the tier, on the other hand. With the  current physical attackers in the tier still playing an important role  (such as #1 Golurk, Sawk, Primeape, and Scolipede, to name a few),  Alomomola still has an important role in being able to wall those  threats and pass Wishes to teammates. Physical attackers as a result  would have a much easier time with less walls to contend with, and other  less common physical attackers would likely start to rise in usage.  Liepard's rise to RU wouldn't have made much of a difference, as its  most common and main set revolves around hax and targets no specific  threat. Murkrow could rise in usage though, as it can fulfill the role  Liepard played, albeit not as effectively.</p>

<h2>What's Changed?</h2>

<p>NU has changed dramatically since the new additions have arrived. The  slower Psychic-type domination of Stage 8 has become a distant memory,  as NU has become much faster. With Jynx and Primeape's base 95 Speed,  and Scolipede's base 112 Speed, the need for faster Pokemon to check  these threats has increased.</p>

<p>Swellow has risen in usage, being able to outspeed and hit both  Scolipede and non-Scarf Primeape super effectively with its STAB; it can  also hit Jynx hard with U-turn and is immune to Lovely Kiss due to the  status inflicted by Toxic Orb or Flame Orb. Weezing and Misdreavus have  also risen in usage to put a stop to Primeape and Scolipede, taking  little damage from their attacks and being able to cripple them with  Will-O-Wisp. Weezing in particular can easily take hits from Primeape,  but doesn't appreciate a Choice Band Earthquake from Mold Breaker Sawk.  Tauros has also seen an increase in usage, due to it being able to  outspeed and OHKO Scolipede, Jynx, and Primeape after Stealth Rock (even  Scarf variants of the latter two) with Choice Scarf. Even without a  Choice Scarf, its naturally high Speed allows it to be a strong revenge  killer.</p>

<p>Priority has also become more useful in this metagame to get around  faster threats. Kangashkan has benefited from the need for priority;  while it's not the optimal Speed tier, access to Fake Out and Sucker  Punch makes it suitable for most teams. Carracosta is also more useful  in this metagame, as it can threaten Jynx and Scolipede with OHKOs if  Sturdy is intact and make it dangerous for them to switch into it. At  +2, it can also OHKO Primeape after Stealth Rock with an Adamant nature  and Life Orb. It also has Solid Rock to halve damage taken, which makes  it easier for it to set up a Shell Smash.</p>

<h3>Primeape</h3>

<p>Primeape has made the biggest impact on the metagame of all the new  additions and sits in 3rd position in the April usage stats. Its base 95  Speed is extremely beneficial to it and has raised the Speed tier of  this metagame. Primeape can outspeed Pokémon such as Kangaskhan and  Zangoose, which is something Sawk couldn't do unless it was Scarfed.  Primeape also has access to U-turn, which is one of its many great  qualities. With U-turn and a Choice Scarf, it can make an excellent  scout that can help a teammate, such as Swellow, get in safely and  activate its Toxic Orb. U-turn also allows it to do decent damage  against other Psychic-types, which is something Sawk struggled with.  Additionally, Sawk has also decreased in usage by around 4%, with  Primeape picking up the slack. Primeape also has Taunt, which can stop  Misdreavus from inflicting a burn on it with Will-O-Wisp, while Primeape  can hit it back with Beat Up or Punishment. Sawk, on the other hand, is  forced to take the Will-O-Wisp or switch out. Primeape can also prevent  Misdreavus from setting up Nasty Plot or use it to its advantage with  Punishment, depending on which it chooses. It also has access to Encore,  which can lock Misdreavus into Nasty Plot and make it take a heavy  beating from Punishment.</p>

<h3>Scolipede</h3>

<p>Scolipede has an amazing base 112 Speed and base 90 Attack.  Additionally, it has access to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, a boosting move,  Baton Pass, and more than one coverage move. It also has a useful Poison  typing which allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes and set your own layers  of Spikes. Due to the Spiking role being similar to Roselia and  Garbodor, they have both decreased in usage during April, while  Scolipede has reached 4th position on the ladder. Spikes in particular  is one of its best selling points, as it's the fastest Spiker in NU and  can attack back in return, something that Roselia and Garbodor can't do  as well. Even without Spiking in mind, Scolipede's Attack and Speed  allow it to OHKO or 2HKO a variety of Pokemon, including past threats  such as Musharna, which dominated Stage 8.</p>

<h3>Munchlax</h3>

<p>Munchlax has been the least domineering addition to NU&mdash;the  only new addition to not be in the top 10 in the usage stats, falling  into the 66th position. Despite this, Munchlax still has a small niche  in NU. It can be a viable special wall, as it has Thick Fat to help it  sponge STAB Ice-type attacks from one of the most prominent special  attackers in the tier, Jynx. One of its downfalls though is that it has  to run Eviolite to maintain bulk, while other special walls such as  Lickilicky, Mantine, Articuno, and Regice have Leftovers recovery.  Lickilicky in particular has access to Wish, meaning it doesn't need to  rely on Rest for recovery. With that in mind though, Munchlax can run  Sleep Talk to help it against Jynx with Lovely Kiss, which is something  Lickilicky cannot do. On the other hand, Lickilicky can also phaze and  isn't entirely weak to Taunt as Dragon Tail is an attacking move whereas  Munchlax's Whirlwind isn't, while Articuno and Regice have the  advantage of naturally resisting Ice Beam; Articuno also has access to  Roost to help it recover.</p>

<h3>Jynx</h3>

<p>Jynx is one of the most interesting additions to NU after it was  unexpectedly freed, sitting in the 8th position in April's stats. Jynx  was originally banned in April 2012; however, now that Jynx is free,  things have changed for the former queen of NU. With Scolipede,  Munchlax, and Primeape also in the tier to keep it in check (although  only Munchlax can safely switch into that, and only if Jynx is lacking  Psyshock), as well as a whole lot of faster threats that are already in  the tier, Jynx has a harder time sweeping. However, Jynx can be a  powerful force when facing unprepared teams and will likely rise in  usage over the next few months. Jynx has access to Lovely Kiss, helping  it to force switches or set up on its opponents. However, Lovely Kiss  has shaky accuracy and can be the difference between losing or winning a  match. In terms of other options, it can also use Choice Specs, Choice  Scarf, Calm Mind, or anything else it needs for coverage, as Jynx's  Psychic typing gives it access to a diverse movepool.</p> 

<h2>What can we expect to see in the coming months?</h2>

<p>In the next few months, faster threats are likely to appear. Zebstrika  has the necessary Speed to outspeed all of the newer Pokemon as well as  Overheat to hit Scolipede. Charizard in particular will likely become  more popular, as the Scarf variant can outspeed and OHKO most Jynx,  Scolipede, and Primeape sets (with the exception of Choice Scarf  Scolipede, which isn't very common). Metang is also likely to rise in  usage, as it can counter most Jynx sets bar Choice Scarf/Choice Specs  with Bullet Punch while being a reliable Stealth Rock user. Serperior is  also likely to get more usage, as it can outspeed Scolipede and Jynx  and hit them hard with Hidden Power Rock, as well as outspeed other  relevant Pokemon such as Carracosta. Other physical walls could also  rise, such as Golbat, which is 3HKOed at most by Primeape and 4HKOed by  Scolipede while it can threaten them with an OHKO from Brave Bird in  return. Additionally, weather could also be a strong force in the next  few months, as sun has powerful sweepers such as Charizard which can  already hurt the metagame as it is, and Jynx can benefit from rain with  Dry Skin.</p>

<p>With that said, Gardevoir will likely drop in usage, as Jynx is faster  and generally has more use in this metagame due to the dual STAB and  access to Lovely Kiss and Nasty Plot, whereas Gardevoir can only really  pull off specially defensive or weather-supporting roles better than  Jynx. Musharna will likely see less usage as it now has less  opportunities to set up Calm Mind and will rather have a utility role  for the most part.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Stage 9 has already been interesting, and it can only get more interesting from here. Over and out.</p>
