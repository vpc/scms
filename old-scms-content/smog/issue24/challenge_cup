<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Competitive battling isn't all about selecting the proper move on Choice Band Terrakion and watching it mow through things, or frustrating your opponent's physical attackers with a Cofagrigus. Wouldn't it be nice sometimes to battle with and against derpy, extremely unconventional Pok&eacute;mon with crazy movesets? Welcome to Challenge Cup, a versatile metagame in which you can get any Pok&eacute;mon with any moves and have to figure out what to do with them. For those who are unfamiliar, I'll explain in full detail what Challenge Cup is, the mechanics of how it works, and many strategies that will help you win, because after all, you're going to have to find some way to beat that Palkia with some of those Neverused and Little Cup Pok&eacute;mon you pulled.</p>

<h2>How does Challenge Cup work?</h2>

<p>Unlike what you're used to, in Challenge Cup, you don't choose your team. From the entire list of Pok&eacute;mon, you're given six random, unique Pok&eacute;mon. Yes, it is possible to get Geodude, Graveler, and Golem on the same team. Each Pok&eacute;mon is given an item, chosen at random from the comprehensive list of items that have some effect in battle. So, your Wooper, who is not weak to Steel, can be given a Babiri Berry, which halves the damage from one super effective Steel-type attack. The moves are also completely randomized. From the list of all of the moves that a Pok&eacute;mon can possibly know, by means of leveling-up, TMs, HMs, Move Tutors, or anything else, four are chosen at random and given to each Pok&eacute;mon. Qualities such as nature, EVs, IVs, gender, and happiness are also randomized. If a Pok&eacute;mon can possibly have more than one ability, the ability it has is chosen at random too, because they know we all love Truant Durant. The only thing that is not random is the Pokemon's level, which is based off of the Pok&eacute;mon's base stat total. The higher the base stat total a Pok&eacute;mon has, the lower the level it will be. This serves to help even out the field between Pok&eacute;mon with significantly different strengths, which means that Sunkern's chance of beating Lugia has risen from 'pretty much zero' to 'approximately zero'.</p>

<h2>Common moves in Challenge Cup</h2>

<p>Even though all moves are randomized, you can still expect to see somewhat of a pattern because of uneven move distribution throughout the sea of all Pok&eacute;mon. Because an enormous percentage of Pok&eacute;mon can learn Rain Dance or Sunny Day, you will often get at least one Pok&eacute;mon that knows a weather-summoning move (Sandstorm and Hail aren't nearly as common). There are also many damaging moves that are extremely common. Nearly everything can learn Return and Frustration, and other very common moves are things like Facade, Secret Power, Hyper Beam, Giga Impact, and Round. Because Pok&eacute;mon tend to learn more STAB moves than moves in other types, and due to the widespread distribution of many Normal-type attacks, it's not a terrible idea to assume that your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon have a STAB and a Normal-type attack. This sometimes isn't true because there are so many horrible, non-damaging moves that your opponent could have, but just because Challenge Cup sets are honestly pretty stupid a lot of the time, you can't send in whatever you want and expect your opponent to not be able to hurt you that badly. You also have to think about how vast an opponent's movepool is. A Mewtwo can learn attacks from basically every type, so you can't just send in a Dark-type and assume you'll be okay. Alternatively, Pok&eacute;mon like Luvdisc are pretty easy to predict. If you've noticed that pretty much all of the common moves are Normal-type, however, it won't be a surprise that sometimes one or maybe multiple of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon won't be able to touch a Ghost-type and will do very minimal damage to Rock- or Steel-types. Additionally, there are some other fairly universal moves that don't cause direct damage which are seen more often, such as Rest, Protect, Substitute, Toxic, Swagger, Attract, and Double Team. Yes, at least on Pokemon Showdown!, there is no Evasion Clause in Challenge Cup. Yes, you can utilize it, and yes, I will talk about it later because for some reason, Double Team fits very well in the next section of this article.</p>

<h2>Effective moves in Challenge Cup</h2>

<p>Since your Pok&eacute;mon can literally have the worst moves imaginable, you're going to have to redefine what you think of as an effective move.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="/media/upload/smog/issue24/challengecup_wooper.png" alt="" /></div>

<ul>
<li><h3>ANY powerful (or somewhat powerful STAB) moves</h3>

<p>Usually you'll end up with a couple of nearly useless moves. Sometimes you'll end up with a Pok&eacute;mon that literally cannot inflict any damage or status upon the opponent. Therefore, strong attacks or any reasonably-powered STAB attacks are harder to come by. Moves like Stone Edge, Surf, and Crunch that you might consider to be normal in standard metagames are blessings in Challenge Cup. A Pok&eacute;mon's only form of offense is often pretty weak, which means that you'll be doing less damage overall and you should pay attention to Pok&eacute;mon which have really powerful attacks.</p></li>

<li><h3>Entry hazards</h3>

<p>Rapid Spin is incredibly rare for anyone to get. If you get any hazards up, they will almost certainly be there for the remainder of the match. Plus, since the damage output in Challenge Cup is less than in normal battles, that 12.5% from Stealth Rock makes more of a difference. Toxic Spikes may be one of the best moves in Challenge Cup. If you get lucky and get a Pok&eacute;mon with them, try to get two layers up ASAP.</p></li>

<li><h3>Recovery moves</h3>

<p>A smaller damage output also means that recovery moves are more effective because your opponent will have to deal out more hits until they can cancel out the HP you recovered. Unlike in standard metagames, in which a team's cleaners may be able to OHKO or 2HKO most of the other team with the right opportunity, Challenge Cup Pok&eacute;mon can often only do 20-30% to an opponent with each hit, making half health recovery a whole lot sweeter. Even Rest without a sleep-cure Berry or the ability Early Bird can be pretty effective, not only to shrug off status, but also because of the low damage output of some of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon.</p></li>

<li><h3>Status-inflicting moves</h3>

<p>While your two Pok&eacute;mon are duking it out with powerful Covets and Grass Pledges, burn and poison, especially Toxic poison, really rack up. Those conditions are so effective because again, your attacks are doing less, so you're going to be staying in for longer and incurring more damage from status than you normally would. Along with Toxic Spikes that I mentioned earlier, the move Toxic itself is also one of the deadliest moves in Challenge Cup. Like always, sleep and paralysis are effective too for gaining crucial free turns and crippling speed. Attract and confusion-inflicting moves, namely Swagger, are also fairly common, and both can be used pretty effectively. Although it's very unclear whether your opponent will have physical or special attacks, unlike in normal battles, you can still usually Swagger safely against Pok&eacute;mon with horrible attack stats.</p></li>

<li><h3>Substitute</h3>

<p>Substitute has always been a great move. Aside from its common uses in standard battles, another nice thing about Substitute in Challenge Cup is that sometimes your opponent is literally incapable of breaking your Substitute in one hit. It's also not that hard to force switches in Challenge Cup because really, how many Mantyke are going to stay in against a Magnezone? You often find yourself in situations in which you can Substitute on the switch. The only drawback is that the probability of you getting Substitute and any form of recovery is disappointingly low.</p></li>

<li><h3>Evasion-boosting moves</h3>

<p>Since there's no Evasion Clause, at least on Pokemon Showdown!, in Challenge Cup, you can Double Team as much as you'd like. Moves like these were banned in standard play for a good reason, but you're allowed to abuse them if you want. It's pretty self-explanatory: boost up and laugh as they miss Aerial Aces...wait.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Which Pok&eacute;mon are good?</h2>

<p>When it gets down to it, even though Pok&eacute;mon with higher BSTs are at lower levels, Pok&eacute;mon with higher BSTs and/or Pok&eacute;mon in higher tiers are better than lower tier or unevolved Pok&eacute;mon. Fully evolved, high tier Pok&eacute;mon's stats, even at a lower level, are superior to those of Little Cup Pok&eacute;mon. Although you definitely shouldn't count first stage evolution Pok&eacute;mon out, your "weapon" Pok&eacute;mon will generally be those legendaries and other similarly powerful Pok&eacute;mon. Additionally, hyper-offensive Pok&eacute;mon are usually more threatening than walls. In the normal metagames, walls often rely on recovery and status, as well as moves like Seismic Toss to inflict reasonable damage. If a stall Pok&eacute;mon has none of those three, which is very possible in Challenge Cup, it loses a lot of its potency. Those suited towards offense, like Thundurus-T, don't suffer as much in Challenge Cup because even if the moves aren't as strong, they can still dish out a lot of damage. Of course, how good a Pok&eacute;mon is in Challenge Cup isn't absolutely based on its tier or its BST, but generally, when you're looking through your team, if you see a powerful Pok&eacute;mon with at least one good move, even though its level is in the 60s, it'll probably put in a lot of work for you.</p>

<p>What about other really good Pok&eacute;mon that aren't so high-tiered or legendary? There is one at the very bottom that, not surprisingly, is a real threat in Challenge Cup: Shedinja. Since its BST is so low, it's level 95, similar to many first-stage evolutions. The immense lack of versatility in move type makes Shedinja able to wall many things, and for a Pok&eacute;mon at level 95, it's got an insane Attack stat. Plus, if your opponent switches out, it's pretty obvious what the Pok&eacute;mon they switched in is going to do. Ditto is another interesting one. Fortunately, it's a high level 90, so even though it has a terrible HP stat, in Challenge Cup you could actually find a Pok&eacute;mon with a lower HP stat than it and gain an advantage. Obviously, these two are rare and circumstantial, and overall, it just comes down to luck and what moves you pull in determining which Pok&eacute;mon are threatening or not.</p>

<h2>Battling Strategy</h2>

<p>Before you can battle well, you have to know your own sets and items, right? As obvious as it is, this step is something that people occasionally forget to do. You don't want to use Protect to scout for a dangerous move and then realize your Pok&eacute;mon has Choice Specs. Generally, you need to know right from the get-go which Pok&eacute;mon on your team are weapons, which are dead weight, and which are okay. Playing more Challenge Cup will help you get a better sense for whether a Pok&eacute;mon is a weapon or not, but look for some of the effective moves I talked about above when scanning your team for Pok&eacute;mon that could potentially carry your team, because believe me, some of your other Pok&eacute;mon will need a whole lot of carrying. Breloom with Seed Bomb and three stupid moves? That's a weapon. An Umbreon that has Toxic and Moonlight? That's the jackpot, unless of course you're playing the dude who somehow has four Steel and Poison Pok&eacute;mon, but you get the idea. About 5% of the time, your held item is actually useful&mdash;often times you get a Berry you've never heard or something&mdash;so keep your eyes out for Pok&eacute;mon with good items that will make them more of a threat. And by useful, I mean it actually does <em>something</em>. ~95% of the time the held item literally doesn't do anything good.</p>

<p>The whole point is that you need to keep your weapons safe if at all possible. Don't let them take any more damage than they have to. Again, it's not that uncommon for you to pull a Pok&eacute;mon that cannot do any damage nor inflict any volatile statuses. You might think those Pok&eacute;mon are absolutely useless, but one of the best things you can do with them is use them as pivot switches to keep your weapons safe. After all, your opponent shouldn't assume that your dead weight Pok&eacute;mon can't do anything to them. If he or she does realize that, you can pivot out to one of your okay Pok&eacute;mon or just fodder off the dead weight Pok&eacute;mon to prevent anything else from taking any unnecessary damage.</p>

<p>Looking at your opponent's team, it's also your job to figure out which Pok&eacute;mon of theirs are weapons. Like always, alarms should go off in your head when you see someone hit you with something deadly. Think about why they used a certain move in a situation. Does their Pok&eacute;mon not have anything better to hit you with? Figure out which of their Pok&eacute;mon have better physical or special attacks, because unlike in standard, it's not obvious. Then, you can send in your physical or special 'walls' accordingly. Additionally, at least on Pokemon Showdown!, your opponent doesn't know which Pok&eacute;mon you have until you send them in. Remember which Pok&eacute;mon of yours your opponent has seen so you can surprise him/her.</p>

<p>Like in all forms of battling, regular psychological and prediction aspects apply. What's your opponent's playstyle? Can you figure out how to predict their moves? Do they predict your moves? Do they switch a lot? It's always important to figure out these kinds of things, opening the door for opportunities to perhaps use an elusive boosting move safely or double switching out into another threat or what-have-you. The key difference between Challenge Cup and regular battling is having a sense of how good or bad your average Challenge Cup Pok&eacute;mon is so you can realize what your weapons are and how to keep them safe.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Challenge Cup is an awesome, fun, and different form of battling that everyone should try. It's a nice change from regular battling and in some ways tests different skills. How would you go about winning with a Wooper? Did you get a lucky Wooper that can deal good damage with Surf? Did you get a horrible one that is only used for pivot switching between your better Pok&eacute;mon? It's a fun and exciting challenge, and hopefully I've inspired you to play and given you some tips on how to improve. Now go out there and just have a blast! Some of the funniest and stupidest moments can happen in Challenge Cup. It's up to you to experience them and enjoy them.</p>
