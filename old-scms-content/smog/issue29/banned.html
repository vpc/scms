<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ubers&mdash;it's a harsh wasteland where only the strongest Pok&eacute;mon survive. Turns are in the blink of an eye and HP bars drop faster than a drunkard on a bike. You need to prepare for beasts of horrifying power. Prepare for the horrors of those like Blaziken, Genesect, Thundurus, and Excadrill.</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>

<p>You heard right! These former OU beasts are still kicking butt! Although they've been banned, they have enough power to fight side-by-side with the likes of Kyogre and Arceus. In this article, we'll take a look at more recently exiled 'mons, looking at why they were banned, and how they're doing in their new tier. Let's go!</p>

<h3>Blaziken</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/257.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Few trainers imagined that a cute little Torchic could evolve into a game breaking menace, but then came Generation V's Blaziken. With Hi Jump Kick getting a buff to 130 Base Power and Speed Boost creating a nigh-uncatchable revenge killer, the flaming chicken certainly made its name known in OU. After a Swords Dance, few Pok&eacute;mon were safe, with even potential counters being 2HKOed by Flare Blitz in the sun. Truly, the extreme wallbreaking power Blaziken had burdened OU with was insane. Needless to say, on March 27th, 2011, history was made when Blaziken became the first starter to ever get banned.</p>

<p>Today in the Ubers territory, Blaziken remains powerful, merciless, and very, very fast. After just one Protect, it essentially throws on a Choice Scarf and proceeds to start becoming Pok&eacute;mon's very own version of "The Flash", dishing out lightning-fast blows left and right.</p>

<p>Even in Ubers, with its combination of STAB Flare Blitz and Hi Jump Kick, Blaziken is able to demolish just about anything in two hits or less after a Swords Dance. This carnage can be taken to even more absurd levels with the addition of sun. In the sun, Flare Blitz will be doing even more damage to your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, turning many 2HKOs into OHKOs. It's important to note that when you factor in Life Orb, Hi Jump Kick can actually be replaced with Low Kick. The very notion of Low Kick may seem odd, but Ubers is surrounded by immensely heavy Pok&eacute;mon, and missing just one Hi Jump Kick ruins Blaziken. Blaziken is frail enough as it is, and a 50% loss in HP is simply not worth the risk. Shadow Claw is an option as well. It allows Blaziken to hit offensive Giratina-O and Psychic-types harder, but this move has a high opportunity cost&mdash;you'll need to either remove Protect or Swords Dance, neither of which Blaziken wants to do.</p>

<p>However, the blazing bird is far from invincible. Despite Blaziken's overwhelming power, it is hard-walled by both Giratina formes, as well as other bulky Psychic-types in the rain. To make matters worse, Blaziken has little to no bulk, and has extreme difficulty finding an opportunity to set up with Swords Dance. Flare Blitz's recoil also limits its lifespan even further; Life Orb Blaziken will probably kill itself before sweeping a whole team.</p>

<p>But Blaziken is not alone in its Uber endeavors. In terms of teammates, Groudon is Blaziken's best friend. With Groudon providing sun via Drought, Blaziken's Flare Blitz can hit its very hardest. In addition, the Continent Pok&eacute;mon can set up Stealth Rock, allowing Blaziken to have an easier time bringing down opposing Pok&eacute;mon. Darkrai is another terrific teammate. As mentioned earlier, bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types give Blaziken trouble. Darkrai strikes fear into these checks and counters, allowing the kung-pow chicken to continue its rampage, unhindered. Finally, a teammate or two that can deal with Extremekiller Arceus is practically mandatory. Blaziken just doesn't have the bulk to survive a +2 ExtremeSpeed.</p>

<p>Despite its issues, with its combination of Speed and power, Blaziken has remained a true tour-de-force in Ubers. It's hard to believe so much pain can come from a starter Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<h3>Excadrill</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/558.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The fifth generation of Pok&eacute;mon not only buffed up past-gen Pok&eacute;mon, but added new terrors as well. Excadrill was one of those terrors. With an awesome base 135 Attack stat, two immunities, and only a handful of checks that could stop it, this mole was downright menacing. The fact that it had access to Rapid Spin was the icing on the cake. But it was Excadrill's ability, Sand Rush, that really pushed it over the top. In sand, its solid base 88 Speed <em>doubled</em>, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier! With its combination of Speed and power, Excadrill quickly gained notoriety, particularly with its Adamant Life Orb set. While acting as a team supporter, it was easily the best offensive OU spinner in the tier, using Shadow Claw to smite any Ghost-type foolish enough to switch in. Meanwhile, if it ran an offensive set, a Swords Dance would send its Attack to a whopping 810 <em>after one turn</em>. If sand was in play, Excadrill would become a nigh-undefeatable nightmare.</p>

<p>Flash forward to today, and Excadrill is still a monster on teams if played correctly. Support-wise, Excadrill remains the best offensive spinner in the tier, with only Swift Swim Kabutops giving it a run for its money. While the mole works like a champ in sand, a bulky Rapid Spin set with the EV spread of 176 HP / 60 Atk / 252 SpD / 20 Spe, can also function very well in rain, being able to give stall teams a significant headache. Perhaps the best thing about Excadrill is that with its raw power, it has an easier time beating spinblockers than any other Pok&eacute;mon, save for perhaps Cloyster. Truly, Rapid Spinning with Excadrill is far from a chore.</p>

<p>The other viable role Excadrill can play is as a physical sweeper in sand. Much like in OU, an Adamant Life Orb set with Swords Dance, Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Iron Head will put a serious dent in any opposition. Now let me make this clear: this Excadrill set <em>needs</em> sand support. The above bulky Rapid Spin set functions well in multiple weathers, and can take a hit or two because it has solid defensive investment. The Achilles heel of this sweeping set is that all it takes is a weather change to ruin Excadrill's day. However, should Sandstorm constantly remain in play, Excadrill will be fast enough to set up, and then start wreaking havoc. It's finally very important to mention that Leftovers and and Air Balloon can be wonderful items for both sets. An Air Balloon can let Excadrill outright wall Gliscor, one of the mole's hardest counters, and even turn it into set-up fodder before the balloon is popped. Meanwhile, Leftovers lets Excadrill stomach more hits, and have an easier time beating Skarmory, another prominent check.</p>

<p>When talking about teammates, checks, and counters, Kyogre immediately stands out. Excadrill really has a love-hate relationship with the leviathan. If it's on your team, you can use it to deal with Excadrill's checks, e.g., it can scare out or KO Groudon. However if it's on the opposing side, it can remove sand, and proceed to KO Excadrill with a super effective STAB attack. Grass Arceus is universally helpful to Excadrill though, being able to check both Kyogre and Groudon. Meanwhile, the sweeping set needs Tyranitar or Hippowdon. Without sand, this set can be KOed by many faster Ubers, including Palkia, Ho-Oh, and Reshiram. As for counters, Skarmory, Gliscor, and Bronzong are hell for the mole, as they sponge any attack Excadrill throws at them. Lugia is also an obstacle unless Excadill runs Toxic, a move that's actually quite useful to chip away at Pok&eacute;mon like Groudon and Kyogre. Truly, if Excadrill is used correctly, you'll find that it's one mighty mole!</p>

<h3>Genesect</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/680.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being ranked #1 in OU usage is a testament to just how powerful Genesect really was. With a great defensive typing, an expansive movepool, and its ability, Download, boosting its base 120 offenses, this Pok&eacute;mon was a true OU terror. With a Choice Scarf and its fearsome STAB U-turn, it could check nearly all Psychic- and Dark-types in OU, including Alakazam, Reuniclus, Tyranitar, and Celebi. Meanwhile, it could use its great special attacking prowess to deck dragons with Ice Beam, roast Grass-, Steel-, Ice-, and Bug-types with Flamethrower, and fry Water- and Flying-types with Thunderbolt. All in all, this Pok&eacute;mon was like the terminator&mdash;powerful, cruel, and hard as hell to stop. Needless to say, on November 30th, 2012, Genesect was banned to Ubers, a victory for organic life forms everywhere.</p>

<p>But the cyborg could not be forgotten, and today, Genesect's danger has definitely not diminished. Still packing its Download-boosted STAB U-turn, it can lead, scout, clean, and more. Currently, Genesect's premier mode is, once again, with Choice Scarf, enabling it to slowly whittle down an opponent's team through hit-and-run tactics. A Naive physically-based Choic Scarf set with 252 Attack, 252 Speed, and a movepool of U-turn, Iron Head/Explosion, Ice Beam, and Thunder/Flamethrower can check, revenge kill, and KO prominent Ubers such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, Rayquaza, Kyurem-W, and Dark Arceus. Given how well Genesect can chip away at a team, it can then become outright incredible if given hazard support from the likes of Deoxys-S or support Dialga. Hazards support + U-turn works amazingly for Genesect in that the cyborg can hit hard with STAB U-turn, and even if your opponent switches into something that resists it, U-turn gives you momentum via allowing you to switch into an appropriate counter of your own, all while opposing switch-ins take entry hazard damage. Choice Scarf Genesect is such a solid Pok&eacute;mon that it can even function as an emergency answer to many Calm Mind Arceus formes, being able to Explode in the face of things like Water Arceus, and finishing off weakened Ghost Arceus with Iron Head.</p>

<p>This is not to say Genesect is nigh on invincible. Despite having U-turn to flee from potential checks, this cyborg can be beat by those such as Reshiram, Steel Arceus, Ho-Oh, and specially defensive Giratina. Bulky Pok&eacute;mon like Lugia and Ghost Arceus can become a real headache too, often being able to set up in Genesect's face. Also, because Genesect will switch out so often via U-turn, hazards&mdash;particularly Spikes&mdash;will really eat through its HP, leaving it vulnerable to priority attacks from the likes of Extreme Killer Arceus.</p>

<p>Fitting with the terminator vibe, Genesect is a fiercely independent predator, and doesn't need much help to put the hurt on its enemies. Still, there are several Pok&eacute;mon that can really help Genesect reach optimal efficiency. As mentioned earlier, reliable hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Dialga are great partners. Forretress also deserves a mention&mdash;while it's also weak to fire, it can set up hazards, spin them away, Toxic bulky threats, or keep the momentum of battle on your side with Volt Switch. Tentacruel can play a similar role to Forretress, providing a safe switch-in to any oncoming fire attacks, and then being able to spin away hazards while setting up some of its own. Kyogre also pairs well with Genesect because one of Kyogre's major checks, Latias, almost becomes a liability when you have a Genesect. Finally, Ho-Oh can be a fantastic partner by letting Genesect U-turn away from threats, sponging Fire-type attacks, and then switching back into Genesect at the right time, restoring its own health through Regenerator. Seriously, at the end of the day, Genesect remains one deadly machine in Ubers, being able to do serious damage to most of the tier. If you care for your Pok&eacute;mon, watch out!</p>

<h3>Thundurus</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/672.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The ancient Greeks worshiped a being named Zeus. Zeus is the king of the gods, being able to harness lightning to strike down all who dare go against him. On the onset of Gen V, Game Freak gave us Thundurus, a Pok&eacute;mon that embodies the might of the god king himself. With a shockingly high base 125 Special Attack, an incredible base 115 Attack, and a solid base 111 Speed working in tandem with his wonderful Prankster ability, Thundurus was able to smite down almost any OU opposition. After a single Prankster-aided Nasty Plot, Thundurus's Special Attack would hit 698, letting him severely damage prominent OU threats like Salamence, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn with its frightening attacks, which include Hidden Power Ice, Grass Knot, and Focus Blast. But it was with rain via Politoed that Thundurus could do real damage. A perfectly accurate STAB Thunder would fry just about anything that dared stand against the genie, allowing it to dominate the tier. Even faster revenge killers could be shut down via a Prankster Thunder Wave, making Thundurus even harder to stop. All in all, Thundurus was fast, ferocious, and demanded attention. After much outcry, Thundurus was finally banned in October of 2011.</p>

<p>In Ubers, Thundurus has become far easier to take down, yet can still hit hard with its high Special Attack stat and cripple opposing Pok&eacute;mon with priority status moves. There are two major roles that Thundurus can perform in its new tier. It can function as a Prankster user, or can use Nasty Plot to turn into a frighteningly powerful special sweeper. The Prankster set functions as a solid lead, being able to shut down hazard setters like Custap Forretress with Taunt, and being able to neuter fast leads like Choice Scarf Genesect with Thunder Wave. This set can also dish out pain with STAB Thunder, Hidden Power Ice, Grass Knot, and Hammer Arm. It's important to remember that Thundrurus should <em>not</em> be used as a suicide lead. While the above set can lead, it should not sacrifice itself in the process as Prankster Thunder Wave can save you from a set-up sweeper late in the game. But aside from utilizing Prankster, Thundurus can also run a boosting set with Nasty Plot. Although harder to pull off, a Nasty Plot set cranks Thundurus's power level over 9000, which means it can let loose the most powerful Thunder in the game, while also hitting things hard with a combination of Hidden Power Ice and Focus Blast. Nasty Plot is <em>very</em> important for an offensive Thundurus, as without it, Thundurus often won't hit things hard enough.</p>

<p>When thinking of teammates, one Pok&eacute;mon should come to mind immediately: Kyogre. Like Politoed in OU, Kyogre provides the rain that lets Thundurus use a perfectly accurate Thunder. In addition, a Stealth Rock setter such Dialga can help the genie gain some important KOs on things as tough as Lugia. Honestly, Thundurus is pretty independent, though its Thunder Waves greatly aid slower Ubers such as Swords Dance Groudon in tearing apart an opponent's team.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Thundurus is somewhat of a two-trick pony, and is not terribly hard to take down. An Ice Beam or Stone Edge from just about any Uber will 2HKO at worst. Due to its poor bulk, even neutral hits will do significant damage to Thundurus. Lum Berry Extremekiller Arceus is a particular check; it can boost with Swords Dance and KO on the next turn, outrunning the genie with higher priority. To top things off, Stealth Rock strips 25% of Thundurus's health with every switch in, limiting its lifespan even more. Still, despite these flaws, play Thundurus well, and you'll certainly give your opponent a headache.</p>

<h3>Deoxys-S</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/389.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, do you like using entry hazards? Do you enjoy constantly chipping away your opponent's team and punishing them for any switches they make? What about dual screens, do you guys like those? Well, what if I told you there was a Pok&eacute;mon that nearly always sets up hazards and screens without fail? Now, trust me, this creature is no tall tale. This guy is no flight of fancy. This thing isn't a story told behind the pool hall. People, people, let me present to you the one, the only, OU Deoxys-S!</p>

<p>In all seriousness, Deoxys-S was one hell of an OU lead. With a blazing fast base 180 Speed, and decent 50 / 90 / 90 defenses, this thing was practically guaranteed to set up at least two layers of hazards, or both Reflect and Light Screen when equipped with a Focus Sash. That's a 50% increase in your team's defenses, or at least 15% of your opponent's health being stripped away with every switch in. Not surprisingly, the alien was deemed unhealthy for normal competitive play.</p>

<p>In Ubers, Deoxys-S may be easier to take down, but as long as it holds a Focus Sash, it's still a darn good suicide lead. With its sky-high Speed stat, it remains capable of setting up hazards, screens, or limiting opponents by using Taunt. If Taunt's not your style, Deoxys-S even has access to Magic Coat, allowing it to bounce back hazards, status moves, and even enemy Taunts! Outside of being a hazard layer or screen setter, there's one final viable role Deoxys-S can play&mdash;a phenomenal Trick user. When given a Choice Scarf, the alien has an extreme likelihood of moving first, letting it impair a Pok&eacute;mon on the opposing team early on. Deoxys-S can even set up a layer of hazards or two, and Trick an opponent later if that's more to your liking. Additionally, Fire Punch can fit into the above sets, letting the alien beat bulky Excadrill, Forretress, and even Genesect.</p>

<p>Due to Deoxys-S's immediate support capabilities, it functions best on an offensive/hyper offensive Ubers team. These teams heavily appreciate the indirect damage caused by Stealth Rock and Spikes, which really adds up over the course of a battle, and lets KOs come easier. Screen setting Deoxys-S really aids set-up sweepers in particular, with the defensive boosts making it easier for something like an Arceus or Rayquaza to get a boost or two. Despite its Speed, Deoxys-S isn't completely independent. Spinblockers such as the Giratina forms aid Deoxys-S by keeping hazards on the opponent's field, and can even shuffle enemies around via Dragon Tail and Roar. Meanwhile, countering Deoxys-S can be troublesome due to its tendency to lay down Stealth Rock, a Spikes layer or two, then die. Magic Bounce Pok&eacute;mon like Xatu and Espeon can beat it, but they loathe being Tricked. Prankster users such as Thundurus or the rare Whimsicott can beat it via Prankster Taunt though, only fearing Ice Beam. Regardless, Deoxy-S hasn't changed much from its OU days&mdash;it's still fast, supportive, and quite the lead, so watch out guys and gals!</p>

<h3>Tornadus-T</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/681.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the animal kingdom, there are creatures known as &quot;birds of prey&quot;. These ruthless beasts rule the sky and send lesser creatures running for their lives. Back in early BW2, this deadly description fit Tornadus-T to, well, a T. Boasting an amazing base 121 Speed, a strong base 110 Special Attack, and a solid base 100 Attack, all backed up by a feature-packed movepool, Tornadus-T was truly an intimidating titan in OU. To make matters worse, Tornadus-T was given an immunity to Spikes and a nifty ability, Regenerator, allowing it to function as a spectacular hit-and-run attacker. Regenerator even allowed Tornadus to shrug off its nasty Stealth Rock weakness by gaining health back upon switching&mdash;something most Flying-types would kill for.</p>

<p>A Life Orb set consisting of U-turn, Superpower/Focus Blast, Heat Wave, and STAB-boosted Hurricane unleashed some serious damage in OU. Taunt and Rain Dance could be substituted into this set as well, enabling Tornadus to shut down hazard layers, or make it rain to increase Hurricane's accuracy while potentially giving some team support. With a Timid or Naive nature, this set could destroy prominent OU powerhouses such as Scizor, Conkeldurr, and Magnezone. To make matters worse, Tornadus-T's Speed stat let it outpace the entire unboosted tier, and even many Choice Scarf Pok&eacute;mon! But if you still thought Tornadus-T wasn't hitting hard enough, or maybe wasn't fast enough, there was another set you could use: a Choice set with either Choice Specs or Choice Scarf. With Choice Specs equipped, barely anything could avoid being 2HKOed by Tornadus-T. With such immense power, it wasn't too long before animal control came to remove Tornadus-T, moving the monster to a new, more suitable environment: Ubers.</p>

<p>Now in its harsh new habitat, Tornadus-T is not nearly the threat it once was. Despite still being able to fire off mighty STAB Hurricanes, its base stats underwhelm when compared to the rest of the tier. As silly as it sounds, 110 Special Attack begins to looks meager when compared to all the beasts packing base 120 Special Attack or higher. Still, access to base 121 Speed and Regenerator lets Tornadus-T carve out a niche as a Pok&eacute;mon that not only heals all entry hazard damage on a switch, but also shuts down stall at any point in a match with a fast Taunt.</p>

<p>Being such a good stallbreaker, Tornadus-T works best on teams that have trouble with entry hazards. With a Life Orb set consisting of Hurricane, Superpower / Focus Blast, Taunt, and U-turn / Heat Wave, Tornadus-T can go up against nearly any solid stall Pok&eacute;mon and come out on top. Additionally, should Rayquaza threaten your team, you can even sub in Hidden Power Ice to show your opponent who really rules the roost. If you find Tornadus-T's power a little lackluster, you can also run a classic Timid Choice Specs set. Unlike most Choiced Pok&eacute;mon, Tornadus-T has little difficulty switching in and out due to Regenerator. With a moveset of Hurricane, Focus Blast, Heat Wave, and Hidden Power Ice / U-turn / Air Slash, there are few Ubers that the genie can't 2HKO. Choice Specs-boosted Hurricane, in particular, destroys Grass Arceus and Fighting Arceus, two Pok&eacute;mon that give rain teams all kinds of trouble.</p>

<p>Still, Tornadus-T in Ubers really isn't a top-tier predator. Outside of Tornadus-T's stallbreaking capabilities, Shaymin-S really outclasses it due to its higher Speed and Special Attack. In addition, Hurricane's mediocre 70% accuracy demands Kyogre support in order for Tornadus-T to reliably abuse its best STAB option. To make matters worse, walling Tornadus-T is far from impossible; Giratina, Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Lugia take a pittance from even Tornadus-T's hardest-hitting attacks. Truly, Tornadus-T's defenses are poor enough that most bulky attackers can switch in, take a blow or two, and KO back. Silk Scarf Extreme Killer Arceus can even outspeed and KO the bird after Stealth Rock damage. In all honesty, Tornadus-T is still a good Pok&eacute;mon, but outside of its niche as a stallbreaker, its hunting days are numbered.</p>

<h3>Deoxys-D</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/388.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We now come to Deoxys-D, the epitome of defense. With a base 160 Defense and Special Defense alongside a movepool chalked full of utility moves, Deoxys-D made for one heck of an OU team supporter. Much like Deoxys-S, the most troubling thing about Deoxys-D was how well it could set up hazards. Barely anything could 2HKO it, letting it easily set up one layer of hazards or more. Setting up Reflect and Light Screen was also an easy task, with screens increasing the alien's defenses to extreme levels. Like its other formes, Deoxys-D was finally banned from OU in February of 2013.</p>

<p>In Ubers, even with massive damage-dealing monsters like Choice Specs Kyogre running around, Deoxys-D remains a bulky stalwart that can reliably set up hazards, screens, and more. Unlike Deoxys-S, this forme has good staying power, having the bulk to last for most of a match. It excels at spreading statuses, either crippling fast Pok&eacute;mon with Thunder Wave, or chipping away at health bars with Toxic. It can also reliably restore its health via Recover, letting it function well on stall teams. With these attributes, Deoxys-D is an outstanding addition to both stall and balanced teams that need either an answer to Latios or Calm Mind Arceus formes.</p>

<p>There are two prominent sets that Deoxys-D tend to run. The first is as a spectacular utility wall. With an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD, almost no unboosted Pok&eacute;mon can knock this Deoxys-D out in one hit. With Spikes, Recover, Taunt, and Seismic Toss, this set is an ideal hazard layer, being able to reliably set up hazards in the face of powerful attackers such as Groudon and Dialga. If that set is less to your liking, there is also a Toxic, Recover, Taunt, and Agility set that works wonders against many Ubers, specifically bulky Pok&eacute;mon. After an Agility boost, Deoxys-D hits 506 Speed, allowing it to halt opposing set-up attempts with a lightning-fast Taunt and whittle away at Pok&eacute;mon with Toxic. Taunt is the crux of this set, enabling Deoxys-D to avoid becoming Spikes fodder and being crippled by enemy Taunts and Toxics. It's also worth noting that Deoxys-D is a solid dual screens user, which can greatly aid offensive teams.</p>

<p>It's not all good news for Deoxys-D, though. Despite packing massive defenses, its HP stat sits at an unimpressive base 50, letting it be 1-2HKOed by exceedingly powerful attacks like Reshiram's sun-boosted Blue Flare and Kyogre's rain-boosted Water Spout. In addition, Deoxys-D is destroyed by Taunt, Trick, and Encore. However, should you avoid these situations, you'll find a team supporter that has no rival.</p>

<h3>Landorus</h3>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/675.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And finally, we have our newest Uber arrival, Landorus. Landorus was one of OU's most prominent attackers. If its counters&mdash;many of which were unstable&mdash;were taken out, the genie could easily plow through teams. U-turn lets Landorus overcome Celebi and Latias. Only Intimidate Gyarados could reliably check Landorus, and the serpent's troubling Stealth Rock weakness did it no favors. In the end, Landorus was banned by a 56.8% margin, just managing to get kick upstairs to Ubers, a ban that will be revisited after Keldeo gets tested.</p>

<p>In Ubers, Landorus may be weak to common Ice and Water moves, but it makes up for this fault by packing immunities to both Ground and Electric moves. Its stats aren't too shabby either, with base 125 Attack pairing nicely with base 101 Speed. The Speed in particular jumps out, seeing how most Ubers have a base Speed of 100 or less. Landorus's Attack even gets boosted by its ability, Sand Force, turning it into an offensive nightmare on sand teams.</p>

<p>As for sets, Landorus can wreak havoc with a Swords Dance set. After an Attack boost, Landorus becomes a true terror when you factor in the boosts from both Life Orb and Sand Force. Stone Edge and Earthquake are Landorus's primary means of doing damage, forming the classic EdgeQuake combo&mdash;something that gets unrestricted coverage across the entire tier. For the final option, Grass Knot can be used to hit things like Groudon hard, or Rock Polish can be used, letting Landorus move to the speed of light. Aside from the set-up set, however, Landorus makes for a very capable Choice Scarf user; its Speed beats out the common Choice Scarf Palkia. Once again, Stone Edge, Earthquake, and Grass Knot all have merit, but this set can also utilize U-turn to hit Psychic-, Grass-, and Dark-types hard, as well as letting Landorus scout and keep up momentum.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, sand is a must if you want Landorus to hit its hardest due to Sand Force. That's why Tyranitar and Hippowdown make for good companions. Like most Pok&eacute;mon, Landorus really enjoys entry hazard support due to how much easier it lets Landorus get KOs. Ferrothorn and Forretress are premier examples, with the former helping check Kyogre, a beast that can remove sand, tank a hit, and KO Landorus with Ice Beam. Additionally, Skarmory and Bronzong outright wall all Landorus sets that don't pack Smack Down or Gravity. Therefore, powerful Pok&eacute;mon with Fire-type attacks can be helpful, with good examples being Dialga and Palkia. Overall, despite being a newbie in the Ubers tier, Landorus is no joke, and can still pack a punch.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So there you have it. Despite being banned to Ubers, these Pok&eacute;mon continue to stand out, with many of them being able to take down half the tier. Others can set up hazards or check major threats. Why not get out there and try one out? The results may surprise you!</p>
