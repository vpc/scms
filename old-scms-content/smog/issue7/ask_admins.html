<div id="interview">
<div class="aside1"><p>Let's open this article with a question.</p></div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>What are the criteria for choosing questions to answer in Ask the Admins? &mdash;Aura Guardian</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>Lately, and particularly in this issue, there has been a load of questions that seem to miss the point of Ask the Admins. That's why, for this issue, we will try to outline the purpose, and elaborate on some questions we normally would not answer, to get this across.</p>
<p>For this, let's take the very first post about Ask the Admins. It was made by Aeolus in a private forum.</p>
<blockquote><p>I've been told over and over that the admins are out of touch with the community. Since The Smog is supposed to be closer to the individual users, soliciting their participation, etc... then I thought I'd suggest an article series here titled: "Ask the Admins".</p>

<p>Users would be welcome to submit questions regarding the site or whatever else they wanted, and a member of the administration would select the best questions and write up answers to them. I haven't talked to the others, so I'll obviously volunteer to do them, at least for now.</p>

<p><strong>I think this might be an interesting way for the community at large to connect with the upper levels of this organization</strong>... because as of now, there is no mechanism for them to do that. Thoughts, comments, suggestions, and concerns are welcome.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bolded part is what it's all about: a connection between the large userbase and the small administrative core of Smogon. It was made to shorten the distance, and to give the public a better insight on what we do, and how we do it.</p>

<p>During the very first attempt at this, there was already disappointing question quality. We hope we can improve that with this article. &mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<h2>"Bad" Questions</h2>

<div class="aside1"><p>Do not take the title of this section at face value. There is nothing wrong with these questions when you look at them in a void. However, they were not what Ask the Admins was intended for. Instead, some of them could just as well be asked in a casual IRC converation, because, believe it or not, behind that bolded username and colourful array of badges, admins are humans just like any of you.</p></div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>What's your favorite section (Firebot, Circus Maximus, Stark, etc.) of the Smogon forums, and why? &mdash;Engineer Pikachu</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>My personal favorite is Circus Maximus, because, while I do not play Pokémon as much anymore, I do really enjoy games.</p>
<p>This question is a very typical example of what I outlined in the introduction. You could hit almost any of us up on IRC, and if we feel like talking about what forums we like, or our lives, or something Pokémon related, then we probably will. &mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>How did you get into competitive Pokémon? &mdash;Slyguy46</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>Just like nearly everyone else: I played the cart, then sometime I found more of Pokémon on the internet. Something like GameFAQs or IGN often ends up being the start of a connection all the way to the Smogon community over the years.</p>
<p>Again, you could just ask people on IRC. Or even better, you could do a search through <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41068">this thread</a>, or any of those linked in it, to find out the answer to this question for about anyone who checks the forums. &mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>This is one I've wondered: what is the origin of the term "Smogon"? &mdash;Arin</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>Not only could this question be asked via another medium, but you could ask almost anyone who has been around for a while. Heck, checking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smogon">Wikipedia</a> would give you an answer so much earlier!&mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>I was wondering if I could make a tribute article to the Six Kings of the OU Pokémon for Shoddy Battle for the webzine? I think it would be a pretty cool article to have. After all, there are six Pokémon stats and there are six Pokémon that match each one perfectly. Will you consider this for a future project? &mdash;GM-Damion</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>Every period where we're working on an issue, there's a sticky that tells you exactly what to do if you have an idea for an article you would like to write, or would like to have written. What makes it a good idea to instead submit this idea in a different sticky? &mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>Have any of the admins met irl? &mdash;Bulldogs</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>While this may not necessarily be the sort of question "Ask the Admins" was designed for... I'd be happy to answer. In the past, certain admins have met in real life. I personally met skarm (a former admin) in Chicago during JAA and we had a great time. The point is, however, that the necessity of a real life meeting to actually "get to know" someone diminishes to almost zero for our purposes since many of us have known each other for years and years online. I've spoken on the phone, via text, and other means with other admins on this site... and I think I know them reasonably well and certainly well enough to cooperate together to administer this great site we've all come to love. &mdash;Aeolus</p>
</div>


<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>What does it mean when an admin/moderator ignores you?          &mdash;pastel</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p><!-- blame eric the espeon --> <span style="font-size: 0.001em;">It means you're a fucking idiot.</span>&mdash;chaos</p>
</div>

<div class="aside1"><p>I think that's about as far as I can go without repeating myself, so here is a list of questions much like the above.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Who was the first admin?</em> &mdash;Delko</li>
<li><em>If you had to pick one favorite Pokémon type, what would it be, and why?</em> &mdash;Darkanine</li>
<li><em>What are your opinions on the new features that Shoddy Battle 2 has to offer?</em> &mdash;Darkanine</li>
<li><em>Of all the avatars currently being used on the forums, which one is your favorite, and why?</em> &mdash;Darkanine</li>
<li><em>What Pokémon type would you consider yourself (and don't say Normal)?</em> &mdash;Slyguy46</li>
<li><em>What's your favorite game besides Pokémon?</em> &mdash;Slyguy46</li>
<li><em>Seeing how much time the admins invest in Smogon, some are practically 24/7 online. Do they all have a good "real life"?</em> &mdash;-Marcel-</li>
<li><em>What's your favorite competitive Pokémon, and why?</em> &mdash;Tomaius</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I do not think there's such a thing as a "bad" question. We definitely appreciate the enthusiasm of the userbase; we just don't really want to use this section to answer questions as if we are celebrities everyone likes to read gossip and fun facts about.</p>
</div>

<h2>"Good" Questions</h2>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>What makes Smogon different from other Pokemon websites, including those that try to have a competitive element? &mdash;eric the espeon</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>We got there first! As childish as it sounds, that's how it is: many of our members pioneered competitive Pokémon, and right now, we're pioneering several aspects of it: analyzing, discussing, and even simulating. The fact that our Suspect Test results seem to impact other communities to a great extent, even though they have the choice to ignore the results and play under their own rules, is a testament to the magnitude of Smogon. &mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>How would you like to see Smogon change and develop over the next few years (preferably specifics)? &mdash;eric the espeon</p>
<p>If there is one thing you would like to fix about any part of Smogon right now, what is it? &mdash;purplefingers</p>
<p>What direction do you want Smogon to go in, or do you want it to just stay as is? &mdash;Aura Guardian</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>Smogon is on the right track towards where I'd want it to be: a site, system, and community that rewards contributions that make it improve, whether it's about the discussion, the analysis, the simulation, or just the community itself. My main gripe with Smogon nowadays is that there seems to be quite a bit of segregation, both in the userbase and in the different "hard" aspects of it. There's Shoddy Battle, there's the forums, there's the website, and there's IRC. I wish those could be closer together, and I know that's what several of the other admins have in mind as well. &mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>What impact do you think Generation 5 will have on Smogon? &mdash;Aura Guardian</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>It will be much like Generation 4. There will be a new subforum, with a lot of discussion and speculation on that tiny bit of new info that's revealed every <em>x</em> days. I hope it is called Uncharted Territory again, as that's what Stark Mountain used to be. There might be a lot of old-timers returning to try their hands at the new generation, and obviously there will be a lot of new people as well. The start of a new metagame is always the most exciting part, in my opinion. &mdash;Mekkah</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker question">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_question.png" alt="Question" />
<p>What's an easy way to get more involved on Smogon? &mdash;rayquazamaster776</p>
</div>

<div class="speaker answer">
<img src="/media/upload/smog/issue7/qna_answer.png" alt="Answer" />
<p>Can't stress it enough: use the Battling 101 Program! The tutors are encouraged, almost obligated, to integrate the tutees. Another way would be to visit the Contributions &amp; Corrections forum. There's often a lot of grunt work lying around that has to be done, and can be done even if you know little of Smogon or competitive Pokémon. &mdash;Mekkah</p>
