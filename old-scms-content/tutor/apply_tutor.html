<p>To apply to be a tutor, you must send a Private Message to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=21476">Limitless</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=107745">Harsha</a>, and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=29254">Bloo</a> with the following information:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pokemon Online Nick:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time Zone:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tier(s):</strong> If you mention more than one tier, make sure they're listed in order of preference. Additionally, make sure you are indeed able to teach in all of them!</p>
<p><strong>Regular Online Hours (in EST):</strong></p>
<p><strong>References:</strong> These people should be well known community members who can vouch for your Pokemon skills and personality.</p>

<p><strong>"Write-Up for why you should be a Tutor."</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>An example application would be as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pokemon Online Nick:</strong> Aeolus</p>
<p><strong>Time Zone:</strong> Central</p>
<p><strong>Tiers:</strong> DPP OU / BW OU</p>
<p><strong>Regular Online Hours (in EST):</strong> 2:00pm - 7:00pm</p>
<p><strong>References:</strong> Bloo, Setsuna.</p>
<p>I think I'd be a great fit for the tutor program because I've devoted my life for the past several months to studying the intricacies of competitive Pokemon as it has developed after the release of DPP. As such, I am extremely knowledgeable when it comes to team-building strategies and battling tactics. Additionally, I am an extremely affable person and I get along well with everyone I meet. People recognize my expertise, respect my knowledge and look to me for advice and direction. Further, I've been looking for a way to contribute to this excellent community; this would be a great way for me to do so. Please consider me for a tutor position!</p></blockquote>
