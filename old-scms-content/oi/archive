<p>Posted by Jellicent on <strong>January 23, 2013</strong></p>

<p>Nintendo will be hosting a Wi-Fi giveaway event for the next few weeks. From January 25th to February 12th, you can pick up Keldeo from the WFC for your Black 2 or White 2 games. This is the first time Keldeo has been given away over Wi-Fi, so be sure to pick up while you can! It comes with the moves Sacred Sword, Hydro Pump, Aqua Jet, and Swords Dance. Once you've obtained Keldeo, look for an opening in the trees around Floccesy Town. Down a path, you'll find a large stone with a symbol that will allow Keldeo to learn Secret Sword and transform into its Resolute Form.</p>
