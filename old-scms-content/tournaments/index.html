<h2>Introduction to Tournaments</h2>

<h2>Playing in Tournaments</h2>

<p>Joining a tournament at Smogon is quick and simple. If sign-ups for a new tournament are open, feel free to post and register.</p>

<p>However, we ask all participants to adhere to some fairly common-sense guidelines. Players who register and become inactive or rarely available can sometimes hold back a tournament; please be courteous and finish your assigned battles promptly. We prefer having tournaments run smoothly, and will not hesitate to disqualify or further reprimand players who are chronically unavailable. If you wish to participate in Smogon tournaments, we ask you to be responsible and reliable. As soon as pairings are posted, make sure to send your opponent a private message and set up a time at which both of you will be able to battle. If for any reason you must leave for a period of time while you are still in a tournament, make sure to contact the host of the tournament and notify him or her of your leave.</p>

<p>Remember, it is not hard to follow these simple guidelines; we reserve the right to ban participants from playing in tournaments for a period of time if such a problem is to arise.</p>

<h2>Hosting a Tournament</h2>

<p>Hosting is the biggest responsibility involved with tournaments, and as such, there are some strict guidelines and requirements for prospective hosts.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you must be a well-known member of Smogon to be trusted with hosting a tournament. If you have joined fairly recently, do not ask to host a tournament; hang around for some time, join a few tournaments, learn the ropes first. Second, make sure that <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=84818">applications are open</a>; they likely will be unless there is a huge number of active tournaments. Finally, write up your tournament application and post it in <a href="/forums/forums/tournament-applications.214/">Tournament Applications</a>. Wait for the Tournament Directors: <a href="/forums/member.php?u=12630">Aldaron</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=29254">Bloo</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=10012">Ditto</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=9718">Eo Ut Mortus</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=29308">Iconic</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=21345">M Dragon</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=59679">McMeghan</a>, or <a href="/forums/member.php?u=62037">Vinc2612</a> for simulator tournaments or <a href="/forums/member.php?u=10012">Ditto</a> for a Wi-Fi tournament to respond. If your idea is approved, you will be notified by a post in the thread and further instruction will be given by the Tournament Directors. When you post your tournament's sign-ups, please include in your post that your idea was approved by the Tournament Directors.</p>

<p>Make sure that you are keeping control of your tournament. Do not get lazy and forget or lag the tournament in any other way. If you let your tournament die your reputation at Smogon will be dented, and you may be banned from hosting another tournament.</p>
