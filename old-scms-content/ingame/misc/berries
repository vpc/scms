<h2><a name="familiar">Becoming Familiar with Berries</a></h2>
<p>The concept of Pokemon trainers collecting Berries to aid their teams is by no means new to Diamond and Pearl. However, with each passing generation, the significance behind Berry collection and utilization has become increasingly notable. The proper utilization of Berries can help you to gain an edge in battle.</p>
<p>Berries are unique in that they can be used by Pokemon automatically during battle when a specific condition is met. An example of such a condition is a Pokemon's HP falling below 50%. Keep in mind that each attached Berry may only be used once unless a Pokemon that has already consumed a Berry uses the move Recycle.</p>

<h2><a name="moves">Moves Based on Berries</a></h2>
<p>The move Natural Gift provides an alternative use for Berries - when used, its power and type change based on the Berry attached. This also "uses up" the Berry, meaning the Pokemon cannot utilize the effects of the Berry or use Natural Gift again without using the move Recycle. Note that even Berries which have no effects when held by Pokemon in battle cause Natural Gift to change. Also, when combined with Technician, if Natural Gift is given a 60 base power attack, the 1.5x boost will be applied.</p>

<p>If a Pokemon using the move Fling throws a Berry at a foe, that Berry's effect is activated immediately on the target. This is difficult to utilize effectively, though it could be used as a means of supplying an ally with much-needed support in a 2v2 scenario.</p>
<p>If a Pokemon uses either the move Pluck or Bug Bite and the target is holding a Berry, they will consume the Berry. This means that the foe cannot consume the Berry, and the Pokemon that used Pluck is immediately affected by the Berry, regardless of whether they are holding an item at the time or not.</p>
<h2><a name="growing">Growing Your Own Berries</a></h2>
<p>Before you begin to plant Berries of your own, there are a few preparations that should be made to make your Berry harvesting more efficient and yield better results. You'll want to acquire a Sprayduck, which is a device that allows you to water your Berries to achieve the maximum possible harvest. This item can be obtained from Floaroma's flower shop. To ensure you don't lose track of Berries you've previously planted or visited, it's also a good idea to pick up the Berry Searcher, a Pokétch application obtainable from the Berry Master on Route 208.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the best results from Berry trees, the soil must always be kept moist to allow as many Berries to grow as possible. Having the Sprayduck will allow you to succeed in this endeavor. The soil will change color based on how moist it is. The darker the soil is, the more moist it is - your aim is to water each patch of soil every few hours to keep them as dark as possible to yield the best results. Note that soil dries out faster during the daytime, so you can afford to water more sparingly throughout the night.</p>
<p>New to Diamond and Pearl are the addition several forms of mulch, which can be used to aid your Berry growing ventures. It's a good idea to be familiar with each type of mulch, as each is useful under different conditions. The Berry Master's wife, present on Route 208, sells all types of mulch for 200 PokeDollars.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Growth Mulch</dt>
<dd>Makes Berries mature in 75% of the time they normally would. When used, the soil requires more frequent watering.</dd>
<dt>Damp Mulch</dt>
<dd>Makes Berries mature in 125% of the time they normally would. When used, the soil requires less frequent watering.</dd>
<dt>Stable Mulch</dt>
<dd>Extends the time in which Berries must be picked before falling.</dd>
<dt>Gooey Mulch</dt>
<dd>Increases the number of new Berry plants that grow where previously matured plants have dropped their Berries.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Berry plants take different amounts of time before they mature enough for Berries to be picked. This depends largely on the rarity of the Berry planted. Furthermore, each Berry plant has its own maximum harvest. That is, the amount of Berries offered by equally well looked after plants will not always be the same. In terms of the Berries this article is concerned with, however, the yield amount is between 1 and 5 Berries per plant, depending on how well nourished the plant is throughout the time it takes to mature. Note that every plant will undergo 4 stages of maturity.</p>
