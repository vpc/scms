<div class="aside">
<p>After several attempts to meet up, we have finally decided to do the interview in Minnesota, where snow in the summer wouldn't be surprising. I was running a bit late reaching the destination; out of all the possible things that could happen last-minute, I just had to forget my notepad containing my questions. The upperclassmen would not be happy if they were to hear of my blunder.</p>

<p>After walking through the door to a small lounge in Apple Valley, I realized too late how hot and humid the day was and immediately felt bad for FireMage, who was soaked with sweat from waiting for my arrival. I sat down next to him and gave him napkin after napkin to clean up. Once he was ready, I began the interview.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>Thank you, FireMage, for agreeing to take part in this interview, especially considering how busy your recent summer has been!</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Yeah, you're telling me x.x, and no problem.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I offered him something to drink, but he shook his head in refusal. Still hesitant of his health, I pressed on with the questions.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>It's amazing to see how many tournaments you have hosted ever since you started! You have hosted quite a few tournaments this past summer, from The NeverUsed Story to the season-long Summer of #Tournaments! How do you manage to stay organized?</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>FireMage pondered for a minute or two before responding, opening his mouth and closing it on multiple occasions.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Honestly, I have no idea. I tend to mostly figure out where I need to be during the week. I go by my weekly events, as planning long-term work can be a pain.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>I wish I could say that I was as organized, but that would be implying that I actually had plans to do anything throughout the week. :c</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I sulked my head, clearly disappointed in how I have carried my life to this point. Feeling the sadness that emanated from me, FireMage decided to lift the mood.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>You should see my bedroom.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I ended up laughing a bit too loudly; the people around us were starting to stare. I quickly changed the subject.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>Anyways, what has attracted you to the world of hosting tournaments?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Uh, I really like hosting and creating things for others to enjoy. It's why this job is almost perfect for me. I know it sounds clichè, but I genuinely love hosting tours, especially when people say, "Hey FireMage, I really liked that tour."</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I smiled in admiration at FireMage for such a wholehearted answer. Wiping the sweat that was building on my forehead, I was struggling to stay focused in such heat.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>A job where someone actually enjoys it.. It's great knowing that you work for your 'fans'. Gotten any fan mail yet? xD</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>Despite the inhuman temperature that we were in, FireMage's face lighted up like a lightbulb when hearing my question.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Yes! JoeyBoy VMed me a thank you from the Meta Tweak tournament, saying that it was a great tour. Because of how well the 2012 Tournament turned out, I got a few other messages as well. No hate mail just yet.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I couldn't resist holding in such a well-timed joke to a response like that. I lightly punched FireMage's arm.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>Key word: 'yet'. Just kidding with you, I doubt someone could hate one of your own creations. Hopefully, you aren't too embarrassed by this next question: Have there ever been any blunders you have made in one of your tournaments that the audience can get a good laugh out of?</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>FireMage's face turned a crimson red at the question and was lost in thought for a bit before answering.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>UHHHHHHH... In my first tour, I successfully managed to confuse a few people with the rules. After trying to explain the rules further, I successfully confused them more! Otherwise, my tours have been relatively blunder-free.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>Ahh, we knew you had it in you! They can be intimidating for first timers, but as you can see, you're living proof that you live and learn. Speaking of which, for those aspiring to host tournaments themselves, do you have any advice to give them?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Oh heck, I covered this in the article Lady Salamence and I wrote, "How to Host a Tournament" in issue #29 of The Smog, but the best piece of advice I can give is to stick by your own decisons and have fun with hosting the tour. It's really not as stressul as people think.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>Just as I opened my mouth to speak, FireMage interrupted me, clearly excited to share advice to the beginners.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Oh oh, and also, encourage people to do their Round 1 matches; there are so many matchups that it takes a while to do activity stuff.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>In spite of being slightly annoyed at the interruption, I slowly began to clap at his words. During that time, FireMage finally accepted my offer of water and began to drink.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>Words of wisdom right there. Make sure to take it to heart, rising tournament hosters! Finally, at the end of the day, is this what you plan on sticking with during your stay on Smogon?</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Well, I will continue creating things a lot of people enjoy. I've already got several projects planned for NU and a lot more interesting tour concepts to boot. Erm, I'm also hoping to get more involved in official tours, too.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>FireMage beamed at the window, staring at the shining sun beginning to set. He had his future planned out.</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker governess"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_governess.png" alt="governess" />
<p>That's heartwarming to know. Smogon can improve for the better with people like you. Personally, I'll stick to writing-related projects; we have our work cut out for us to the top!</p>
</div>

<div class="interview speaker firemage"><img src="/media/upload/competitor/articles/interview_firemage.png" alt="firemage" />
<p>Yeah. Good luck in your writing; I can't do writeups at all, lol.</p>
</div>

<div class="aside">
<p>I apologized to FireMage for planning the interview on such a hazardous day before he left, half-drunken water bottle in hand. I slowly stood up from the couch while thinking about how FireMage would get back home. Pushing the thought to the back of my head, I grinned as I walked out the door; an event in my life actually went well. As if on cue, a chubby, well-dressed man told me that I had to pay for the "high-class" water bottle I bought for FireMage, and he showed me the bill for occupying this lounge. Judging from the lack of athleticism the man displayed, I wondered if I could make a run for it.</p>
