    <h2>LCRUNUlympics Signups live!</h2>
    <h3>Mon 25, Nov 2013</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>After a bunch of tournaments focused on OU, UU, and Ubers, this is a tournament where the host, <a href="/forums/members/cbt.126859/">cbt</a>, will allow the great minds of the under-recognized tiers to shine, in a best-of-3 tournament spanning, as the tournament's name suggests, the BW LC, RU, and NU tiers. All three of these tiers are exciting and well-balanced, due to the constant refinement that the tiers went through for the entirety of BW. Signups have been going for a bit now, hurry before it's too late! ~Lady Salamence</p>

    <h3>Thu 21, Nov 2013</h3>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Bored of standard BW OU? How about a tournament that has a twist! In this tournament, hosted by <a href="/forums/members/129452/">FireMage</a>, players are sent 6 Pokemon randomly to form their starting team. After winning, you can choose to swap up to 2 Pokemon with your opponent's. Like the Battle Factory in-game, switching is not compulsory. This is a best of three tournament, however, and you're allowed to change movesets between games. No, sorry to say, Philip7086 isn't the Factory Head. Regardless, it'll still be a fun non-standard tournament so do sign up. ~sandshrewz</p>

        <p>Hosted by the RU tier leader, <a href="/forums/members/40358/">Oglemi</a>, the second incarnation of the prestigious RU Open has finally came to a close. Many players have gathered to see who would claim the title of an RU champ, and in the end it boiled down to <a href="/forums/members/29254/">Bloo</a>, the Head Tournament Director, <a href="/forums/members/126615/">Dice</a>, a well-know tournament participant, and <a href="/forums/members/192267/">Wepwnemon</a>, an esteemed RU player. The finals starts off with Dice defeating Wepwnemon 2-0, giving Dice the advantage so far. The next match was between Bloo and Dice; if Dice won, he would become the RU Open II winner. The first battle was tight, and both players made very smart predictions in terms of who to switch in and out into. However, a SubSalac Scolipede on Dice's team was the icing on the cake, sweeping the remaining half of Bloo's team. In the second match, it was also a very close match; Bloo was left with a paralyzed +1 Speed Kabutops as his remaining Pokemon against Dice's team of three. While it was very promising, an unwanted paralysis fell upon Kabutops, which ultimately gave Dice the win. Congratulations to Dice as the champion of the RU Open II, Bloo and Wepwnemon for making it to the finals, and Oglemi for hosting the tournament! ~Governess</p>

    <h2>The DPP UU meets BW RU Tournament Signups</h2>
    <h3>Fri 20, Sept 2013</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>DPP UU and BW RU are known for being somewhat similar metagames, with Pokemon such as Moltres and Kabutops being very common in both tiers. However, some DPP UU Pokemon, such as Donphan and Milotic, have never seen the light of RU due to frequent usage in BW UU or OU. This tournament, hosted by <a href="/forums/members/40358">Oglemi</a>, seeks to fix that problem, with various DPP UU Pokemon that aren't currently RU being released into the metagame each round. Will these higher-tier Pokemon break the metagame, or will they make it more balanced? Come sign up to see for yourself! ~CBTerrakion</p>

        <p>In Terrorist Cup, one must use Explosion on all of their team’s Pokemon, and because Explosion sucks in BW, it is usually played with a DPP ruleset. The 2nd installment of a tournament showcasing this metagame recently finished, with the finals being a 3-man battle between Kiry4n, SoulWind, and dragonuser. dragonuser defeated Kiry4n, while SoulWind defeated dragonuser, leaving SoulWind vs Kiry4n as the clincher, a game which SoulWind won. Congratulations to SoulWind for winning, dragonuser and Kiry4n for making the finals, and props to Lady Salamence for hosting! ~CBTerrakion</p>

    <h2>Pokemon Freedom Tournament Signups</h2>
    <h3>Sat 8, June 2013</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Have you ever wondered how standard OU would work if you used less than 6 Pokemon? The Pokemon Freedom Tournament, hosted by Vaz, seeks to showcase such a metagame. One can use between 3-6 Pokemon on their team, but you only have to KO the amount of Pokemon you have on your team, which is used to give players who brought fewer Pokemon no disadvantage against those with a full team. A best-of-3 format is in place for each round, and one must make 3 teams with varying amounts of Pokemon each round. Be sure to sign up, as this tournament is sure to be interesting. ~CBTerrakion</p>

        <p>Little Cup is a tier where one can only use Level 5 Pokemon that are in their first stage of evolution, and the 7th installment of a tournament showcasing it recently finished. The finals were a best-of-3 affair between Lavos Spawn, little gk, and mikel. GK beat Lavos, while Lavos beat mikel, and GK vs mikel never happened due to mikel being busy outside of Smogon, with mikel giving GK the win. Congrats to GK for winning, Lavos and mikel for making the finals, and iss for hosting. ~CBTerrakion</p>

    <h2>Tier Shift Tournament Signups</h2>
    <h3>Sat 1, June 2013</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Tier Shift is one of the many new Other Metagames on the rise, having enjoyed status as Other Metagame of the Month on Pokemon Showdown!, a spot in the Other Metagames Premier League, and the subject of various Smog articles. Now it is making its first foray into the Tournaments forum, with the tournament being hosted by Tier Shift’s creator, PureQuestion. Tier Shift is similar to standard BW2 OU, but it has a twist to it: each of the base stats of all UU, RU, and NU Pokemon are raised by 5, 10, and 15 points, respectively. This turns Pokemon such as Golurk and Stoutland into formidable threats that must be prepared for, as well as many other lower-tier Pokemon. If you want to play OU but want to see how lower-tier threats fare in a more beneficial environment for them, or enjoy nonstandard metagames in a tournament format, sign up, as this tournament will surely be interesting! ~CBTerrakion</p>

    <h2>The Sequels are Never Good Signups!</h2>
    <h3>Mon 26, May 2013</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Despite my personal disagreements with the tournament's name, it's still going to be good. With Malekith as the host and it being a best of 3 tournament with ADV OU, DPP OU and BW OU being the three games, its sure to attract both up-and-coming BW OU kings and older ADV and DPP masters, giving nearly anyone who plays Pokémon a way to do well in this tournament. One of the more surpising things is that the metagames are all following in the respect of its title: ADV will be using the RS200 metagame, DPP will ignore Platinum's changes to the metagame, and BW will be BW1, not BW2. This is going to be a very fun tournament to play in, so go sign up now!</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>If you were around long enough, or read up on the dusty parts of Smogon, you'll know that it used to be there was only three tiers: OU, UU and Ubers. Naturally, those became the 'mainstay' of competitive tiers, which is the base of the tournament&mdash;contestants playing in one of those three tiers, while trying to minimize repetition of teirs. The finals were a best of three with Masterclass, SOMALIA, and WhiteQueen all vying for top spot. Some name-calling and deleted posts later, WhiteQueen left Smogon in a fit of rage, and the Tournament Directors granted SOMALIA the win due to, despite all the confusion, beating Masterclass since WhiteQueen was no longer participating in the tournament. Congratulations to SOMALIA, and to all three finalists for making it that far. Keep it classy, Smogon. ~Lady Salamence</p>

The games that BKC won can be seen <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4459028&amp;postcount=42">here</a>; in Game 1 BKC used a sand stall team relying on Stoutland to mop up weakened teams, while Nachos was using a rain offense team designed to take advantage of Deoxys-D's entry hazards and build up damage with offensive pressure and timely U-turns. Both sides traded luck throughout the game, but eventually BKC's Heatran pulled through and finished off Nachos's Scizor and Spore'd Politoed. In Game 3 BKC used a similar team to the one he used in Game 1, while Nachos used full Baton Pass. Expert Belt Genesect made quick work of Nachos, though: Nachos attempted to Baton Pass from Vaporeon to Mr. Mime, which ate a Thunderbolt. Nachos attempted to use Substitute, but apparently Mr. Mime had not received enough Speed boosts from Ninjask, and was outpaced and left with too little HP to successfully create the Substitute, resulting in its death next turn. Genesect mopped things up from there, as Nachos's last-ditch Ninjask Flash didn't pay off. Congratulations BKC. ~Tobes</p>

        <p>From Start To Finish, hosted by <a href="/forums/member.php?u=1668">Giga Punch</a>, is a tournament with the best-of-three format including GSC OU, ADV OU, and DPP OU except that all matches will be played with Team Preview. This meant that many tactics that relied on the surprise factor of keeping your Pokemon unrevealed no longer worked. The finals came down to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=59925">MarceloDK</a> and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=79509">Ojama</a>. Both of the finalists displayed good sportmanship when they had to restart their GSC OU match countless times due to an accidental illegal move by Ojama followed by MarceloDK disconnecting after they remade their moves. It took several more restarts before they could finally recreate their match such that both players agreed on. Still, Ojama's Growth and Acid Amor Vaporeon paved the way for a sweep, till MarceloDK's Miltank landed a critical hit on the 40% HP Vaporeon. Ojama took the win by destroying MarceloDK's second last Pokemon with a Thunder from Zapdos and the former's Snorlax Selfdestructed on the remaining Miltank.</p>

        <p>However, MarceloDK rebounded back on ADV OU with an odd Toxic Dragon Dance Tyranitar but missed Toxic on Ojama's Swampert. It was compensated by a critical hit Rock Slide and flinch after Swampert activated Tyranitar's Liechi Berry with an Earthquake. MarceloDK bagged the win when Ojama sent in his Calm Mind Jirachi against the former's Calm Mind + Roar Suicune. DPP OU ended in a similar fashion after several Sleep Powder misses from Ojama's Roserade. MarceloDK's Heatran managed to sweep Ojama's weakened team with just Lava Plume; Ojama's Calm Mind Jirachi failed to wall Heatran after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes combined with a burn from Lava Plume that sealed the match. Although there were plenty of misses and critical hits on both sides,  neither player claimed that they were overly determinative of the  outcome. Congratulations MarceloDK! ~sandshrewz</p>

        <p>Congratulations to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=145572">papai noel</a> for beating out <a href="/forums/member.php?u=58803">CrashinBoomBang</a> to win the Unscrupulous Tiering Director Tournament. In this tournament, the banlist for standard OU was constructed from two ban submissions sent in by every user; when a player lost, his or her bans were removed from the banlist (a ban could be submitted by multiple users for duplicity). CrashinBoomBang banned the ubiquitous Stealth Rock and Spikes, a wise and direct incision to remove the cancers of OU, while papai noel took a more esoteric, nay, ethereal approach and banned Dragonite and Tentacruel. As papai noel won, his tiering decisions have clearly proven superior, as was the point of this tournament. Tentacruel, you're on watch.</p>

<p>Onto the battle itself (the log can be seen <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4425953&amp;postcount=31">here</a>): CrashinBoomBang gained an early advantage by effectively eliminating papai noel's Tyranitar with his Choice Band Dugtrio. Choice Band could be seen as an odd choice of item for Dugtrio in a metagame where Toxic Spikes is the only entry hazard, meaning Focus Sash's effectiveness is nearly guaranteed, but CrashinBoomBang's item decision is understandable when taking into account his own Abomasnow's hail. On top of winning the weather war early, CrashinBoomBang's advantage was further pushed when his Alakazam OHKOed papai noel's Rotom-W with a critical hit Psychic. Hax would quickly balance itself though, as Alakazam missed its second Focus Blast against papai noel's specially defensive Heatran, allowing Heatran to finish off Alakazam with Lava Plume. From there, papai noel was able to make a major push with Calm Mind Latias, tanking a Cloyster's Icicle Spear, which gave papai noel's Sheer Force Landorus free reign to finish off CrashinBoomBang's Choice Scarf Magnezone and take the game. Congratulations papai noel. ~Tobes</p>

Randbats is similar to Challenge Cup in the sense that the Pokemon you get is random, but the Pokemon are given more useful moves, items, and natures, giving Randbats some competitive value. Randbats is a quick way to past time if you wish to play something competitive but do not want to make a team; it's also pretty popular in Pokemon Showndown! and it isn't hard to find a match. The tournament came down to a Showdown! between <a href="/forums/member.php?u=81221">DarkLoïc</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=3482">jrrrrrrr</a>, and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=63038">MikeDecIsHere</a>.

<h2>Garchomp in the Smogon Tour?</h2>

<p>Tournament Director <a href="/forums/member.php?u=16630">Kevin Garrett</a> has recently announced something in <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3471600">this thread</a> that shook the entire <a href="/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=203">Overused forum</a>. The final set of practice tours will feature a suspect test. That is to say, Rough Skin Garchomp is allowed in the practice tournaments while Sand Veil is banned. This means that every Pokemon with the Sand Veil ability must use another ability as all of them have an alternative ability. Kevin Garrett also said that the results of this suspect test will be scrutinized by the OU Council; could this mean that there's a possibility of Garchomp being released back into OU? Perhaps. Either way, please remember to pack your Garchomps for the pratice tours and maybe even employ the old DragMag strategy! There's also a suspect ladder on <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/lobby">Pokemon Showdown!</a> for you to test out and play in a metagame with Garchomp released back into OU. In case you're wondering, the last two practice tours for the Smogon Tour will be held today 4 PM, EDT and tomorrow 2 PM EDT on Pokemon Showdown!

<div class="entry">
<p>The Single Pokemon Tournament was one where the participants have to play with a team of Pokemon of the same species. It displayed how some Pokemon can take on several roles by itself and often had to make use of weird and unique sets in order to bad the victory home. In the final round of the tournament which was played in DW OU, only <a href="/forums/member.php?u=10668">Alice</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=58803">CrashinBoomBang</a>, and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=59679">McMeghan</a> were left standing. Alice picked a team of Thundurus, CrashinBoomBang used a group of Infernape, while McMeghan went with a herd of Keldeo. After many Thunderbolts, Fire Blasts, and Secret Swords, Alice came out on top victorious. Congrats to Alice on your first tournament victory! We hope you'll continue your winning streak! ~sandshrewz</p>

<h2>Victory RoAd ends!</h2>
<h3>Tue 21, Aug 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Victory RoAd, which lasted slightly over a month, saw many hopeful challengers coming in to attempt to defeat all four of our veteran players of the four past generations of Pokemon. <a href="/forums/member.php?u=19">Hipmonlee</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=526">gene</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=73">Loki</a>, and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=15210">Earthworm</a> represented RBY, GSC, ADV, and DPP OU respectively; all of them proved to be quite hard to defeat and fought strongly to prevent anyone from crossing the Victory RoAd. While they proved to be astoundingly difficult to break through, 3 challengers came with 3 wins and were looking to secure their final win to conquer the Victory RoAd. As announced nearly 3 weeks ago, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=21345">M Dragon</a> was the first winner of the Victory RoAd, after a nearly flawless run and losing only once to Hipmonlee. The other two rising challengers were <a href="/forums/member.php?u=1916">Umby</a> and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=1794">Floppy</a>. The former only had to defeat gene while the latter was dramatically trying to down Earthworm. Alas, gene came on top of Umby thanks to a crucial flinch from Rock Slide. Earthworm had an impressive 10 wins against Floppy and sadly for the latter, he lost his closely fought final battle against Earthworm. Their long-awaited final battle concluded the Victory RoAd. Hipmonlee won 8 battles while losing 5; gene had an impressive record of winning 12 and losing only 2&mdash;to M Dragon and Floppy; Loki proved to be a difficult opponent though he was down by 10 matches and only won 7; DPP OU proved to be the most popular as Earthworm bagged 44 wins (a quarter from Floppy) and lost 11. Great job to all of the veteran players! The Victory RoAd served as an avenue to play the past generations of Pokemon while giving an opportunity to play against top past generations players. It showcased the mastery of the different generations of some of the challengers and encouraged others to pick up the older generations as well. Once again, congratulations to M Dragon for being the first and only winner of the Victory RoAd! We hope to see you next time! ~sandshrewz</p>

<p>The Yin-Yang Tournament, hosted by <a href="/forums/member.php?u=42814">ENZ0</a>, challenged users to battle in a different official BW metagame every round (specifically, Ubers, OU, UU, RU, NU, and LC). For the final match-up between <a href="/forums/member.php?u=110102">Zebraiken</a> and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=45152">Omicron</a>, ENZ0 changed the rules a bit: the finalists would duke it out in 5 of the 6 metagames (UU was omitted). The finals themselves were especially heated, as neither Omicron nor Zebraiken had won a tournament in the past.

At the end of the game it seemed that soviet had the upper hand, with his Ghost-Arceus, Mewtwo, and Kyogre pitted against Hugendugen's Darkrai and Scizor. Any last hopes Hugendugen had were dashed when a timely Aura Sphere critical hit from soviet's Mewtwo OHKOed Hugendugen's Scizor, though at that point Hugendugen would've needed a Dark Pulse flinch or critical hit to break through Kyogre.

<h3>Sat 28, July 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>In 2005, after the initial success of Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, Nintendo released their typical updated version of the games - Pokemon Emerald. While this game had a few aesthetic and gameplay updates, one major difference that set it apart from its predecessor was the addition of a certain section of the game, called the Battle Frontier. While everyone and their grandmothers were able to defeat the Pokemon League with their over-levelled starter, the Battle Frontier was another sort of beast; boasting seven “Frontier Brains,” each facility of the Frontier pitted the player with a different challenge, eventually leading to a battle with the Brain him/herself. Each Facility required a great deal of skill, a coherent team (not your over-levelled Blaziken) in most of the facilities, and a great deal of luck on the side of the player. From this concept, the Smogon Frontier was born. The Smogon Frontier pits each challenger against the best of what Smogon has to offer; these chosen Frontier Brains from all around the world represent some of Smogon’s strongest, craftiest, and luckiest players. The challenge is this: are you able to defeat all eleven Frontier Brains, Smogon’s premier players? ~Eraddd</p>

<h2>All Tied Up: WCoP Round 2</h2>
<h3>Sun 22, July 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>The World Cup of Pokemon VII has been off to a close start, with 5 tie breakers in Round 1 alone. Now in Round 2, two match-ups have tied things up once again. Asia and LA have found themselves at an impasse, resulting in a tiebreaker between Eo Ut Mortus and Folgorio. Both players are renowned for their skill in DPP UU, making the competition that much more heated. Who is most able to adapt to the current meta? Keep a close eye out to find the answer! The result of this battle could easily go either way, and WCoP team standings rest with these two players. In a similar vein, USA East and Oceania have found themselves at a stalemate. The results of their match-ups boils down to Lamppost vs. panamaxis, meaning team standings depend on the strength of these two users. With two tiebreakers at once, this is shaping up to be one of the closest WCoPs of all time! Stay tuned for more updates. ~Jellicent</p>

<h2>Unscrupulous Tiering Director Tournament Sign-Ups</h2>
<h3>Fri 13, Jul 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Sign-ups for the Unscrupulous Tiering Director Tournament are now open. Hosted by Eo Ut Mortus, each participant may ban two things from the metagame upon sign-up. Their bans will remain in effect for as long as they are in the tournament, with the banlist being updated at the beginning of each round. Redundancy is allowed, meaning that if enough people ban something, it could stay banned for multiple rounds. This means that the rules of the metagame will change drastically with each round, and will likely produce utterly unique metagames never seen before. Sign-ups are below. ~Tobes</p>

<h2>AM Wins the Smogon All Generation Tournament</h2>
<h3>Fri 13, Jul 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Congratulations to 6A9 Ace Matador, who defeated Earthworm in the finals of the Smogon All Generations Tournament. As the name suggests, competitors in this tournament played best-of-5 matches, with one game in each generation's OU. The first four battles, as shown <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4298264&amp;postcount=79">here</a> were completed quickly. AM took first blood in DPP, where, in a narrow game, AM's Flygon used Fire Punch to drop Earthworm's Skarmory to low enough HP for it to die to Brave Bird recoil. Flygon surivived the attack with 1% HP. Earthworm fought back and won the GSC match, where a timely Fire Blast from Earthworm's Curselax dispatched AM's Skarmory. Body Slam paralysis would then allow him to overcome AM's Miltank and Belly Drum Snorlax, giving Earthworm a clean sweep. Earthworm took the ADV match as well, thanks some luck. AM in turn took RBY, making good use of Reflect / Rest Snorlax and finally getting some luck of his own.</p>

<p>The final match of the set, the BW game (seen <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4317525&amp;postcount=88">here</a>), took place two weeks later. AM's Deoxys-D managed to shut down the Dragon-type portion of Earthworm's offense, allowing AM's Gengar and Jirachi to dismantle Earthworm's remaining Scizor, Lucario, and Terrakion, with a timely Focus Blast crit from Gengar against Earthworm's Scizor cementing AM's victory. ~Tobes</p>

<h2>McMeghan wins the Best of 3 Tournament!</h2>
<h3>Wed 11, Jul 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Congratulations to McMeghan, for winning the second iteration of the Best of 3 Tournament! In this tournament, battlers played in a format similar to previous Smogon Tour Top 16's, with competitors playing one game each of BW OU, BW Ubers, and BW UU. As the name of the tournament implies, the player who won a game in two out of three metagames would advance. McMeghan defeated Eo Ut Mortus first in UU, as seen <a href="http://pokemon.aesoft.org/replay-Eo-Ut-Mortus-vs-McMeghan--10-juillet-2012-at-23h36-private1962786621">here</a>, by Baton Passing multiple Quiver Dances to a Mew. McMeghan then took the Ubers match, as seen <a href="http://pokemon.aesoft.org/replay-Eo-Ut-Mortus-vs-McMeghan--10-juillet-2012-at-23h54-private1312145432">here</a>, when a rather unique Giratina-O set shredded Eo's team, allowing a Choice Scarf Terrakion to mop up. With McMeghan already having won two games, there was no need for the OU match.</p>

Each match consists of a battle of three: BW OU, DPP OU, and ADV OU.</p>

<h2>Mirror Match II Tournament Signups Are Open!</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if team advantage was completely removed, and the primary factor deciding games was player skill? The Mirror Match II Tournament allows you to design the team that you will be able to master better than your opponent, and tests your ability to adapt to the creations of others. Each round, players compete in a best-of-three set, once with each player using the first player's team, once with both using the second player's team, and once with both using a team posted by the host each round. In its previous renditions, players pulled out all the stops, developing increasingly creative teams in the hope that their opponents would be at the disadvantage. One of the finalists even used a team consisting of six Espeon! Sign up for this tournament to try your hand at mirror matches! ~Steven Snype</p>

<h2>The No Johns Tournament</h2>
<h3>Sat 23, Jun 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Sign-ups for the No Johns Tournament have opened! Hosted by Bloo, this tournament harkens back to the days of 4th gen DPP OU, where Rotom formes are Ghost-types and Salamence is banned. Fun fact: the etymology of the word "John" comes from Smash, denoting a "cheap excuse" for any unfavourable event; in pokemon, "johning" means to avoid a match for whatever reason. Thus, in a tournament called "No John" the deadlines will be extremely short, up to only three days, so make sure you finish your matches! The format for this tournament is standard; general tournament rules and standard DPP OU rules apply, except for one catch: each match is a <strong>best of one</strong>, rather than a best of three. With these things in mind, hurry up and sign up and prove yourself in one of Smogon's most successful and popular metagames, and remember, no johning! ~Eraddd</p>

<h2>The Battle Royale Act IV &mdash; Closing up!</h2>
<h3>Sat 23, Jun 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>With the Battle Royale Act IV coming to a close, we see the player McMeghan rise triumphantly amongst the corpses of his fellow battlers. This tournament had a rather unique format, using the movie "Battle Royale" as an inspiration. In a span of two weeks, 42 battlers duelled in a free-for-all tournament, where players challenged each other to the death (or best of one), until only one victor was left standing. If a winner hadn't been decided within the two weeks, then everyone would have been eliminated instead. Fortunately, the final match was fought with McMeghan on one side, and 6A9 Ace Matador on the other, with McMeghan as the winner. Congratulations to him for a great performance, and we hope to see you in the next installment of Battle Royale! ~Eraddd</p>
