    <h2>BlankZero and Alf wins the Doubles Doubles tournament!</h2>
    <h3>Thur 7, Nov 2013</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Hosted by <a href="/forums/members/136301/">Audiosurfer</a>, the Doubles Doubles tournament consisted of tag-teams that were randomly generated at the start of the tour. As the name suggests, the matches were played in the Doubles metagame format. In the final round, Team 25 (<a href="/forums/members/126859/">cbt</a> and <a href="/forums/members/178647/">CBKyogre</a>) and Team 7 (<a href="/forums/members/156102/">BlankZero</a> <a href=''/forums/members/81221/">Alf</a>) battled against each other. CBKyogre defeated BlankZero in their match, but cbt lost to Alf, which left CBKyogre and Alf's match as the tiebreaker. While it was a close and intense game, Alf defeated CBKyogre, giving Team 7 the win. Congratulations to both teams for making it to such an exciting finals! ~Governess</p>

        <p>Also part of the Smogon Grand Slam, this tournament had players battle in standard Ubers each round in a best-of-3 format, being hosted by <a href="/forums/members/furai.50612">Furai</a> after the original host, former Ubers leader <a href="/forums/members/bojangles.20796">bojangles</a>, quit Smogon. The final bout for top Uberer was between <a href="/forums/members/bad-ass.28700">Bad Ass</a> and <a href="/forums/members/ciele.39327">Ciele</a>, both reaching it without playing a single semifinal game, caused by scheduling issues and a ghosting controversy that led to several users receiving 2 month tournament bans, respectively. In <a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/replay/oriserver-gen5ubers-53909">Game 1</a>, both players used offensive teams, but badass came out on top by cleaning up with Deoxys-A in the endgame, helped in part by a lategame misplay by Ciele. In <a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/replay/oriserver-gen5ubers-53912">Game 2</a>, both players brought offense once again, but smart plays allowed badass to win yet again, clinching him the victory.

    <h2>Dice wins the RU Open II!</h2>
    <h3>Sat 5, October 2013</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Hosted by the RU tier leader, <a href="/forums/members/40358/">Oglemi</a>, the second incarnation of the prestigious RU Open has finally came to a close. Many players have gathered to see who would claim the title of an RU champ, and in the end it boiled down to <a href="/forums/members/29254/">Bloo</a>, the Head Tournament Director, <a href="/forums/members/126615/">Dice</a>, a well-know tournament participant, and <a href="/forums/members/192267/">Wepwnemon</a>, an esteemed RU player. The finals starts off with Dice defeating Wepwnemon 2-0, giving Dice the advantage so far. The next match was between Bloo and Dice; if Dice won, he would become the RU Open II winner. The first battle was tight, and both players made very smart predictions in terms of who to switch in and out into. However, a SubSalac Scolipede on Dice's team was the icing on the cake, sweeping the remaining half of Bloo's team. In the second match, it was also a very close match; Bloo was left with a paralyzed +1 Speed Kabutops as his remaining Pokemon against Dice's team of three. While it was very promising, an unwanted paralysis fell upon Kabutops, which ultimately gave Dice the win. Congratulations to Dice as the champion of the RU Open II, Bloo and Wepwnemon for making it to the finals, and Oglemi for hosting the tournament! ~Governess</p>

        <p>The 8th edition of the Smogon Frontier recently concluded, and despite the fact that no normal challenger managed to conquer the 13 brains within 30 days, the brains themselves were allowed to challenge their fellow brains for a short period of time after the 30 day period. Most declined, but Tower Tycoon <a href="/forums/members/reyscarface.27854">reyscarface</a> decided to take on his fellow brains. 12 days later, a new holder of the coveted green trophy was crowned. Rey defeated Pike Queen <a href="/forums/members/soulwind.64874">SoulWind</a> in the <a href="http://pastebin.com/WfW24uVN">decisive match</a>.

        <p>Hosted by <a href="/forums/members/57965">Lady Salamence</a> and <a href="/forums/members/172456">GemOftheDay</a>, the Salary Cap Tournament showcases an interesting concept in the way of 64 handpicked participants having to draft Pokemon for use on their teams. Each participant has $80,000 to spend and may pick a maximum of 10 Pokemon for use, with minimum bids and Pokemon availability decreasing with the higher tiers. For example, the minimum bid for Politoed is 10k, but there are 5 Politoed available between all the players, making lower tier Pokemon useful for the reasons shown earlier.

Now it is making its first foray into the Tournaments forum, with the tournament being hosted by Tier Shift’s creator, PureQuestion. Tier Shift is similar to standard BW2 OU, but it has a twist to it: each of the base stats of all UU, RU, and NU Pokemon are raised by 5, 10, and 15 points, respectively. This turns Pokemon such as Golurk and Stoutland into formidable threats that must be prepared for, as well as many other lower-tier Pokemon.

        <p> Congratulations to undisputed, the winner of DPP Fest, a tournament with a format that goes back to the days of Shoddy Battle&mdash;a best-of-3 tournament with matches in DPP OU, DPP UU, and DPP Ubers without Arceus. Congratulations should also go to Eo Ut Mortus for reaching the finals of a tournament which I have no doubts was extremely difficult due to the nature of DPP, but the main congratulations go to undisputed for taking the entire thing, netting him his third tournament win aside Smogon Tours and team-based tournaments. ~Lady Salamence</p>

         <p>As we all know, RBY was the best generation. Best sprites (Golbat), best design (Magneton), best mechanics (Focus Energy), et cetra. What could make RBY even better? Making it a bit more competitive. By introducing a loophole in the trading system, moves that were learned in GSC by Gen 1 Pokémon could be send back to the original games, to be used. Princess Bri made a tournament out of it, where people would make competitive RBY teams using the glitch and battle with them. As RBY was the best&mdash;just ask any people that were around for it, it's bound to be a good tournament! Hurry and sign up! ~Lady Salamence</p>

        <p>As Smogon Premier League heads into its second week of official tournament play, the competition is heating up. Veteran battler <a href="/forums/member.php?u=32772">Windsong</a> is on the tournament scene and is ready to share his predictions on how one of the best match-ups is going to shake out. See who he picked as the favored team in the tough war waged between defending champions Alpha Ruiners and the 25-man gaggle that is the Team Raiders. Can the Raiders take advantage of the Ruiners' lapse in concentration against the Tigers to pull the upset? Or will the Ruiners get back into the groove and maintain the throne? Come see what Windsong thinks of it all in this week's Highlight Team Matchup! ~Birkal</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Congratulations to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=52012">BKC</a> for winning the second #pokemon Tournament. In this tournament, players are assigned pre-compiled teams (the list can be seen <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3474089">here</a>. BKC defeated <a href="/forums/member.php?u=14109">Nachos</a> to win the tournament, and subsequently earn ops in #pokemon. The games that BKC won can be seen <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4459028&amp;postcount=42">here</a>; in Game 1 BKC used a sand stall team relying on Stoutland to mop up weakened teams, while Nachos was using a rain offense team designed to take advantage of Deoxys-D's entry hazards and build up damage with offensive pressure and timely U-turns. Both sides traded luck throughout the game, but eventually BKC's Heatran pulled through and finished off Nachos's Scizor and Spore'd Politoed. In Game 3 BKC used a similar team to the one he used in Game 1, while Nachos used full Baton Pass. Expert Belt Genesect made quick work of Nachos, though: Nachos attempted to Baton Pass from Vaporeon to Mr. Mime, which ate a Thunderbolt. Nachos attempted to use Substitute, but apparently Mr. Mime had not received enough Speed boosts from Ninjask, and was outpaced and left with too little HP to successfully create the Substitute, resulting in its death next turn. Genesect mopped things up from there, as Nachos's last-ditch Ninjask Flash didn't pay off. Congratulations BKC. ~Tobes</p>

    <h2>MarceloDK Wins the From Start To Finish Tournament</h2>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>From Start To Finish, hosted by <a href="/forums/member.php?u=1668">Giga Punch</a>, is a tournament with the best-of-three format including GSC OU, ADV OU, and DPP OU except that all matches will be played with Team Preview. This meant that many tactics that relied on the surprise factor of keeping your Pokemon unrevealed no longer worked. The finals came down to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=59925">MarceloDK</a> and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=79509">Ojama</a>. Both of the finalists displayed good sportmanship when they had to restart their GSC OU match countless times due to an accidental illegal move by Ojama followed by MarceloDK disconnecting after they remade their moves. It took several more restarts before they could finally recreate their match such that both players agreed on. Still, Ojama's Growth and Acid Amor Vaporeon paved the way for a sweep, till MarceloDK's Miltank landed a critical hit on the 40% HP Vaporeon. Ojama took the win by destroying MarceloDK's second last Pokemon with a Thunder from Zapdos and the former's Snorlax Selfdestructed on the remaining Miltank.</p>

        <p>However, MarceloDK rebounded back on ADV OU with an odd Toxic Dragon Dance Tyranitar but missed Toxic on Ojama's Swampert. It was compensated by a critical hit Rock Slide and flinch after Swampert activated Tyranitar's Liechi Berry with an Earthquake. MarceloDK bagged the win when Ojama sent in his Calm Mind Jirachi against the former's Calm Mind + Roar Suicune. DPP OU ended in a similar fashion after several Sleep Powder misses from Ojama's Roserade. MarceloDK's Heatran managed to sweep Ojama's weakened team with just Lava Plume; Ojama's Calm Mind Jirachi failed to wall Heatran after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes combined with a burn from Lava Plume that sealed the match. Although there were plenty of misses and critical hits on both sides,  neither player claimed that they were overly determinative of the  outcome. Congratulations MarceloDK! ~sandshrewz</p>

    <h2>papai noel Wins the Unscrupulous Tournament Director Tournament</h2>
    <h3>Wed 10, Oct 2012</h3>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Congratulations to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=145572">papai noel</a> for beating out <a href="/forums/member.php?u=58803">CrashinBoomBang</a> to win the Unscrupulous Tiering Director Tournament. In this tournament, the banlist for standard OU was constructed from two ban submissions sent in by every user; when a player lost, his or her bans were removed from the banlist (a ban could be submitted by multiple users for duplicity). CrashinBoomBang banned the ubiquitous Stealth Rock and Spikes, a wise and direct incision to remove the cancers of OU, while papai noel took a more esoteric, nay, ethereal approach and banned Dragonite and Tentacruel. As papai noel won, his tiering decisions have clearly proven superior, as was the point of this tournament. Tentacruel, you're on watch.</p>

<p>Onto the battle itself (the log can be seen <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4425953&amp;postcount=31">here</a>): CrashinBoomBang gained an early advantage by effectively eliminating papai noel's Tyranitar with his Choice Band Dugtrio. Choice Band could be seen as an odd choice of item for Dugtrio in a metagame where Toxic Spikes is the only entry hazard, meaning Focus Sash's effectiveness is nearly guaranteed, but CrashinBoomBang's item decision is understandable when taking into account his own Abomasnow's hail. On top of winning the weather war early, CrashinBoomBang's advantage was further pushed when his Alakazam OHKOed papai noel's Rotom-W with a critical hit Psychic. Hax would quickly balance itself though, as Alakazam missed its second Focus Blast against papai noel's specially defensive Heatran, allowing Heatran to finish off Alakazam with Lava Plume. From there, papai noel was able to make a major push with Calm Mind Latias, tanking a Cloyster's Icicle Spear, which gave papai noel's Sheer Force Landorus free reign to finish off CrashinBoomBang's Choice Scarf Magnezone and take the game. Congratulations papai noel. ~Tobes</p>

<h2>MikeDecIsHere wins Showdown! Randbats Tournament</h2>
<h3>Wed 5, Sep 2012</h3>

<p>Initially hosted by <a href="/forums/member.php?u=73120">Steamroll</a> and then passed over to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=27854">reyscarface</a>, it eventually fell into the care of Tournament Director <a href="/forums/member.php?u=29254">Bloo</a>. The best of three tournament featured the Randbats battle format unique to the Pokemon Showdown! simulator, the official simulator of Smogon. Randbats is similar to Challenge Cup in the sense that the Pokemon you get is random, but the Pokemon are given more useful moves, items, and natures, giving Randbats some competitive value. Randbats is a quick way to past time if you wish to play something competitive but do not want to make a team; it's also pretty popular in Pokemon Showndown! and it isn't hard to find a match. The tournament came down to a Showdown! between <a href="/forums/member.php?u=81221">DarkLoïc</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=3482">jrrrrrrr</a>, and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=63038">MikeDecIsHere</a>. Luck, or rather RNG, favored MikeDecIsHere and allowed him to trounce jrrrrrrr 2-0. However, MikeDecIsHere got frozen twice in his match against DarkLoïc which eventually led him to ragequit that match. Nonetheless, he still managed to defeat DarkLoïc for a 2-1. Congratulations to MikeDecIsHere! If you're itching to play Randbats, head down to <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/lobby">Pokemon Showdown!</a> now but beware of the infamous Air Balloon Rotom-S. ~sandshrewz</p>

<h2>Garchomp in the Smogon Tour?</h2>
<h3>Sat 1, Sep 2012</h3>

<p>Tournament Director <a href="/forums/member.php?u=16630">Kevin Garrett</a> has recently announced something in <a href="/forums/showthread.php?t=3471600">this thread</a> that shook the entire <a href="/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=203">Overused forum</a>. The final set of practice tours will feature a suspect test. That is to say, Rough Skin Garchomp is allowed in the practice tournaments while Sand Veil is banned. This means that every Pokemon with the Sand Veil ability must use another ability as all of them have an alternative ability. Kevin Garrett also said that the results of this suspect test will be scrutinized by the OU Council; could this mean that there's a possibility of Garchomp being released back into OU? Perhaps. Either way, please remember to pack your Garchomps for the pratice tours and maybe even employ the old DragMag strategy! There's also a suspect ladder on <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/lobby">Pokemon Showdown!</a> for you to test out and play in a metagame with Garchomp released back into OU. In case you're wondering, the last two practice tours for the Smogon Tour will be held today 4 PM, EDT and tomorrow 2 PM EDT on Pokemon Showdown!

<h2>Victory RoAd ends!</h2>
<h3>Tue 21, Aug 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Victory RoAd, which lasted slightly over a month, saw many hopeful challengers coming in to attempt to defeat all four of our veteran players of the four past generations of Pokemon. <a href="/forums/member.php?u=19">Hipmonlee</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=526">gene</a>, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=73">Loki</a>, and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=15210">Earthworm</a> represented RBY, GSC, ADV, and DPP OU respectively; all of them proved to be quite hard to defeat and fought strongly to prevent anyone from crossing the Victory RoAd. While they proved to be astoundingly difficult to break through, 3 challengers came with 3 wins and were looking to secure their final win to conquer the Victory RoAd. As announced nearly 3 weeks ago, <a href="/forums/member.php?u=21345">M Dragon</a> was the first winner of the Victory RoAd, after a nearly flawless run and losing only once to Hipmonlee. The other two rising challengers were <a href="/forums/member.php?u=1916">Umby</a> and <a href="/forums/member.php?u=1794">Floppy</a>. The former only had to defeat gene while the latter was dramatically trying to down Earthworm. Alas, gene came on top of Umby thanks to a crucial flinch from Rock Slide. Earthworm had an impressive 10 wins against Floppy and sadly for the latter, he lost his closely fought final battle against Earthworm. Their long-awaited final battle concluded the Victory RoAd. Hipmonlee won 8 battles while losing 5; gene had an impressive record of winning 12 and losing only 2&mdash;to M Dragon and Floppy; Loki proved to be a difficult opponent though he was down by 10 matches and only won 7; DPP OU proved to be the most popular as Earthworm bagged 44 wins (a quarter from Floppy) and lost 11. Great job to all of the veteran players! The Victory RoAd served as an avenue to play the past generations of Pokemon while giving an opportunity to play against top past generations players. It showcased the mastery of the different generations of some of the challengers and encouraged others to pick up the older generations as well. Once again, congratulations to M Dragon for being the first and only winner of the Victory RoAd! We hope to see you next time! ~sandshrewz</p>

Will any pair become a formidable duo overnight and prove to be strong force in the tournament? Will new friendships be born or broken? Keep an eye out for this tournament to witness spectacular teamwork, or the opposite. ~sandshrewz</p>

<h2>US West Wins the WCOP</h2>
<h3>Thu 16, Aug 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>With the conclusion of the 2012 Olympics, it seems the US squeezed out another victory to bring glory to (one part of) their nation yet again. With Bloo defeating idiotfrommars, this last victory vaulted the US West into their first World Cup of Pokemon championship, ending the reign of the three-time champ Oceania. Coming up as runner-ups in last year's World Cup of Pokemon, the US West stormed back into the finals, led by their stalwart yet prickly captain, Scofield and defeated US East, led by Stone_Cold, by a comfortable margin of 5 to 2. Congratulations to the US West for their victory this year and also a shout out to all those who participated this year. ~Eraddd</p>

<p>Congratulations to <a href="/forums/member.php?u=57040">soviet</a>, AKA ban nattorei, for winning the BW Ubers Tournament. soviet defeated <a href="/forums/member.php?u=32362">Hugendugen</a>, as seen <a href="http://pokemon.aesoft.org/replay-soviet-vs-Hugendugen--2012-08-14">here</a>. soviet created offensive pressure throughout the match with Deoxys-A, Ghost-Arceus, Choice Specs Ogre, and Rayquaza. At the end of the game it seemed that soviet had the upper hand, with his Ghost-Arceus, Mewtwo, and Kyogre pitted against Hugendugen's Darkrai and Scizor. Any last hopes Hugendugen had were dashed when a timely Aura Sphere critical hit from soviet's Mewtwo OHKOed Hugendugen's Scizor, though at that point Hugendugen would've needed a Dark Pulse flinch or critical hit to break through Kyogre. Congratulations to soviet. ~Tobes</p>

Through conservative play he was then able to stall out Lucario and Terrakion with Skarmory, dispatching both with a Brave Bird after they had taken repeated hazard damage and suffered from Close Combat defense drops. This allowed Limitless to pick off a severely weakened last-Pokemon Salamence with Lucario's ExtremeSpeed. Congratulations Limitless! ~Tobes</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Smogon Frontier!</h2>
<h3>Sat 28, July 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>In 2005, after the initial success of Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, Nintendo released their typical updated version of the games - Pokemon Emerald. While this game had a few aesthetic and gameplay updates, one major difference that set it apart from its predecessor was the addition of a certain section of the game, called the Battle Frontier. While everyone and their grandmothers were able to defeat the Pokemon League with their over-levelled starter, the Battle Frontier was another sort of beast; boasting seven “Frontier Brains,” each facility of the Frontier pitted the player with a different challenge, eventually leading to a battle with the Brain him/herself. Each Facility required a great deal of skill, a coherent team (not your over-levelled Blaziken) in most of the facilities, and a great deal of luck on the side of the player. From this concept, the Smogon Frontier was born. The Smogon Frontier pits each challenger against the best of what Smogon has to offer; these chosen Frontier Brains from all around the world represent some of Smogon’s strongest, craftiest, and luckiest players. The challenge is this: are you able to defeat all eleven Frontier Brains, Smogon’s premier players? ~Eraddd</p>

Both players are renowned for their skill in DPP UU, making the competition that much more heated. Who is most able to adapt to the current meta? Keep a close eye out to find the answer! The result of this battle could easily go either way, and WCoP team standings rest with these two players. In a similar vein, USA East and Oceania have found themselves at a stalemate. The results of their match-ups boils down to Lamppost vs. panamaxis, meaning team standings depend on the strength of these two users.

The first four battles, as shown <a href="/forums/showpost.php?p=4298264&amp;postcount=79">here</a> were completed quickly. AM took first blood in DPP, where, in a narrow game, AM's Flygon used Fire Punch to drop Earthworm's Skarmory to low enough HP for it to die to Brave Bird recoil. Flygon surivived the attack with 1% HP. Earthworm fought back and won the GSC match, where a timely Fire Blast from Earthworm's Curselax dispatched AM's Skarmory. Body Slam paralysis would then allow him to overcome AM's Miltank and Belly Drum Snorlax, giving Earthworm a clean sweep. Earthworm took the ADV match as well, thanks some luck. AM in turn took RBY, making good use of Reflect / Rest Snorlax and finally getting some luck of his own.</p>

AM's Deoxys-D managed to shut down the Dragon-type portion of Earthworm's offense, allowing AM's Gengar and Jirachi to dismantle Earthworm's remaining Scizor, Lucario, and Terrakion, with a timely Focus Blast crit from Gengar against Earthworm's Scizor cementing AM's victory. ~Tobes</p>

<h2>Team PANELAND wins the Ghosting Tournament!</h2>
<h3>Thu 12, Jul 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Congratulations to Team PANELAND for winning the Ghosting Tournament! In this tournament, a team was <em>encouraged</em> to give their players advice during a match, something that is normally taboo. Team PANELAND, consisting of Hantsuki, pi face, and Rurushu, went up against Team SCHLÜSSELBEINBRUCH, whose members were Django Reinhart, CrashinBoomBang, and Ginku. In a battle that lasted over three hours, as seen <a href="http://pokemon.aesoft.org/replay-Django-vs-Rurushu--11-julho-2012-at-22h32-private2074077128">here</a> (don't worry the replay isn't nearly as long), Rurushu and his teammates managed to defeat Django Reinhart and his team. Congratulations to Rurushu, Hantsuki, and pi face!</p>

<p>For those interested in the ghosting process, a full (translated) log of Team PANELAND's decision-making process can be found <a href="http://pastebin.com/LumyKjyC">here</a>. ~Tobes</p>

<h2>McMeghan wins the Best of 3 Tournament!</h2>
<h3>Wed 11, Jul 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Congratulations to McMeghan, for winning the second iteration of the Best of 3 Tournament! In this tournament, battlers played in a format similar to previous Smogon Tour Top 16's, with competitors playing one game each of BW OU, BW Ubers, and BW UU. As the name of the tournament implies, the player who won a game in two out of three metagames would advance. McMeghan defeated Eo Ut Mortus first in UU, as seen <a href="http://pokemon.aesoft.org/replay-Eo-Ut-Mortus-vs-McMeghan--10-juillet-2012-at-23h36-private1962786621">here</a>, by Baton Passing multiple Quiver Dances to a Mew. McMeghan then took the Ubers match, as seen <a href="http://pokemon.aesoft.org/replay-Eo-Ut-Mortus-vs-McMeghan--10-juillet-2012-at-23h54-private1312145432">here</a>, when a rather unique Giratina-O set shredded Eo's team, allowing a Choice Scarf Terrakion to mop up. With McMeghan already having won two games, there was no need for the OU match.</p>

<p>Congratulations McMeghan! ~Tobes</p>

<h2>The Kind of a BIGger Deal Tournament</h2>
<h3>Sat 7, Jul 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>The clash of the best players--it's kind of a BIGger deal than maybe even the shiny official Smogon tournament trophies. The users in the top 32 of Smogon Tour records were offered places in this tournament, and those who opted out were replaced with equally skilled players. Each match consists of a battle of three: BW OU, DPP OU, and ADV OU.</p>

<p>There are a two things that stick out with this tournament. First, BW OU will not be with the changes of BW2. Second of all, spectators <em>must</em> be allowed, and, in fact, are encouraged. So, stalk your favorites, place your bets, and check the thread for updates! ~V0x</p>

<h2>Mirror Match II Tournament Signups Are Open!</h2>
<h3>Sun 1, July 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if team advantage was completely removed, and the primary factor deciding games was player skill? The Mirror Match II Tournament allows you to design the team that you will be able to master better than your opponent, and tests your ability to adapt to the creations of others. Each round, players compete in a best-of-three set, once with each player using the first player's team, once with both using the second player's team, and once with both using a team posted by the host each round. In its previous renditions, players pulled out all the stops, developing increasingly creative teams in the hope that their opponents would be at the disadvantage. One of the finalists even used a team consisting of six Espeon! Sign up for this tournament to try your hand at mirror matches! ~Steven Snype</p>

<h2>The Inaugural BW2 OU Tournament Signups Are Open!</h2>
<h3>Sun 1, July 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>In the wake of a new metagame, there's no better way to raise the excitement than with a tournament. Hosted by Iconic, signups opened earlier today and will remain so for another 48 hours. With new threats, tutor moves, and maybe even tiering changes within the lifetime of the tournament, will the vapid VoltTurn strategy continue to dominate, or will a lone trainer craft the devastating set that breaks one of these new Pokemon? Whatever the case may be, sign up now and abuse Salac Berry, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and the whole slew of new Dream World abilities! ~V0x</p>

<h2>The No Johns Tournament</h2>
<h3>Sat 23, Jun 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Sign-ups for the No Johns Tournament have opened! Hosted by Bloo, this tournament harkens back to the days of 4th gen DPP OU, where Rotom formes are Ghost-types and Salamence is banned. Fun fact: the etymology of the word "John" comes from Smash, denoting a "cheap excuse" for any unfavourable event; in pokemon, "johning" means to avoid a match for whatever reason. Thus, in a tournament called "No John" the deadlines will be extremely short, up to only three days, so make sure you finish your matches! The format for this tournament is standard; general tournament rules and standard DPP OU rules apply, except for one catch: each match is a <strong>best of one</strong>, rather than a best of three. With these things in mind, hurry up and sign up and prove yourself in one of Smogon's most successful and popular metagames, and remember, no johning! ~Eraddd</p>

<h2>The Adherence Tournament &mdash; New round!</h2>
<h3>Sat 23, Jun 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>Round 2 of the Adherence Tournament has just begun! Set in BW OU, this tournament has one simple rule: each pokemon must be equipped with a Choice item. This means that prediction and team building are even more crucial in this format; can you prevail in these restricting conditions? This year's tournament features the return of Heist, last year's winner, and the likes of Iconic, McMeghan, and other heavyweights. Round 1 featured some upsets such as reyscarface, and idiotfrommars suffering from defeats at the hands of Living Things and IceCarAdler respectively. Will Heist claim his crown yet again? Or will someone else claim the top for themselves this year? ~Eraddd</p>

<h2>The Battle Royale Act IV &mdash; Closing up!</h2>
<h3>Sat 23, Jun 2012</h3>

<div class="entry">
<p>With the Battle Royale Act IV coming to a close, we see the player McMeghan rise triumphantly amongst the corpses of his fellow battlers. This tournament had a rather unique format, using the movie "Battle Royale" as an inspiration. In a span of two weeks, 42 battlers duelled in a free-for-all tournament, where players challenged each other to the death (or best of one), until only one victor was left standing. If a winner hadn't been decided within the two weeks, then everyone would have been eliminated instead. Fortunately, the final match was fought with McMeghan on one side, and 6A9 Ace Matador on the other, with McMeghan as the winner. Congratulations to him for a great performance, and we hope to see you in the next installment of Battle Royale! ~Eraddd</p>
