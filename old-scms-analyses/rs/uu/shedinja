[Overview]

<p>Shedinja is good only in the Uber environment. In the standard metagame 100% counters such as Tyranitar's Sand Stream and Spikes are used. In the Uber metagame, many things such as Kyogre and Latios lack the moves to hurt Shedinja, allowing it to deal lots of damage. However, with the fairly recent commonness of Spikes and Toxic on everything, even then Shedinja is risky. If you don't carry Rapid Spin and the ability to change the weather (either Rain Dance or Sunny Day... or Drizzle and Drought), don't use Shedinja. Shedinja is generally too risky to be your only counter to something, because of how easily things can stop it.</p>

<p>Basically slug away with Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Bug, or Swords Dance if the opponent is foolish and tries to stat up himself. Protect is for checking movesets since unpredictable movesets will end Shedinja in one move, so something odd carrying Toxic will spell the end of your days. Spikes, Sandstorm and what not will also end Shedinja, so it's pretty risky to use. If you are afraid of going for the stat-upping variant, you can just pick Silver Wind and Hidden Power Rock, seeing as in Uber (where this is most commonly seen), it can hurt a lot of Pokémon. By all means watch out for Metagross.</p>

<p>This is the Choice Banding variant. It's a lot riskier than the Protect Shedinja, but you can hurt a lot more stuff with this moveset. It's up to you. If you want to take a big risk, you can net a big reward. Or you can also lose this baby much easier. Choice Band is a good choice for Shedinja because you have to play it like one, anyway. Just bring it in on stuff that can't hurt it, and hit their switch hard. You'll invariably switch out next turn, really, as if they switch, they switch to something that can damage Shedinja. Hidden Power Ground is for Metagross, Hidden Power Fighting is for Tyranitar. As Metagross is more common in ubers, that is a real option, but in standard, Tyranitar is the most common, and most obvious switch when they know you have Shedinja. Although Shedinja will die next turn, Hidden Power Fighting will do massive damage, if not deal a KO, so it's a kind of kamikaze move. Toxic is also used mostly for uber matches, so Shedinja can actually do something to guys like Groudon and Rayquaza. Aerial Ace is for fighters, meaning purely Heracross, really, so Sleep Talk is a good option, considering how few sleepers have a move that hits Shedinja.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Confuse Ray and Toxic, mainly. These can be very annoying and can help wear down whatever your opponent switches in to counter Shedinja with.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Adamant with 252 in Attack and Speed. You won't need anything else.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Spikes, Sandstorm / Sand Stream and Toxic / Leech Seed are sure fire counters. Other than that, Fire, Rock, Flying, Ghost and Dark moves will kill Shedinja in one hit regardless of the move's Base Power. Pursuit on something bulky like Metagross is the best attack counter.</p>
