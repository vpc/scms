[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Paralyze a Pokémon, and try to predict a Focus Punch to the switch to Clefable. Reflect or Light Screen helps with defense if you predict they will switch in a Ground Pokémon... but if you don't like that, stick with a Hidden Power to hurt Ground-types. Hidden Power Grass hits Quagsire (and the rare Whiscash), while Hidden Power Ice hits Grass-types and things like Altaria in UU.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter works great with his defenses and HP. Fire Punch works for Steelix, who is a common Ampharos counter in BL-allowed UU matches, as well as a little more damage on Grassers. Heal Bell also works on Ampharos in UU, as Focus Punch isn't particularly useful there (it only hits Kangaskhan, really), or you can drop Thunder Wave.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pretty much the same type of Pokémon wall and counter Ampharos, such as Quagsire and Meganium. Muk could also be used to switch into it as it has massive HP and good Special Defense. Grumpig and Hypno could annoy it with their high Special Defense, too.</p>
