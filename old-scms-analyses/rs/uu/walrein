[Overview]

<p>This is a great alternative to Blastoise and Quagsire in UU, thanks to STAB on Ice Beam, but in an OU game, it's inferior to Lapras, except the Curse set, which is a weaker Swampert. This is one of the most contested UUs, with some respected UU players recommending it be moved to BL due to its ability to tank hits, if that is any indication of its power.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This thing never dies. Hidden Power Grass is used for other Waters, primarily Quagsire, but Toxic stops the ever common Hypno and Grumpig switches. Ice Beam has STAB and is a generally great attacking type. The defense allows it to switch into even Choice Band Gligar Earthquakes and Rock Slides, and then scare it off with STAB Ice Beam. Surf is another option in the last slot, as it also gets STAB and hits stuff like Aggron.</p>

[SET]
name: Encore
move 1: Ice Beam

move 3: Encore
move 4: Surf / Rest
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 136 Def / 120 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You COULD use Rest here, Surf is probably more effective. At least try to Toxic a few things before you die. Encore can be useful to stop Cursers or paralyzed enemies, because otherwise, Walrein is usually too slow to really Encore effectively. A lot of people forget Walrein can Encore, though, so they might try and set up on you.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers
nature: Sassy
evs: 224 HP / 216 Atk / 52 SpA / 16 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Walrein can Curse decently if you are into that stuff. You will want to hit Electrics on the switch or you will be in trouble later on. Ice Beam hits Solrock and Misdreavus for decent damage and with STAB absolutely trashes Altaria. Offensively, Ground and Ice are a very powerful combination. Electabuzz and Manectric are your two biggest enemies here, so you have to try and catch them on the switch with Earthquake. You might not want to give away Curse and Earthquake at first, to lull the Electrics into a false sense of security, and then BAM! Earthquake KO.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It can Roar semi-effectively, but there is little to phaze in UU except Grumpig. Icy Wind can stop sweepers with its Speed lowering capabilities. Yawn gives Walrein a phazing move.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For the Cursing version you will want a good amount of Attack and Special Defense. For the others you might want to concentrate on Defense to take Gligar on. No matter what this won't take on Hitmonlee or other Pokémon with STAB Fighting attacks, so don't even bother (Surf scares away a lot of the Pokémon with Rock attacks). You can't go wrong with some Special Attack; STAB Ice Beam is very threatening. The Encore set uses a bunch of Special Defense to help it take on Calm Mind Pokémon better, but if you want to boost another stat, take it from there first.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Snorlax can take its hits all day and rest off the damage, or Curse up with it and win the match up (barring a critical hit) with STAB Normal, Swampert just overpowers it, any Water with Toxic beats Restless versions, Electric Pokémon especially Manectric and Electabuzz make it run, but sometimes have to worry about Earthquake on the switch. Hitmonlee absorbs hits with its huge Special Defense and unleashes STAB Fighting attacks. Hypno beats Walrein without Toxic. Water Absorb Quagsire can overpower those without Hidden Power Grass, but doesn't like being Toxiced.</p>
