[Overview]

<p>Feraligatr is actually a pretty good Pokémon overall, it's pretty diverse and doesn't really have any bad stats. Always an unexpected surprise in the UU environment, particularly since your foe will not know what the crocodile will throw at you!</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It's hard to believe that something this ugly is the forgotten one of all the starters. Well, those stats are a cut above most UU Pokémon, and, despite the fact that they are not really in the right places, you will find the crocodile to be a useful part of your UU team. He has good staying power, and can hit pretty hard.</p>

<p>It's basically your standard physical sweeper, Earthquake and Hidden Power Flying are an attempt to cover its two weaknesses, Sword Dance to boost them, and Hydro Pump to hit the Pokémon with higher Defense, scoring an easier kill on Sandslash, Golem and friends. Rock Slide is probably more traditional on a physical sweeper like this, but I normally go with Hidden Power Flying. He should be able to get a Swords Dance in, and he's not THAT slow, so he should be able to score a fair few good hits.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In UU this might be good, seeing as Feraligatr has pretty decent stats for that environment.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hey, some people have pulled off a successful special Gyarados, and if he can do it, Feraligatr can (might) be able to, too! It is definitely unexpected, and that Special Attack isn't awful, and it's got a fair few special attacks there (Crunch and Dragon Claw too), so it's always up for consideration. Brick Break is there, of course, and if you don't like Swords Dance, you can go for a choice band set if you really want. Counter is somewhat unexpected on this Pokémon, so it's a possible choice. Screech at the very least forces a switch, or else let you totally destroy your foe.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For the first moveset you will want to max out that Attack, put a fair few into Speed, and dump the rest into HP. Its defenses are pretty good for the most part anyway. And maybe some into Special Attack to back Hydro Pump up a bit. Go Adamant or Brave. For the second one you'll want to split your EVs like you would for Gengar and Swampert.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>This big brute will survive weaker Electric and Grass attacks, but I wouldn't push your luck. It is a fair balanced Pokémon overall, just watch out for strong Normal-type sweepers (unless you have Brick Break), fast users of Sleep Powder and Will-O-Wisps.</p>
