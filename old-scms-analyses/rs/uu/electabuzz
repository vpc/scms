[Overview]

<p>Great Speed, good Attack and Special Attack, good Special Defense... Electabuzz has very good stats and a very good movepool to boot. A top notch Underused Pokémon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thief and Toxic are primarily to stop the special walls in UU from lasting as long. Toxic is particularly effective on Hypno, because it lacks the ability to Rest due to Insomnia. Both work on Grumpig, either take away its Leftovers (and do a cool base 40 super effective attack) or Toxic it, either way, it's going to have a lot more trouble stopping you. Watch out for Thieving from Grumpig, however, as it might be a Trickbanding variant (if it tries to Trick right away, though, you'll just steal the Choice Band, and it will Trick it right back onto itself, so you do a 40 power Super Effective move for free). Substitute is to block status and help with prediction. Not much is hit in UU by Focus Punch / Cross Chop that isn't hit harder by your other moves, which is why it's not on here.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thunderbolt is his most consistent move for damage, Substitute up on something that will run from Electabuzz, and then Focus Punch anything that resists Thunderbolt. Thunder Wave is to paralyze, which you can abuse with Substitute, to scout for full paralysis before attacking safely behind a Substitute with one of the three other special attacks to cover some other types. Fire and Ice Punch are nice for Grass-types who can really mess you up on this set. Ice Punch has the advantage of hitting Grounds, but Fire Punch stops Steelix from ruining your fun.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Thunderbolt

<p>Support Electabuzz. Thunderbolt is his most damaging move, pick a status of your choice, then put the Light Screen in and either switch out to the Pokémon that needs to Light Screen or stay in and Counter the physical attacker who will switch in. A Bold nature helps Electabuzz survive attacks for Counter. Note: Do not try and Counter a STAB or Choice Banded Earthquake. You will die. You could use a Focus Band for this if you want, but don't.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Psychic could help with Muk and Venusaur, if you're having trouble with them for whatever reason. You could use Barrier to try and make Electabuzz survive a little longer / survive a STAB Earthquake and Counter it back for a quick kill. Thief is just an awesome move. Steal Leftovers from the most annoying staller you can find and laugh.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll need at least 244 Speed EVs to hit 307, beating Jolly Kangaskhan. Alternately, you could use 136 Speed EVs with a +Speed nature. Give it -Attack or -Defense, depending on whether you are using a Fighting move. Put the rest in Attack and Special Attack, always focusing more on Special Attack. The only time you're going to want to put some in Defense is for the last set, where you should focus on Defense, HP and Special Attack, with a little bit in its mediocre Special Defense, making it either Modest or Timid. A +Speed nature is almost exclusively to beat out Fearow, a very deadly UU Choice Bander. Otherwise, Electabuzz beats mostly the same things regardless of nature.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grumpig and Hypno are easily able to switch into it with their beefy Special defense and Muk is quite useful, seeing as it will soak up any of Electabuzz's moves with its HP. You might also try Lanturn and Ampharos, as Electabuzz is unable to really put a big dent into them, due to their resistance to most of Electabuzz's moves, and high Special Defense stats. Meganium and Vileplume could put up a fight, despite being weak to one of its moves.</p>
