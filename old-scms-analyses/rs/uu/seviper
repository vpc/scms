[Overview]

<p>Shed Skin is a very cool ability, and Seviper has great attack stats so he can get in a few good shots before he says his last goodbye. The movepool is really nice; it can make for some surprise in UU battles. Shame it is quite slow and defenseless; you'd better paralyze some of your opponents to use it to full potential.</p>

[SET]
name: Physically-oriented
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Giga Drain / Iron Tail
item: Choice Band
nature: Naughty / Lonely
evs: 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The standard attacking Seviper, hurts a lot of Pokémon in UU. Giga Drain is a nasty surprise for Quagsire and Hidden Power Ice makes Gligar paranoid. For the rest you just hit stuff. Choice Band is for that extra power—Seviper usually will not stay long before switching, since it is weak to a multitude of attacks. Leftovers work too, of course.</p>

[SET]
name: Specially-oriented
move 1: Crunch
move 2: Flamethrower
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Giga Drain
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 116 HP / 252 SpA / 140 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Special attacker. Crunch hurts Hypno and Ghosts a lot, Flamethrower just fries any Steels you might encounter, Giga Drain beats Golem and Quagsire again... a good surprise, but eventually you might miss the power you had with Sludge Bomb and Earthquake.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Snatch allows you to try to catch a Swords Dance and sweep. Glare is a little shaky on accuracy, but isn't bad. Rest is an option if you feel lucky with Shed Skin, as it can wake up immediately. Thief lets you steal Leftovers for the Special Sweeper set, maybe over Giga Drain or Crunch. Make sure not to have an item attached when using it. Screech is kind of novelty, but hey, he learns it, might induce a few switches.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For the first set, just max Attack. Get at least 197 Speed (124 EVs) and it will just about outrace Hypno, most Solrock, Walrein, and Blastoise, which could be crucial in some situations. Dump the rest in HP—your special attacks will usually 2HKO your targets, that's just enough. Adamant nature if you satisfy with that Special Attack, Lonely or Naughty if you don't.</p>

<p>The second set needs maximum Special Attack and the same 197 Speed, the rest in HP or Attack, whatever you desire.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Solrock, Lunatone, Gligar, Quagsire, Golem (watch out for HP Ice and Giga Drain), Banette, Misdreavus. Seviper isn't countered by much in UU, but it has a hard time switching in, unlike Muk and Crobat.</p>
