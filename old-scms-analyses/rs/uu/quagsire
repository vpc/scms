[Overview]

<p>Has a hard time in standard play, though Water Absorb is a lot of fun. The Counter set works the best there. Quagsire is an excellent UU Pokémon, quite hard to consistently beat. And if you're insane, it can counter Kyogre in Ubers (can't do much else though).</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The UU Swampert, except with Water Absorb. Still, Swampert is better in standard play unless you have a big weakness to Water. Curse up, launch STAB Earthquakes, hit Flying types with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Rock, and Rest when health is low or you've been statused. Chesto Berry is an option, because Quagsire doesn't have quite the staying power of Snorlax and Swampert to Rest without support, though I always use Leftovers.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Counter is AWESOME on Quagsire. About every Choice Bander in the game, from Aerodactyl to Salamence to Tauros will fail to OHKO Quagsire and be killed by a Counter. You can use Haze to make Quagsire a Suicune counter of sorts, and to force physical attackers to hit you instead of stat up. Toxic is awesome if you're playing UU, since Rest isn't as common there. Last move, either Ice Beam or Surf, is to hit stuff like Gengar and Donphan. Remember, you can counter all Hidden Power, even Hidden Power Grass.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Cursing version wants lots of HP and Special Defense. Adamant or Careful when not using Surf / Ice Beam, and Brave / Sassy when you are. The leftover EVs should go in Attack or Defense. For the Counter version, probably Impish, almost max HP, and a nice load of Defense to be able to take more hits. After that, stack Attack EVs.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Meganium, Mantine, Cloyster, and Jumpluff somewhat. Besides all this, anything with Hidden Power Grass.</p>
