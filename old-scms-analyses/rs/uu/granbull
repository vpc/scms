[Overview]

<p>With good stats, a nice ability, and an awesome movepool, Granbull is a great UU Pokemon. Not only can it be a hard hitter, it can also wipe away status from your team with Heal Bell while spreading paralysis around an opponent's team with Thunder Wave.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Return
move 3: Earthquake / Shadow Ball
move 4: Rest
item: Chesto Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Def / 12 SpD / 56 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The strategy for this set is rather simple: Bulk Up against physically weak opponents and Rest off the damage. The attack drop from Intimidate makes Bulking Up easier than with other Pokémon. The choice between Earthquake and Shadow Ball is dependent on your team. Earthquake covers Golem, Aggron, and other Normal-resistant Pokémon in UU, whereas Shadow Ball hits Misdreavus, Solrock, and Lunatone, and does a bit more to random Psychics than Return.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Return / Double-Edge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Focus Punch / Sleep Talk / Facade
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Def / 12 SpD / 56 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Granbull is dangerous in a UU environment. Its excellent Attack stat and diverse movepool more than compensate for its lackluster Speed. A team that has lost its physical wall will be devastated by this Granbull, therefore it will serve you better to save it for late game when you will be able to more accurately predict an opponent's moves which is the key to every Choice Band set.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Return
move 2: Earthquake / Shadow Ball
move 3: Heal Bell
move 4: Thunder Wave / Toxic
item: Leftovers 
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 40 Atk / 216 Def 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This utility set is a completely different direction for Granbull. It is slow but has the Defense to function as decent UU Heal Beller. Just don't pair it up with Exploud or Mr. Mime, as they cannot receive the benefits of Heal Bell. Give it whichever secondary attack and status you need more on your team. While this set isn't as generally good as the others, it is a valuable option due to lack of viable clerics in UU, where Toxic and Thunder Wave users abound.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Focus Punch
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Return
move 4: Shadow Ball
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant / Brave
evs: 196 HP / 252 Atk / 36 Def / 24 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Intimidate is always nice for a lead off Pokémon where this Granbull functions best. Substitute allows you to take a break from the prediction needed for the Choice Band set and sets up the powerful Focus Punch for the common Rock and Steel type switch-ins. Return is for STAB, and Shadow Ball hits Solrock and Lunatone, as well as Misdreavus and other Ghosts. You can use Brave to guarantee you'll move last, meaning you can take a hit, set up a Substitute, and then use Focus Punch as they break the Substitute.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Granbull is certainly beefy enough to Roar. It can take most physical hits to Counter back for big damage. Reflect is a good move to pseudo-pass if you really need it. Granbull may have access to many special moves, but those should be avoided because of how much lower Granbull's Special Attack is compared to its Attack.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Adamant with nearly max Attack for every set except for the Heal Beller is the usual way to go. The utility Granbull will need more HP and Def that the others, though its Attack should never be neglected.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blastoise and Walrein can take on hits from non-Choice Band sets and stall it out with Rest, but they aren't always the best choice. Reflect Meganium can take a few hits and heal them off with Leech Seed or Synthesis. You'll probably be best off by hitting it with STAB Thunderbolts from the Electric types or other fast hard hitters. If it lacks Earthquake, Aggron and Golem will stop it cold. If it lacks Shadow Ball, Misdreavus will have a chance to set up and sweep, and Solrock will be able to beat it 1v1.
