[Overview]

<p>As you can imagine Ninetales is fragile but useful. Your team members will sure appreciate the support of sleep, burn, and Grudge.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When used with some prediction, Ninetales can screw around with his opponents badly. You have 100 Special Defense, so your opponent will most likely bring in a physical attacker to mess with you—only to get burned by Will-O-Wisp. When the end is near and you want to sacrifice Ninetales, it's time for his big contribution to the team: Grudge. If you use it on the turn your opponent kills you, all PP of that attacking move is stripped off. This can help you to set up another Pokémon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can use Flamethrower over Fire Blast, but Fire Blast is recommended because its Special Attack is quite low. Confuse Ray makes you hard to hit, but can work against you when you Grudge and they hit themselves in confusion. Hypnosis is a gamble, but a very rewarding one. You can use it with Will-O-Wisp if you wish: put one Pokémon to sleep, and then burn another. Toxic is another alternative status ailment; burn is better on physical attackers though. Hidden Power Ice takes a chunk of life out of Altaria.</p>

[EVs]

<p>At least 148 EVs in Speed and Timid nature for 300 Speed, but max is nice. Spread the rest over HP, Special Attack and Special Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Camerupt is a good Ninetales counter. Wailord can switch in on Will-O-Wisp due to its trait, Water Veil, making it unable to be burned. Blastoise won't care about being hit by Will-O-Wisp and will dispatch Ninetales away quite easily with Surf, unless it gets Grudged. Generally all Fire-types will wall Ninetales though, so if you happen to have one, have fun!
