[Overview]

<p>Another Pokemon restricted to the confines of UU, due to Dodrio being better than it in every way. In the UU environment, however, Fearow is always a recommended choice due to its high Speed and brutally powerful STAB moves.</p>

<p>Fearow is a common staple in underused teams, so you can just about bet your boots that you will face one in an UU tournamet. It's not hard to figure out; just pick an attack move. It's one of the fastest UU Pokemon, and with Choice Band backing it, it can deal quite a fair bit of damage, even without having to be a super effective hit. Quick Attack, despite being weak, can sometimes make all the difference when you need it the most, and Hidden Power Ground is there to deal with nasty Rock or Steel-types.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Agility / Substitute
move 3: Return
move 4: Hidden Power Ground
item: Leftovers / Liechi Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def

<p>Fearow got Baton Pass as an XD move, so it can be nice to pass stuff around when people are expecting the Choice Band version.</p>

<p>Use 252 Speed EVs with Jolly if you're using Substitute, or the suggested EVs with Adamant and Agility.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Fearow has a pathetic movepool, sadly, which is another reason why it isn't as great as Dodrio. Well, Steel Wing can be used to hit Solrock and Lunatone, same for Hidden Power Ghost (which also hits UU Ghosts harder than Drill Peck, but that doesn't cover the Rock / Steel-types). Hidden Power Ground, however, is better overall, especially against Aggron. Double-Edge is another option over Return just for that extra punch. Double-Edge from Fearow HURTS UUs that aren't named Golem or Aggron (and other walls with a Rock / Steel typing). Hyper Beam can do some serious damage if Fearow is about to die, or if you want to kill the opponent's last Pokémon.</p>

[EVs]

<p>4 in HP, 252 Attack, and 252 Speed, using a Jolly nature to outspeed and hit as much as possible.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Stuff like Rock- and Steel-types follow the trend of walling Fearow, especially Golem and Solrock. Ghost-types like Sableye and Banette can be used too. You should, however, be careful while switching stuff into Fearow again as it can hit pretty hard if the player predicts right. Strong defensive Pokémon like Blastoise or Gligar may trouble you.</p>
