[Overview]

<p>It is indeed a very cool UU, and has some potential to be used in OU play. You'll have trouble getting it in, but once you do and get the Sunny Day, it's a menace to get rid of. I don't know why it got Grass-type since it's a Tengu, a bird-like evil spirit, but it's a good thing it did. It also has some use in Ubers, paired with Groudon for the Speed boost, so it can just abuse Shadow Ball to hit all the Psychic Ubers.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Nothing resists Shadow Ball + Brick Break, Choice Band Explosion HURTS and Quick Attack / Fake Out if you need to finish off something. You need prediction, like every Choice Bander. The lack of STAB hurts, but you have the element of unpredictability. Ability won't matter all that much, Early Bird can help sopping up Sleep status and still be able to wake up before the match is over, Chlorophyll if you can get your opponent or one of your other Pokémon to use Sunny Day.</p>

move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Swords Dance

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A lot like the last set, except with Swords Dance this time over Choice Band.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Growth and Synthesis, but don't use them, they are just the other mediocre moves Shiftry learns. Better go with the above sets.</p>
