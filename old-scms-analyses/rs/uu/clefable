[Overview]

<p>Clefable is really unpredictable and that's where its strength lies. There are zero safe counters for him. However, once its set is found out, its average stats across the board will cause difficulties in damaging things effectively. All sets are quite viable for UU play.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Belly Drumming Clefable is quite fun, but not too good since after a Belly Drum its Attack is only 1048. Clefable is also quite slow which makes it hard to take advantage of its super high Attack, so make sure to paralyze some sweepers beforehand, or do it yourself with Thunder Wave. Even if you aren't able to find an opportunity to use Belly Drum, you can still get some random Attack boosts by using Meteor Mash if you picked that. Cosmic Power is an option as well to make this set more tankish: basically you Cosmic Power until you're not taking much damage from the opponent, use Softboiled to recover the damage, Belly Drum up, and start hitting things. If you come across a Ghost or something that can kill you in the long run, Softboiled to full HP, then switch out to come back later and try again.</p>

<p>Standard Calm Mind Clefable, Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are only resisted by Magneton, Lanturn, and Shedinja. It doesn't do much against good Special sponges either. This Clefable's greatest enemy is Toxic. You can Rest it off, but expect to get hit hard physically then by Fearow or Aggron, for example. You can toy around with the EVs: more Special Defense means Calm Mind will make your Special Defense absolutely impregnable by Manectric or other Special Attackers, more Defense means you will get great defenses on both sides, and more Special Attack means you will have more firepower.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Counter is one of Clefable's coolest moves. Pokémon that can be surprised by Counter include Fearow, Tauros, Quagsire, and many more. Clefable survives all of these. The first two moveslots can be about anything: Ice Beam + Thunderbolt is a good idea as well, and Calm Mind works to lure even more physical attacks; if you use Calm Mind, make sure to use a Special Attack in the other free moveslot. You can also use Light Screen in a similar way. Preferably don't use Thunder Wave here: if you Counter against a paralyzed Pokémon, you risk that they get fully paralyzed and your surprise will be given away.</p>

<p>Make sure to switch to Bold and to shift Attack EVs to Special Attack when running Special Attacking moves.</p>

<p>A stalling set, takes a long time to win with. I don't like this set because you usually get forced to Rest and then phazed, and stalling for so long is just begging to eat a critical hit. I'd always go with Rest here, using Softboiled makes you vulnerable to status. Use Encore on some attacking move and Seismic Toss them to death, or Toxic so your opponent loses HP even while you are setting up or recovering. Flamethrower / Fire Blast is a good option on this set to shut down Steel-types and Weezing.</p>

<p>A more novel set. Please, use one of your many other Normal Choice Bander options. The only thing Clefable has over them is Meteor Mash, which isn't that great anyway. Feel free to blend in a special move like Flamethrower or Thunderbolt to hurt Skarmory. With these EVs you should be able to outpace Meganium, Blastoise, and about anything else with 200 Speed or lower.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Fire Blast as a more powerful option over Flamethrower. Psychic is for Fighting-types. Reflect is a great move to support your team with and can work in tandem with Counter. Safeguard supports, too, but to a lesser extent. Sing can catch any Clefable counter with a quick Sleep, and can help you set up Calm Mind or Belly Drum. Snatch can get you a Substitute, Calm Mind, Recover, Softboiled, Aromatherapy or Dragon Dance, as long as you're good at predicting. It's a novelty move though. Wish can be considered an option over Softboiled most of the time, Clefable is an above average Wisher. It might be wise to use Protect with it, which can also check what a Choice Bander is going to do, it can help your Leftovers recovery and it saves you from Explosion.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Depends completely on the set, and there's still no strict way of doing them. Using the Magic Stat Numbers article gives you an idea what you can use for EVs on Clefable. Stick with what's given on the sets.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Countering Clefable safely is hard; you'll usually have to use a combination of Pokémon. Any Pokémon with Rest stalls out the Toxic staller. Steel and Poison-types work as well, though Weezing and the Steels should beware of Fire moves.</p>

<p>Generally, powerful offense, Toxic, and Leech Seed stop Clefable. It often has to use Softboiled, so use that to switch in a counter easily.</p>

<p>Quagsire does about as well as Swampert and counters it under the same conditions. Hypno can Toxic or Thunder Wave Clefable and wall it, though Choice Band Clefable or generally Shadow Baller can hurt, and Hypno doesn't enjoy Toxic itself. Some offense from Aggron or Fearow can hurt Clefable a lot, but beware of Counter.</p>
