[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Surf is mainly here for STAB and so you can hit stuff like Solrock. Hypnosis is a fun status move and in UU, pretty much everything but Hypno, Banette, and the rare Sleep Talking Lanturn will be put to sleep by this guy. Ice Beam hits Grass Pokémon and Gligar for even more damage. Counter is probably the best move option, since it can withstand a lot of physical attacks and deal them back for damage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Psychic might beat the occasional Hitmonlee and Poliwrath or something. Swagger and Toxic are there because if you want to be "annoying", you might as well use them.</p>

[EVs]

<p>The EVs mentioned with the moveset is close to pretty much the best you will get. With maximum HP, it can deal the most Counter damage possible, and that gives it enough Speed to hit 201 which is a good Speed to aim for whenever you are around that area. The rest could be stuck in Special Attack or Defense, but Special Attack seems like the wiser choice.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fellow Water-types such as Lanturn, and Mantine and Sleep Talk Walrein with Toxic or Hidden Power Grass, can take most anything from Politoed, including its own Hidden Power Grass. Lanturn even boasts a STAB Thunderbolt of its own with which to destroy Politoed quickly. Swords Dance Tentacruel uses its high Special Defense to set up extremely easily on Politoed and proceeds to sweep. The standard special walls of Hypno and Grumpig counter Politoed excellently as well; Hypno's Insomnia also nullifies one of Politoed's main selling points, Hypnosis. Meganium, Vileplume, and Bellossom have high Special Defense and recovery moves in Synthesis and Moonlight, and hit with Grass STAB. Banette boasts a very powerful Shadow Ball and immunity to Counter due to its Ghost typing. Electrics such as Electabuzz and Manectric make short work of Politoed.</p>
