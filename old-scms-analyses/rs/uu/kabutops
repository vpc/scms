[Overview]

<p>Kabutops is a threat in UU matches.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance + Flail
move 1: Endure
move 2: Flail
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Rock Slide
item: Salac Berry
ability: Battle Armor
nature: Jolly
evs: 12 HP / 252 Atk / 68 Def / 176 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a flailing set for Kabutops. This can work in UU, but be mindful of Quick Attackers since combos like Endure/Flail are common in UU. 264 Speed is all that is needed since with Salac Berry, reaches 396 Speed. Jolly is required, because otherwise you won't reach that 264 Speed.</p>

[SET]
name: Knock Off
move 1: Hidden Power Ground
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Swords Dance
item: Leftovers
ability: Battle Armor
nature: Adamant
evs: 70 HP / 252 Atk / 188 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Knock Off makes Kabutops very annoying and can really help out your team.  This set has its uses in UU since it means that Pokémon like Hypno have to recover more and Pokémon like Fearow that use Choice Band a lot cannot sweep as effectively.<p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance Sweeper
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Surf
item: Leftovers / Lum Berry
ability: Swift Swim
nature: Naughty
evs: 156 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe / 92 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is very straight forward and can definitely work in UU since Swift Swimmers can be fairly potent. Use Rain Dance to double your speed and sweep. You can Swords Dance as well to make yourself faster and your attacks much stronger. However, you don't necessarily have to use Surf, but it is a good idea. If you don't want to, use an Adamant Nature and put the Special Attack power into Speed. Surf is useful though for beating things like Solrock since Solrock and other similar Pokémon don't take as much damage from your main attack. Lum Berry is a good item choice so that your sweep isn't ruined by paralysis or burn.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Double-Edge / Return
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Hidden Power Ground
move 4: Brick Break / Knock Off
item: Choice Band
ability: Battle Armor
nature: Adamant
evs: 70 HP / 252 Atk / 188 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This can be useful with some prediction since Kabutops has above-average Attack. The lack of Earthquake as a move choice though, really hinders Kabutops' ability to sweep. Double-Edge can really damage something, but Return works if you don't like recoil damage. Rock Slide is a good move in general and is a good STAB attack to have. Hidden Power Ground can hit Steel-types. It's a toss-up between Brick Break and Knock Off though, since Brick Break can hurt Normals much harder. Knock Off, on the other hand, is good for a hit-and-run and is generally annoying.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Giga Drain can be used to attack Ground, Rock, and Water-types in the switch in, just in case they might be resistant to one of your physical attacks, most notably Quagsire. Thief can be fun for stealing items, such as Choice Bands and Leftovers to help make life hard for your opponents, but Knock Off is superior. Confuse Ray can give you a bit more time to sweep. Body Slam gives the chance of some Paralysis, which can also be useful. </p>

[EVs]

<p>At least 264 Speed for the Endure set. Rain Dance Kabutops only needs 8 EVs of speed to get it at 198. Swords Dancing versions might want to attempt max Speed. Maximum attack power is always good on Kabutops as well. Don't use a -Special Attack nature if you plan on using a special attack since Kabutops has below-average Special Attack. If you're using Substitute with Flail, make sure your HP is not divisible by 4 so you are able to Substitute four times and maximize Flail's power.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Golem, Solrock and Aggron counter most of Kabutops' sets because of their physical resistances and high Defense. They are weak to Surf though. Kabutops cannot really hit Meganium and kill it quickly, so Meganium can Counter an attack back or kill it outright. Blastoise has good defensive stats, and because it is a Water-type, Kabutops cannot get around its Defense without being hit hard by Blastoise. Hypno can wall Kabutops fairly well because of Wish, Reflect, and its ability to status Kabutops. However, if Kabutops knocks off Hypno's Leftovers, it can have a chance to dent it. Quagsire and Whiscash counter Kabutops in the same way Swampert does: they resist Rock and have decent Defense while packing a STAB Earthquake.</p>
