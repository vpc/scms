[Overview]

<p>Kingler looks cool, but alas, there are better Flailers and / or Swords Dancers around and too many Quick Attack users. 130 Attack and no STAB, and then 50 Special Attack and one exclusive STAB move really doesn't cut it. Kingler is a cool novelty Pokémon.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance + Flail
move 1: Endure / Substitute
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Flail
move 4: Crabhammer / Hidden Power Ghost
item: Salac Berry
ability: Hyper Cutter
nature: Naughty / Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kind of outmatched by Pinsir, Kabutops, and a few more things, but Kingler can still try to pull it off. Either Substitute down to 1 HP or just use Endure, then Flail away. Swords Dance if you can find the time. Crabhammer is to try and get a critical hit when you're up against Gligar, Aggron, and the like, as well as a potential OHKO on Golem. Note that after a Swords Dance, Kingler OHKOs Gligar with max power Flail. Hidden Power Ghost just hits Misdreavus and Sableye in UU, which are both very rare. Whichever move you pick, you'll be hitting Solrock and Lunatone moderately hard (but Hidden Power Ghost will of course do more). Since Kingler has just 75 base Speed, you will often face faster Pokémon, and when using Substitute in your set you will need some prediction to beat them. Substitute if you think they will attack, use your weak fourth moveslot if they use Substitute, and in other cases use Swords Dance. If you use Substitute the same turn they break it every turn, you end up at 1% with Salac Berry triggered and a Substitute up. Hyper Cutter helps a lot to prevent Kingler from being Intimidated.</p>

[SET]
name: Knock Off
move 1: Body Slam
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Crabhammer / Hidden Power Ghost
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
nature: Adamant / Naughty
evs: 252 HP / 200 Atk / 56 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you don't like going all-out with Flail, this is probably your best bet. Knock Off is a very nice move that will allow Kingler's teammates to 2HKO things more easily or force Rest earlier. Body Slam because paralysis is your and Kingler's friend.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Kingler's movepool isn't exactly big. Double-Edge is about his only decent physical move (poor, poor Kingler with his 130 Attack). Then you have Haze, though Kingler cannot survive too long.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Generally, you will want to max Kingler's Attack. You'll want to either pump HP to survive physical attacks, or pump Speed to beat certain things. Most things are not going to help more, unless you are going to try and survive some particular attacks, but in general, having full Attack power (and thus having less chance of bringing your opponent to 0% or something else you can't afford) and having high Speed is needed on Salac sets.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokémon with Endure and Salac Berry can Endure on Kingler and will almost always outrace it then. Relevant counters would be Meganium, Blastoise, and Quagsire. Every UU Electric-type Pokémon will beat it, though aside from Ampharos, they will find a hard time switching in.</p>
