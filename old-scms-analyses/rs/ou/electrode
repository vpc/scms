[Overview]

<p>Electrode is one of those Pokemon that only kills something by killing itself. Sadly, it is probably one of the worst Electric-types, possibly surpassing only Plusle and Minun.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Substitute down to 1 HP for the OHKO with Explosion, but after Electrode gets the Liechi Berry boost, it might be predictable. All in all, it's risky to use, but it's cool. Electrode can be a pretty dangerous Pokemon, especially as it is faster than the feared Aerodactyl. Only use Leftovers with Substitute, because Electrode won't survive much of anything.</p>

<p>Hit a 396 Speed stat, and put the rest in Attack and Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey and Snorlax easily soak up its special moves, and Celebi can wall most of what Electrode can throw out. Raikou works well, as do any of the Ground-types—Flygon, Swampert, Claydol, Steelix—depending on its Hidden Power. Venusaur and Exeggutor are also good switch-ins to Electrode.</p>
