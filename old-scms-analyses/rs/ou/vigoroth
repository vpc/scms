[Overview]

<p>Not a bad Pokémon at all. Often gets pushed aside for its evolution and the other Normal-types, but in UU it could actually work if you're sick to death of Kangaskhan. If it only got Swords Dance...</p>

[SET]
name: Flail + Reversal
move 1: Endure / Substitute
move 2: Flail
move 3: Reversal / Shadow Ball
move 4: Bulk Up / Reversal
item: Salac Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Vigoroth gets an analysis because technically, it's not inferior to Slaking—it gets a huge ability disadvantage upon evolution (Truant), and it has some nice move options, so it has its uses. Anyway, Vigoroth, Slaking, Smeargle and Heracross are the only Pokémon able to pull off both Reversal and Flail. If you're not looking for Heracross on your team, you might want to give Vigoroth a shot. Shame it doesn't get Swords Dance, but Bulk Up might actually help Vigoroth's Substitute stand more than one hit so you can get more in. Watch out for Tyranitar and first priority moves like Quick Attack and Fake Out.</p>

<p>If you are using Bulk Up, consider dropping the Speed down considerably for more HP, to give Vigoroth more time to use Bulk Up. Vigoroth can go as low as 227 Speed and still be faster than any base 105 after a Salac Berry, even if they have a +Speed nature and 252 EVs, which is faster than almost anything in UU. Just make sure your HP isn't divisible by 4 if you are using Substitute—it will leave you at 25% and incapable of using Substitute again, so you'll have 80 power on Flail and Reversal instead of 200.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Bulk Up
move 3: Focus Punch
move 4: Flail / Reversal / Shadow Ball / Body Slam
item: Salac Berry / Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Similar set, except this one is revolved around Focus Punch. Try to prevent the Substitute from breaking with Bulk Up and eventual paralysis support, and smash away on those Skarmory's and Metagross that pop up. Return does more damage when both are equally effective qua typing, Shadow Ball busts Ghosts, and Flail and Reversal work with Salac Berry when you're down at 1HP—when not using those, use Leftovers.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Return / Body Slam
move 3: Earthquake / Shadow Ball
move 4: Slack Off / Shadow Ball
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you don't like depending on 1 HP to use Vigoroth, try this—a normal Bulk Up set. Body Slam if you like Paralysis, otherwise Return. Earthquake Metagross, Tyranitar, Aggron, and Golem or Shadow Ball Gengar, Misdreavus, and Dusclops. If you don't want them both, try one of the other three moves to beat other physical Pokémon with. Slack Off so you simply use Bulk Up, restore HP when needed, repeat, until you've gotten enough Bulk Ups to sweep.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Return / Double-Edge
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Focus Punch
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>It has to be mentioned. Vigoroth and his evolved form get loads of physical moves, and he can use them well. I'd stick with Tauros for this one, or Kangaskhan in UU, but it's a great way to deal damage without the use of Bulk Up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Encore could work to some extent with 90 Speed, outspeeding most stalling Pokémon. Taunt could work if your opponent tries to counter you with Skarmory or some other Pokémon that poses a threat with a non-attacking move.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Your basic Normal counters. Ghosts stop it dead in its tracks if it has no Shadow Ball. Metagross, Jirachi, and Tyranitar give trouble when you don't have Earthquake. Not only that, but Tyranitar also makes Vigoroth without Leftovers difficult to use, especially the ones dependant on Reversal / Flail. Quick Attack, ExtremeSpeed, and Mach Punch beat any set with Flail / Reversal, Fake Out beats Substitute versions of Flail / Reversal sets. Other than that, any hard hit, especially a Special attack from someone like Manectric or Vileplume is going to hurt Vigoroth a lot since it has a whopping 55 Special Defense to play with.</p>
