[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a fairly standard Choice Band user, with one niche: the capability to switch with impunity into paralyzing moves such as Thunder Wave thanks to Limber. Hidden Power Ghost and Rock Slide hit the Pokemon that resist Hitmonlee's Fighting STAB, Salamence in particular.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Double Kick helps against threats such as Substitute Tyranitar, but it's not that useful.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Salamence and Gyarados can come in on anything but Rock Slide thanks to their resistance to Fighting and Intimidate, and have Flying STAB to take Hitmonlee down. Gengar, Dusclops, Weezing, and Claydol are popular OU counters that beat Hitmonlee due to their resistance to Fighting and high Defense.</p>
