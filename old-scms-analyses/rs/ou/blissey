[Overview]

<p>Blissey is nothing short of incredible. Most if not all special attackers are useless against Blissey's insane HP stat and incredible Special Defense stat; even some physical attackers have trouble getting past Blissey's tough HP stat, despite her pitiful Defense stat. However, unlike other Pokemon with incredibly defensive stats like Dusclops, Blissey can pose a serious offensive threat. With Calm Mind and a myriad of offensive options such as Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass, Blissey can sweep through teams once powerful physical attackers are weakened or defeated. Additionally, as if Blissey wasn't good enough, it also has if not the best then one of the best movepools in the entire game. Need a cleric? Blissey has Aromatherapy. Need Wish support? Blissey has Wish!</p>

<p>Although Blissey is an incredible Pokemon, there's a reason it's not found on every team. Blissey's main problem is her lack of an immediate offensive presence. Snorlax and Regice, while being significantly worse specially defensive walls than Blissey, have strong offensive traits that allow them to threaten most Pokemon. Blissey needs Calm Mind to deal any sort of reasonable damage to any Pokemon in the metagame, and giving devastating physical attackers like Heracross and Tyranitar a chance to safely switch in can be devastating. Finally, Blissey's pitiful Defense stat ensures that nearly all physical attackers in OU will 2HKO her. However, despite lacking an offensive presence and a having a terrible Defense stat, Blissey stands tall and fat as one of the best Pokemon in OU and not considering using her is silliness.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Blissey's offensive stats are far from stellar, Blissey is one of the best Calm Mind users in the metagame. With an incredible HP stat, a great Special Defense stat, and a workable Special Attack stat, Blissey shines as a special tank that can not only take any special attack thrown at her, but can also sweep. Calm Mind is obviously needed, boosting Blissey's Special Attack to incredible levels and her Special Defense to unbreakable levels. Softboiled allows Blissey to thrive throughout the match, ensuring that it can check the plethora of special attackers in the metagame. The last two moveslots depend on what you are willing to lose to and want to beat. If using Thunderbolt, you need to be using Ice Beam; when using the two aforementioned moves, Blissey has a harder time beating Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi, Swampert, and Tyranitar. However, with Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, Blissey can also serve as a check to Salamence and Gyarados lacking Choice Band. With Flamethrower, Hidden Power Grass is a must; when using the two previously mentioned moves, Blissey will now lose to Salamence and Gyarados in exchange for more comfortably beating Jirachi, Swampert, Metagross, and Tyranitar. When choosing the final two moveslots it's a good idea to look at your team and see what Pokemon are more threatening for it. Regardless of the final two moveslots you choose, Blissey will still do a great job of checking any special attacker that comes your way.</p>

<p>Maximum Special Attack investment is mandatory so that Blissey is dealing as much damage as possible; most notably, maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature OHKOes all Dugtrio variants. Maximum Defense investment is necessary to tank physical hits from Pokemon lacking a Choice Band, as well as having any chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Band Dugtrio. A Modest nature is good for dealing as much damage as possible, while a Bold nature is viable for tanking physical hits with greater ease. As far as moveset changes, you really need to stick with the given set. Wish is the only move that could be changed, however, being able to instantly heal Blissey is generally more important than keeping your teammates healthy. Fire Blast, Thunder, and Blizzard may seem viable, but their lack of PP and mediocre accuracy, especially in Thunder and Blizzard's case, really lowers their viability.</p>

<p>Since Blissey has a lot of trouble with physical attackers, some of her best partners are ones that can defeat powerful Pokemon that target her pitiful Defense stat. Will-O-Wisp Gengar is a great partner as it can cripple the physical attackers that Blissey hates and can switch into Snorlax with relative ease. Skarmory is an excellent Blissey partner as it can switch into nearly every physical attacker in the metagame with ease, set up Spikes, and proceed to wear down physical attackers with residual damage from Spikes. Also, Blissey covers all the special threats that Skarmory can't deal with, namely Gengar and Fire Punch Jirachi. When looking at optimal Blissey partners, it's best to look at Pokemon that can either defeat most physical attackers like Suicune, cripple physical attackers like Gengar, or wall them like Skarmory.</p>

<p>This set sacrifices a significant offensive presence in order to support her team. Blissey is found on nearly all stall teams, and with Aromatherapy, she can wake up sleeping Suicune and Zapdos. On more offensive teams, Cleric Blissey is useful for removing a burn from Snorlax that may have been given to Snorlax by a Gengar, paralysis on a Salamence, and other status. Softboiled is a must on all Blissey sets, ensuring that she is healthy enough to survive throughout the match. Seismic Toss is Blissey's most reliable way of dealing damage to opposing Pokemon. Although Seismic Toss makes Blissey a less efficient check to Calm Mind users with recovery moves, Seismic Toss still lets Blissey check a number of important Pokemon such as Raikou, offensive Jirachi, offensive Suicune without Substitute, offensive Zapdos, Jolteon, and many more. As for the last moveslot, there are a number of legitimate options. Ice Beam is preferred by many players as it allows Blissey to beat Dugtrio. Additionally, Ice Beam lets Blissey hurt Gengar, as well as OHKO Salamence. Thunder Wave is useful for crippling a lot of Blissey's more offensive switch-ins, namely Gyarados and Tyranitar. Also, with paralysis support, your team may be more adept at checking the powerful special attackers that Cleric Blissey can't normally beat, such as Calm Mind + Leech Seed Celebi. Finally, Toxic is useful for halting a Celebi's sweep, forcing a Suicune to rest prematurely, as well as crippling other Pokemon that don't appreciate Toxic like Tyranitar.</p>

<p>The EV spread allows Blissey to OHKO standard Salamence, 3HKO Zapdos in sand, 3HKO standard Celebi in sand, and OHKO all Dugtrio. If you're not using Ice Beam, move the Special Attack EVs to Defense. There's no need to invest in Blissey's Special Defense stat since it's so big; by investing more HP into Defense, Blissey will find more opportunities to heal itself, support her team with Aromatherapy, and spread status. Although Cleric Blissey is a much more defensive than her Calm Mind counterpart, standard teammates still apply. Will-O-Wisp Gengar is a good partner for switching to the Fighting-type attacks that Blissey lures in, and burning physical attackers that threaten Blissey. Skarmory is a good partner, as it can take nearly all the physical attacks that Blissey hates, with the exception of STAB Fighting-type attacks; set up Spikes, and defeat physical attackers with Hidden Power Flying, Drill Peck, or Toxic.</p>

<p>Similar to Cleric Blissey, WishBliss sacrifices a lot of Calm Mind Blissey's offensive presence in order to support her team. Wish is what separates this Blissey set from the other ones, ensuring that your team is healthy throughout the battle. The second moveslot comes down to preference. Protect is useful for scouting for attacks, receiving a Wish, and many other things. Although it may seem silly to use Softboiled and Wish on the same set, being able to recover half of your HP instantly is very important. When using Wish and Protect, it gives your opponent a free switch in to Choice Band Pokemon, Calm Mind users, and other threatening attackers. With Softboiled, there's fewer turns that a powerful attackers can switch in. Seismic Toss is mandatory on all Blissey lacking Calm Mind, as Seismic Toss enables Blissey to check Raikou, offensive Jirachi, and many other special attackers more efficiently. For the final moveslot, Ice Beam is preferred for slamming Celebi, Zapdos, and most importantly Dugtrio, ensuring that the three-headed mole can't trap and 2HKO Blissey with ease. Thunder Wave is useful for crippling offensive Pokemon that rely on their Speed, such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, while Toxic is useful for drastically limiting the survivability of any Pokemon hit with the aforementioned status. </p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If not using Ice Beam, move the Special Attack EVs into HP and make the nature Bold. There's no need to invest in Special Defense because Blissey already has an enormous Special Defense stat. With more EVs invested in Defense, Blissey will find more opportunities to switch into non-boosted physical attackers and support her team with Wish. As far as teammates go, Choice Band Pokemon are amongst WishBliss's best teammates. One of the most major and intrinsic flaws of all Choice Band Pokemon is that they lack recovery; often times, Choice Band Pokemon will have to deal with residual damage from Spikes, Sand Stream, or they will be forced to take resisted attacks in order for them to switch in. After a while, the damage racks up and you may find yourself with a weakened Choice Band Pokemon. Luckily, Blissey is able to heal all your Choice Band Pokemon, ensuring that they can bring the pain for an extended period of time. Other than Choice Band Pokemon, the teammates listed earlier are just as viable. Will-O-Wisp Gengar nearly neutralizes all physical attackers while Skarmory and Blissey form an incredible defensive duo capable of checking a very large portion of the metagame.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>As far as other options go, Blissey has a lot in the literal sense as her movepool is nearly as large as its HP stat. However, it's usually better to stick with the moves listed earlier. Counter is probably the best option that hasn't been listed previously as Blissey can tank most physical attacks that aren't super effective or boosted by a Choice Band and retaliate with Counter, likely OHKOing the opponent's Pokemon. Sing is a possibility over Toxic or Thunder Wave but its accuracy is horrendous. Additionally, Sing doesn't deter Pokemon such as Calm Mind Celebi and Jirachi from switching out as they can take Seismic Toss and Ice Beam (Celebi needs a Calm Mind though), wait until they wake up, recover off any HP lost with Recover or Wish, and continue setting up until you hit another Sing. The rest of Blissey's movepool contains moves that could've been good for other Pokemon such as Brick Break and Focus Punch but you really should be sticking with the sets listed or the previously mentioned opponents.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>One of Blissey's largest problems is her terrible Defense stat; thus, nearly all physical attackers make for great Blissey checks. Snorlax is Blissey's best counter; it possesses an excellent HP stat, great Attack stat, and high enough Special Defense stat, so it can not only take anything Blissey wants to throw at it but it can also threaten her out with a physical attack. Additionally, both of Snorlax's abilities are very good versus Blissey; Immunity stops more defensive Blissey variants from poisoning Snorlax on the switch, while Thick Fat lets Snorlax take on the Calm Mind set with greater ease. Other than Snorlax, the best overall Blissey switch-in, most physical attackers that defeat Blissey with ease. Choice Band Salamence with Brick Break, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Taunt Dragon Dance Gyarados, Heracross, Metagross, and many other physical attackers do a great job of beating Blissey, under the right circumstances. Remember that depending on Calm Mind Blissey's moves, it can deal a great amount of damage to any of the physical attackers on the switch in; for example, Gyarados is OHKOed by Thunderbolt. Thus, it's usually a good idea to scout out your opponent's Blissey set before switching in your powerful physical attackers.</p>

<p>Despite being the undisputed best specially defensive Pokemon in the tier, maybe even the game, there are still certain special attackers that Blissey can lose to. With the aid of Spikes, Metal Sound Zapdos and Calm Mind + Roar Suicune can wither away at Blissey's HP and sweep when the chance is right. Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune easily defeats any Blissey set lacking Calm Mind, as Seismic Toss fails to break Suicune's Substitute. Suicune can then proceed to block status with Substitute, set up Calm Minds, and run through your opponent's team. Wish + Calm Mind Jirachi can set up all over Blissey's lacking Calm Mind as it is immune to Toxic. Calm Mind + Leech Seed Celebi can beat Blissey without Toxic or Calm Mind and has the potential to beat Calm Mind Blissey as Leech Seed deters Blissey from staying in for too long. Metal Sound Zapdos, and to a lesser extent Magneton, can defeat Blissey by lowering her Special Defense and bombarding the pink blob with Thunderbolt.</p>
