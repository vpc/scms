[Overview]

<p>With resistances to both Bug- and Fighting-type attacks, as well as an immense Defense stat, Weezing is an ideal Heracross counter; it can survive even the most powerful Focus Punches from the likes of Machamp and Medicham as well. It can ruin boosting physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and Haze, so it is a great switch-in to Snorlax too. Finally, it gives Baton Pass chains a hard time as long as it isn't put to sleep or trapped and outstalled.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weezing is the best Fighting-type counter and Haze user in the game. This is a simple set: burn physical threats with Will-O-Wisp, Haze if they set up, and wear them down with Sludge Bomb or Flamethrower. Steel- and Rock-types with Substitute might give Weezing problems here, but Flamethrower can deal with the former.</p>

<p>The EV spread simply maximizes Weezing's HP and Defense to give it optimum physical bulk. Due to its low HP stat, Weezing gets more physical bulk by maximizing HP than by putting EVs into Defense. Thus, if you don't wish to maximize Defense, just use a lot of Defense EVs with a Defense-boosting nature, and put the rest in Attack or Special Attack.</p>

move 2: Flamethrower / Fire Blast

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A more offensive take on Weezing, this set is surprisingly effective and can put a dent in stall-based teams. The only thing it needs to look out for are Dusclops and Gengar.</p>

<p>The EV spread is somewhat complex; invest heavily in Attack, put 68 EVs in Special Attack to KO Skarmory and Heracross more easily, and dump the rest in HP so that Weezing can still take a few hits here and there.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thunderbolt and Thunder are alternate attacking options that give Gyarados trouble while simultaneously hitting Skarmory. Shadow Ball can hit Dusclops and Gengar a bit harder.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Milotic is a great counter to Weezing as it can take advantage of poison or burn from Sludge Bomb and Will-O-Wisp with Marvel Scale. Other counters include Fire-types, who are immune to Will-O-Wisp; Houndoom in particular can hit Weezing with Pursuit as it switches out. Ghost-types such as Dusclops and Gengar stop Weezing cold as well. Skarmory can absorb Will-O-Wisp, set up Spikes, and Rest off the damage or be healed by Blissey or Celebi afterwards, but it needs to watch out for Flamethrower and Thunderbolt. Swellow can switch into Will-O-Wisp, activate Guts, and OHKO Weezing with a Choice Band Facade and some prior damage; Ursaring is even worse news with its huge base 130 Attack.</p>
