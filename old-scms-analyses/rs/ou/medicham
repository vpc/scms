[Overview]

<p>Medicham is, in short, the most powerful Pokemon—aside from possibly Slaking. Especially if it runs a Choice Band, it will pummel you to hell and back. With the potential to be an absolute monster, Medicham should be feared by any self-respecting battler. However, Medicham will be mediocre if you can't predict well enough to switch him in safely or hit opponents super effectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Brick Break / Hi Jump Kick
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Fake Out / Focus Punch
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>An absolute terror, nothing can stall Medicham except maybe Weezing. Note that you will have to predict a switch to get Medicham in safely; you don't want it taking any hits at all, because it will faint.</p>

<p>Medicham should always run maximum Attack and hit a stat of at least 244 Speed. If using a Jolly nature, 270 Speed should be the minimum to beat Heracross. However, as Medicham won't survive any attack not named Seismic Toss regardless of defensive investment, you might as well maximize its Speed to beat the Pokemon that aim to just outrun Heracross, such as most Zapdos.</p>

<p>Many of Choice Band Medicham's counters can be neutralized by Guts users, such as Swellow and Ursaring. Dusclops and Weezing in particular like to use Will-O-Wisp, which the aforementioned Pokemon can take advantage of to sweep a team with Choice Band Facade; Medicham can help in this regard by using Brick Break for physical walls and Shadow Ball for Dusclops.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Brick Break
move 3: Shadow Ball / Rock Slide
move 4: Recover / Rock Slide
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

<p>A good general attacking Medicham, it beats Skarmory with the combination of Bulk Up and Recover. If Skarmory decides to Roar, it must first be dented-by a Bulk Up-boosted Brick Break. Recover lets Medicham stay alive against Blissey switch-ins, as Seismic Toss will otherwise eventually wear it down.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Brick Break
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Substitute / Rock Slide
move 4: Shadow Ball / Rock Slide
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This all-out attacking Medicham can take either of two routes: the safe SubPunch strategy requires minimal prediction, while Rock Slide lets it take out Salamence. However, one will need to predict well to use Focus Punch.</p>

[SET]
name: Reversal
move 1: Substitute / Endure
move 2: Reversal
move 3: Focus Punch / Bulk Up
move 4: Shadow Ball
item: Salac Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Medicham is rather beastly, but watch out for Tyranitar. Focus Punch and Bulk Up both let Reversal Medicham eliminate Skarmory. Endure is generally the superior first move as Medicham's Substitutes are very weak and won't stand up to any kind of attack; as such, it's more difficult to use Bulk Up and Substitute than simply use Bulk Up and a final Endure. Substitute works nicely with Focus Punch, however, and also serves to block status.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Psychic, ThunderPunch, and Ice Punch can hit Weezing, Gyarados, and Salamence respectively. Calm Mind helps boost Medicham's low Special Attack, and Medicham can even Baton Pass that and Bulk Up boosts. Psych Up lets Medicham take a blow from Snorlax after a few Curse boosts and either attack or heal off damage with Recover. With an Adamant nature and a Choice Band boost, Double-Edge nabs the guaranteed 2HKO on Weezing, which makes Medicham truly impossible to stall out.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Counters to Medicham include Salamence, Gyarados, Weezing, Slowbro, Dusclops, Celebi, Claydol, and Gengar, as well as Skarmory to an extent. A lot of these only counter the Choice Band variant with proper prediction, however, as none of them can take a super effective hit after switching in, except maybe Salamence and Slowbro. Crobat packs a 4x resistance to Fighting and can OHKO Medicham with Choice Band-boosted Aerial Ace, but is OHKOed in turn by Rock Slide and takes a load of damage from Shadow Ball, and even Focus Punch hurts thanks to Medicham's 720 Attack. All in all, resistances are the best way to deal with Medicham.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that, unlike Heracross, Medicham is not OHKOed by Jolly Dugtrio if it has at least 20 HP EVs, while Adamant Dugtrio can't guarantee the OHKO on even uninvested Medicham.</p>
