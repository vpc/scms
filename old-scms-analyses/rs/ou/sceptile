[Overview]

<p>Although Sceptile is one of the best stalling Pokemon in the game, this isn't all it can do. Sceptile can also pound opponents into the ground with the best Grass move in the game and its monstrous Special Attack.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSeed
move 1: Leaf Blade
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fire
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sceptile is one of the most annoying stall Pokemon in the game. The strategy is to use Leech Seed, then set up a Substitute, which drains the opponent's health and prevents it from even harming Sceptile. If the likes of Skarmory or Salamence show up, fire off Hidden Power. This set makes Blissey cry, and with a few predictions, Leaf Blade can hit the switch-in hard as Blissey switches out.</p>

<p>This set gains dramatically in effectiveness with a few layers of Spikes down, because Leech Seed forces switches, but Spikes discourage them, which puts your opponent into a catch-22 situation. The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice; there is no spread for a maximum Speed Hidden Power Fire, sadly. Regardless, you can lower Sceptile's HP IV to 3 if you'd prefer; this allows Sceptile to keep a 70 Base Power Hidden Power and maximize the percentage HP it recovers from Leech Seed.</p>

[SET]
name: Endeavor + SubPetaya
move 1: Leaf Blade
move 2: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fire
move 3: Endeavor
move 4: Substitute
item: Petaya Berry
nature: Timid
evs: 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unless your opponent has some first-rate maneuvering with Tyranitar, this Pokemon will take out at least one other foe. Endeavor ruins Blissey even at half HP. Unless you are really afraid of Aerodactyl, go with Petaya Berry.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance Mixed Sweeper
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Leaf Blade / ThunderPunch
move 3: Hidden Power Flying
move 4: Brick Break
item: Leftovers
nature: Hasty
evs: 252 Atk / 36 SpA / 220 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A fun sweeper; rather novelty, but so is Swords Dance Sceptile as a whole. A Swords Dance-boosted Brick Break can decimate Blissey and Snorlax. The choice between Leaf Blade and ThunderPunch depends on who your team fears more; Leaf Blade will do more damage to Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune, while ThunderPunch lands solid hits on Skarmory and Gyarados.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Mixed Sweeper
move 1: Leaf Blade
move 2: ThunderPunch
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Focus Punch
item: Leftovers
nature: Hasty
evs: 32 Atk / 252 SpA / 224 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This sweeper is specially based, but has Focus Punch to catch Blissey and Snorlax on the switch.</p>

[SET]
name: 200 Metagame
move 1: Leaf Blade
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fire / Protect
move 4: Toxic
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 36 HP / 252 SpA / 220 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In 200, Sceptile doesn't have the luxury of being able to use SubSeed. However, Pokemon in this metagame are less defensive as well, so Sceptile can do a lot more damage via direct attacking. Toxic allows Sceptile to cripple its best counter, Regice, on the switch. Protect helps it stall for additional Leech Seed recovery or Toxic damage, and also stops the beast of 200, Slaking.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sets that use Hidden Power Fire instead of Hidden Power Ice can make use of Dragon Claw to take down Salamence. Earthquake is novelty, but is nice against Electric-types. Crunch provides variety on specially based sets, and can deal some damage to Celebi; too bad it's illegal with Leech Seed. Safeguard can frustrate Thunder Wave Blissey, and Toxic pairs well with Leech Seed to rack up major residual damage. Pursuit is effective when Sceptile can force switches, especially against Gengar who don't want to stay in against Leech Seed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Moltres, Arcanine, Salamence, and Skarmory make good counters, as do Grass-types, particularly Celebi, Venusaur, and Ludicolo. In 200, your best bets are Metagross and Regice.</p>
