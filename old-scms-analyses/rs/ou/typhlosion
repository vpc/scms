[Overview]

<p>Typhlosion might be hard to switch in and use, but it has high Speed and hits surprisingly hard with boosts from Petaya Berry, Blaze, and STAB factored in. While Charizard—who has the same exact base stats as Typhlosion—can do a few more things than it, Typhlosion's main advantage is its access to ThunderPunch and lack of weakness to Electric.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Sweeper
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Sunny Day
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / ThunderPunch
item: Petaya Berry
nature: Timid
evs: 60 HP / 252 SpA / 12 SpD / 184 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Typhlosion hits quite hard off the bat, but once it Substitutes down to 25% HP or lower, both Blaze and Petaya Berry will activate, and together with STAB and Sunny Day, Flamethrower will rip through anything. Fire Blast is an inferior option in this case, because nothing is worse than missing when Typhlosion is about to sweep. This set works best as a late-game sweeper when counters to Typhlosion have been weakened enough for it to finish them off with Flamethrower. Hidden Power Grass deals with Swampert and the rare Quagsire, but ThunderPunch will OHKO Gyarados while getting a slightly harder hit on other Water-types. After boosts from Sunny Day and Blaze, however, Typhlosion's secondary move has to be 4x effective and the foe will have to resist Flamethrower for it to be weaker than ThunderPunch or Hidden Power Grass. ThunderPunch is also Typhlosion's only option against Flash Fire Pokemon such as Ninetales, Arcanine, and Houndoom.</p>

<p>60 HP EVs give Typhlosion a HP stat of 312, which is exactly divisible by four; this ensures that the Petaya Berry activates at exactly 25%, or after three Substitutes. The Speed EVs let Typhlosion hit 310 Speed, which beats out neutral-natured Salamence and Zapdos. Maximize Special Attack, and dump the rest in Special Defense.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: ThunderPunch / Substitute
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
nature: Rash / Mild
evs: 32 HP / 16 Atk / 252 SpA / 208 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While not as scary as the previous set, this mixed attacking set can tear holes in offensive teams with some prediction. It is admittedly somewhat difficult to use properly, but a good player can reap rich rewards. Gyarados needs to be somewhat weakened for Typhlosion to finish it off with ThunderPunch. The same for Swampert with Hidden Power Grass or Salamence with Hidden Power Ice. If you predict a switch to Regice, Blissey, or Snorlax, use Focus Punch. Substitute is usable over ThunderPunch to ease up prediction and block status.</p>

<p>Rash and Mild are the preferred natures as this is a mixed set. The EV spread is relatively simple; Special Attack is maximized, 16 Attack EVs enable Typhlosion to lay the smack down on special walls with Focus Punch, 208 EVs are invested in Speed—if using Hidden Power Ice, use 4 extra Speed EVs—and the rest is put in HP.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Typhlosion is inferior to Blaziken at running a Reversal set, as it lacks STAB on the move and has lower Attack. Counter can surprise Earthquake users, but Typhlosion has to survive the hit first. Typhlosion can itself use Earthquake to dent other Fire-types and the rare Tentacruel. Overheat works as a last-ditch effort to deal heavy damage to a threatening opponent, but it'll have to switch right back out after using it due to the Special Attack drop.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Milotic, Suicune, and Vaporeon can take Fire-type attacks easily and deal heavy damage in return with STAB Surf. Swampert must watch out for Hidden Power Grass, but also has the option of hitting Typhlosion with Earthquake under Sunny Day. Gyarados can take anything Typhlosion throws at it bar ThunderPunch and OHKO with Earthquake. Salamence and Flygon resist Flamethrower and can take Typhlosion down with Earthquake; they fear only the rare Hidden Power Ice. Snorlax and Blissey wall purely special sets, but take 50-60% from Focus Punch.</p>
