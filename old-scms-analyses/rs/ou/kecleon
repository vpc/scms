[Overview]

<p>Kecleon is cool and actually somewhat usable in OU play, with easy switch-ins on a lot of special Pokémon and the ability to screw your opponent up with moves like Trick. In UU, it can wall a ton of special hits, and can attack moderately hard with that base 90 Attack.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kecleon has a decent Attack stat in UU matches, and STAB on Return lets it really hit some Pokémon hard. When Kecleon reaches the end of its run, you can always Trick some unsuspecting Pokémon and really hurt them for the rest of the match.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Skill Swap is a nice twist, you'll probably want to use it with Shadow Ball. Kecleon doesn't really work as a special attacker overall, but you could probably nail Gyarados and Salamence. Magic Coat is a really cool move, but it's usually more reliable to just use Thunder Wave. Toxic can force things like Suicune to Rest, or Psych Up to steal Calm Minds. It can use Substitute + Focus Punch, as it has the horrible Speed to do it.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Always max Kecleon's dismal HP, it will really help it take special hits. You generally don't want to bother with Defense, so just focus on Attack and Special Defense. If you are using Substitute + Focus Punch, give Kecleon a -Speed nature to ensure you go last on the turn you Substitute, so you can Focus Punch next turn uninterrupted.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey, Suicune, etc. Anything that can abuse its ability, has high Attack, or has high HP. You can mess up most of the counters with Trick though, which just makes Kecleon even cooler.</p>
