<p>The EVs given are for if you do not have Hidden Power. If you do, you'll need 4 more Speed EVs at the cost of HP to make sure Shiftry is faster than +Speed Deoxys-A in the sun. Choice Band is helpful because Shiftry can only come in on a very limited number of Pokemon and needs to 2HKO the switch-in to survive.</p>

<p>If you feel you can set up with Shiftry, it learns Swords Dance, which is really helpful.</p>
