[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is to be used in Ubers. Shadow Ball 2HKOes Latias, Latios, Mewtwo, and the like. Knock Off lets Banette do something to its most common switch-ins: Kyogre, Forretress, and Blissey. The choice between Toxic and Will-O-Wisp depends on what kind of team you are using Banette on. A team that really has Groudon troubles will appreciate Will-O-Wisp support, whereas a stall team would rather have more opponents badly poisoned. Snatch lets Banette heal itself by Snatching moves such as Blissey's Softboiled and Aromatherapy and Lugia's Recover. If Banette uses Toxic on Blissey as it comes in, it can then use Knock Off to make Toxic that much deadlier (if their team isn't badly poisoned, your opponents won't use Aromatherapy yet if they know what they're doing), and then when you predict Softboiled, use Snatch. This will heal Banette from the Toxic damage it will likely have taken by staying in on Blissey. If you have some Spikes down, Banette can take out Blissey by stealing its Aromatherapy or Softboiled and putting it into a range of health where Spikes will do enough to KO it if it tries to switch in again.</p>
