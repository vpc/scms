[Overview]

<p>Latios is deadly with Soul Dew and awesome special stats from the bat. Versatile, powerful, and unpredictable are words that describe Latios well. Latios is nice to use over Latias for that slightly higher Special Attack stat (591 instead of 525 after Soul Dew).</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dragon Claw has no immunities, and with Safeguard + Recover + Calm Mind nothing can really hurt Latios that much. Stomps Blissey into small pieces. I wish I could suggest this set on a lot of other Pokémon, but they only get STAB on a move like Psychic which there are Pokémon immune to. Watch out for Metagross—that should be your only real worry. This set isn't seen nearly as much as the next, but with all the Toxic going around currently, this set could make a comeback, especially since Metagross is less common due to the rise of Skarmory and Kyogre. Refresh lets Latios actually switch into those statuses, and it beats Icy Wind Blissey, but it doesn't block Freeze and Sleep, and cannot be passed. It also works just that turn instead of lasting 5.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind Sweeper
move 1: Calm Mind

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The sweeper set for Latios. Has the ability to severely damage most of the uber metagame and can wall most hits with Soul Dew. Ice Beam will usually OHKO Groudon and always KO Rayquaza, and the Electric moves are for Ho-Oh and Kyogre respectively. Dragon Claw is still useful here to hit enemy Latias and Latios harder, but Ice Beam general provides more coverage.</p>

[SET]
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Recover
item: Soul Dew / Leftovers / Lum Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 108 HP / 252 Atk / 148 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Obligatory mention of an anti-uber set. Dragon Danced Shadow Ball can mess up Mewtwo and other Lati@s pretty well, while Earthquake sends Metagross and Tyranitar back to the drawing board. While it is great as a surprise, the lack of STAB really hurts in the end and Groudon will kick your butt. Soul Dew is there for the Special Defense bonus, which helps for taking Ice Beams, however you cannot be blamed for going with Leftovers or Lum Berry. Ice Beam is another option over Earthquake or Recover, to hit Groudon and Rayquaza, who otherwise laugh at this Latios. Roar is a nice option on this to pseudo-haze Calm Minders and abuse Spikes and such.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Ice Beam / Dragon Claw
move 2: Thunder / Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Dark
move 4: Recover / SolarBeam
item: Soul Dew
nature: Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When your opponent expects a less versatile Latios, this will own him. Kyogre eats a Thunder, and you can OHKO Rayquaza and most Groudon with Ice Beam. Hidden Power Fire for a nasty hit on Metagross and Shedinja, or Hidden Power Dark to still hit Shedinja, but hit other Psychics a bit harder, too. SolarBeam is useful to OHKO those annoying Groudon that are EVed to survive Latios Ice Beam. If you use SolarBeam, use Dragon Claw to hit enemy Latias and Latios harder than Ice Beam ever could.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect and Light Screen are cool to pseudo-pass, but you won't find much room on poor Latios, and Latias is better suited to the support role. If you are going to pass anything, pass Light Screen. Roar is a nice option for pseudo-hazing and Spikes abuse on any set, really, but, once again, this is more suited to Latias's greater defensive abilities. Latios can use Substitute to block Knock Off and destroy most Deoxys-D and Blissey.</p>

[EVs]

<p>307 minimum Speed for Latios. Absolute max Speed is also useful, as it beats out Jolly Rayquaza. You will want lots of Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey and Deoxys-D beat Latios without Safeguard / Substitute / Refresh. If Latios does have Safeguard, however, Blissey can set up a Light Screen and switch out to something that can now take those hits a bit better. Blissey, and, to a lesser extent, Deoxys-D can also beat Latios with Psych Up / Calm Mind and Ice Beam, depending on who gets a Critical Hit first (but remember, the Ice Beamers also have the 20% / 10% Freeze chance on their side). Alternately, Blissey with Icy Wind will also beat Safeguard Latios. Lanturn with Toxic beats Thunder / Ice Beam Latios, but loses easily to Safeguard / Dragon Claw. Snorlax can somewhat counter it (particularly Choice Band Snorlax), but has difficulties switching into those powerful special attacks, so it works much better as a Latias counter, and even then, it's not particularly good. Shedinja stops Latios without Hidden Power Fire / Dark, but if your opponent wants an all-out sweeper set, they are much more likely to choose Latios for that, and thus will be more likely to have Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Dark. The problem with relying on Shedinja is that Spikes also spell an end for the cicada. Metagross can take a few Dragon Claws and OHKO with Choice Banded Meteor Mash / Shadow Ball, but is 2HKOed by Thunder. Tyranitar can stack Special Defense to take a hit and set up, provided Latios hasn't gotten in a bunch of Calm Minds. Sand Stream also hurts Latios, who lacks Leftovers thanks to Soul Dew. Deoxys-A can come in on Recover, Calm Mind, or any other non-attacking move but Thunder Wave, and OHKO with Shadow Ball, but it needs a Choice Band or Shadow Tag to do it 100% of the time, unless you have a ton of Defense EVs.</p>
