[Overview]

<p>Welcome to the best tank in the game. Hurt by virtually nothing and sporting Recover, you are going to have a hard time killing Lugia, especially with Pressure.</p>

[SET]
name: Reflect + Toxic
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Recover
move 4: Whirlwind
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly / Timid
evs: 252 HP / 116 Def / 140 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This takes on Groudon easier than any other set, as you can switch into Swords Dance, Reflect before they have a chance to Rock Slide, Toxic, and then Whirlwind them away so they can't just Swords Dance up to +6 Attack. It outstalls Metagross with Reflect and Pressure, Whirlwinding it away any time Meteor Mash gets an Attack up.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Recover / Rest
move 4: Whirlwind
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 116 Def / 140 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Calm Mind boosts up its mediocre Special Attack and ultra high Special Defense and allows you to sweep with Lugia's amazing Speed. Rest stops Toxic Pokémon cold, but Recover is the best choice because it doesn't put you out of the fight for 2 extra turns. Whirlwind can knock other Calm Minders out of the arena, as Lugia is an excellent Whirlwinder with its amazing Defense. Watch out for Kyogre, Metagross, and Blissey. Lugia can stall them out anyway, with the exception of Metagross (Choice Band Meteor Mash hurts) and Toxic Blissey (Calm Minders and Psych Uppers lose). This used to be standard, but has since been overtaken by the previous set to take on Groudon easier, and to go along with the general stall theme so prevalent in ubers today.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Aeroblast
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Recover
move 4: Whirlwind / Reflect / Light Screen
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly
evs: 192 HP / 176 Atk / 140 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Non-boosting Lugia, still a beast. Can score some cool Critical Hits on the like of Kyogre and Blissey. Tyranitar has a tad of trouble with this Lugia as well. Lugia makes an excellent Light Screen pseudo-passer with its super Special Defense and it can Recover off the hit it sustained while setting up. Setup a screen, go to Groudon and proceed to destroy. Reflect is cool, as well.</p> 

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Aeroblast
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly
evs: 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Lugia's Speed and defenses, Choice Band perfectly complements it making all of its stats exceptional. It is the Choice Bander that never dies, so to speak. Aeroblast's critical hit rate owns with a Choice Band, Earthquake and Shadow Ball are mandatory fare and the last move is to hit Rayquaza and Groudon hard.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Whirlwind
move 4: Roar / Aeroblast / Toxic / Ice Beam
item: Leftovers
nature: Careful / Calm
evs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set looks a little strange at first. Only use with Spikes from something like Deoxys-D, Forretress, or Skarmory. A lot of people's first reaction to Lugia is to try and Toxic it, because Lugia usually has Recover and is difficult to take down normally. Rest takes care of that problem. Roar is to give a 2/3 chance of pseudo-hazing, Aeroblast for some powerful STAB (and Sleep Talk helps with the horrible PP), Ice Beam for great uber coverage (Groudon and Rayquaza, mostly), Toxic to stop Leftovers and to do real damage.</p>

<p>A fun part of this set is that Sleep Talked Whirlwind can go before the enemy if you're faster. So, as long as you're not too unlucky, you can pseudo-haze Blisseys before they heal, slow Groudon / Kyogre before they attack, etc. You could also raise your speed to 307 or more to always go before Kyogre and Groudon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You could try out a Thunder(bolt) + Ice Beam set, but Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios do that much better.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll need at least 307 Speed for Lugia on most sets, as that outspeeds the weather ubers. 280 Speed can work as well, it beats Groudon and Kyogre as long as they don't use a +Speed nature. 318 Speed (248 EVs) guarantees that you are faster than Jolly Rayquaza. 320 Speed (140 EVs and a +Speed nature) makes you faster than most Lugia, Latias, and Latios. Otherwise concentrate on its HP and defenses. Choice Banding version needs a lot of attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey and Deoxys-D can slow it down, and destroy it with Toxic, unless it has Rest (Deoxys-D can Knock Off as well). Zapdos has trouble with the Calm Mind versions, but beats others handily. Skarmory sets up on physical Lugia and those sporting Toxic as their offense. Other Lugia with Rest over Recover and Toxic, or if both are Toxic-less, they can PP stall you. Tyranitar gives it a lot of trouble. Metagross walls all of its sets except the Choice Bander, and even then, you have to predict with Earthquakes, but Reflect Lugia can PP Stall Metagross easily, taking even a CH Choice Banded Meteor Mash. Last Pokémon Kyogre stops the Calm Mind + Whirlwind version, unless you run Psychic. Since almost all Lugia run Toxic, Swellow can switch in and use Choice Banded STAB Guts Facade (which now has 140 power), which is very, very deadly. However, if Lugia has used Reflect previously, you may want to switch out, and leave Swellow as a late-game threat, or Facade won't do nearly as much as it should, and will instead just get you damaged. Taunt Mewtwo shuts down any Lugia set but the Choice Bander. Magneton can absorb anything but Earthquake and Thunderbolt Lugia back.</p>
