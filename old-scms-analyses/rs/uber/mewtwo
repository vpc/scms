[Overview]

<p>The best special sweeper in the game, most likely. Its Speed lets it outrun common foes like Latias, Latios, and Lugia. It OHKOes physical walls like Groudon with Ice Beam, drops Metagross with the threat of Flamethrower (or just uses Thunder(bolt)), and takes down Skarmory with a Fire or Electric move. It can use Substitute with 404 HP or more to stop most Blissey and Deoxys-D cold, or just use Taunt to beat it and just about any other Calm Mind user except a lucky Kyogre. This is the sole reason Choice Band Deoxys-A is on some teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It's quite easy to set up with that 101 HP Substitute. Ice Beam is generally a better option than Psychic because most Ubers are Psychic-type and Ice Beam hits about every physical attacker harder, while Calm Mind takes care of most special attackers, though Kyogre can be troublesome. Blissey doesn't have a chance at stopping you with this set, unless it has Psych Up / Calm Mind and Thunder, and even then, it's not guaranteed.</p>

move 4: Recover / Substitute

nature: Modest
evs: 104 HP / 184 SpA / 220 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is more versatile but harder to set-up because of no support moves. However, it's pretty much required to bring in Tyranitar, Psych Up Blissey, or Snorlax in on this, because Lugia, Groudon, Rayquaza and Kyogre are all hit with super effective hits. If you use Thunder you will hit Kyogre harder, but risk getting in trouble against Ho-Oh, since Ho-Oh usually comes with Drought from Groudon. Lanturn can also beat this set with Toxic if you don't have Substitute, or can Mimic Calm Mind if you do.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its large Substitutes Mewtwo can kick the crap out of Tyranitar and Blissey. Ice Beam hits Rayquaza and Groudon hard, while Flamethrower still hits Groudon for a lot of damage, but also stops Metagross, Skarmory, and Forretress. Thunderbolt (or Thunder) is for Lugia and Kyogre (who don't care about Focus Punch or Ice Beam, respectively), and also hits Metagross neutral. Shadow Ball hits any Pokémon with at least a neutral effective move when combined with Focus Punch and takes out Latias, Latios, and other Psychics.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Nothing to laugh at here. With Bulk Up, he can tear up Lugia, other Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios pretty decently with Shadow Ball. Brick Break takes care of Blissey quite decently. Substitute and Bulk Up can screw over Groudon as long as you don't let it Swords Dance too much and sweep your team. Resistance to Psychic and access to Recover makes him a great switch in on a lot of other Psychics. The last two slots are up to personal preference, really. Recover and Taunt together make for an easy set-up because you won't get status-ed or pseudo-hazed, but with Shadow Ball as your sole attack you're more prone to Metagross, Tyranitar and especially Blissey, Slaking and Snorlax. Flamethrower kills Skarmory, but Taunt will royally screw him up anyway. It also hits Metagross super effectively and does 50% more damage to Groudon thanks to Drought.</p>

<p>Another physical Mewtwo, not much to explain here. Predict switches accordingly and you should have no trouble beating everything. Blend in Fire Blast or Flamethrower to hurt Groudon and Skarmory more, it will also do a number on Metagross. Selfdestruct is great on here as well, it should kill anything that doesn't resist it, with the exception of Groudon.</p>

<p>Taunting Mewtwo can stop other Calm Minders, Lugia and Blissey cold. Calm Mind up against Latias, Latios, and the like and Taunt their attempts to Recover or Calm Mind with you. Pressure out their attacks with Recover. Calm Mind in Blissey's face as it can't do anything to your high HP with Seismic Toss. This is maybe my favorite set for Mewtwo as I love the move Taunt and Mewtwo can do a lot with it. Watch out for Tyranitar and Metagross.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Mewtwo is designed for Journey Across America, the 2v2 official Pokémon USA Tournament. The Special Defense EVs are to make it survive Kingdra's Hydro Pump guaranteed (barring a CH, of course). Shadow Ball is to hit Ghosts, Ice Beam is for Groudon and Thunder(bolt) is useful for stuff like Kyogre. Selfdestruct when you're through. Be sure to pair this will an ally that knows Protect, or, even better, Endure. If your partner has Endure, then a great strategy is to send out a Pokémon that knows Fake Out (Obi used Jynx, skarm used Persian, and Aeolus used Sneasel). The ideal Pokémon to have Enduring is <a href="http://www.smogon.com/rs/pokemon/smeargle">Smeargle</a> (set 3), as it has Spore and Endeavor. Read <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11086">this</a> for a more thorough explanation of the strategy.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Mewtwo could outstall entire stall teams, if it weren't for Pressure slowly eating away at your Taunt PP. You'll want Substitute or Taunt on this Mewtwo for sure, unless you have an Aromatherapist, so you can block enemy Toxics. Only use Flamethrower with Groudon and Thunder with Kyogre. Thunderbolt and Psychic are options if you use neither of them. Let's say your set is Toxic, Substitute, Taunt, Flamethrower, and the enemy's team contains Skarmory, Blissey, and Lugia. You bring in Mewtwo on Skarmory Spikes, and it runs to Blissey, expecting BoltBeam. You Substitute on the switch (in case Skarmory thinks it's smart by staying in to Toxic, expecting Calm Mind). You Toxic it, but they don't care because they have Blissey with Aromatherapy and Natural Cure. You use Taunt. Continue until Blissey is in KO range for Flamethrower or switches to try and get rid of Toxic. Say they switch to Lugia. You have two options here. You can Toxic if you think they're going to use something like Ice Beam or Aeroblast or whatever, or Taunt Calm Mind or Whirlwind. With those Special Defense EVs, Lugia can't break your Substitute with any special move, except Hydro Pump in the Rain, and even then, it needs Special Attack EVs. Recover gains some longevity, but Substitute is nice to Toxic things like Groudon on the switch, and then Substitute down as they keep Earthquaking, until they're in KO range. It also blocks annoying things like Thunder / Ice Beam Blissey (especially Serene Grace), Knock Off, and Exeggutor / Deoxys-A coming in after a kill. It's possible to run both Recover and Substitute, an attacking move isn't needed, but is very useful.</p>

<p>This set gains some effectiveness with Spikes, as it wears down things like Blissey faster, but they aren't needed. Wish helps out Recoverless Mewtwo.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Amnesia can outrace Calm Mind from other Pokémon. Barrier stops Groudon while you Calm Mind up. Reflect and Light Screen especially are fun to pseudo-pass; I did not make a set with them, however, as you should really use Lugia if you want to pseudo-pass. Snatch can grab Softboiled from Blissey and Calm Mind from other Pokémon, so it's an OK move. Mewtwo has better choices though.</p>

[EVs]

<p>At least 330 Speed for the Uber metagame, although Mewtwo can hit Speeds much higher if you want, and 351 is advised for outrunning Latias, Latios, and Lugia. You'll want a good amount of Special Attack and Modest; however, if you use Substitute, put in 404 HP first. Attacking Mewtwo can put less in Special Attack and more in Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Honestly, it depends on the set your opponent is running. There is no counter that will work 100% of the time against Mewtwo. Deoxys-D is a safe bet, Blissey might have troubles. Both of those are good at discovering Mewtwo's moveset without instantly dying, unlike Pokémon like Metagross, who can't risk a fire move. Once you know Mewtwo's set, it's not nearly as dangerous (but still very deadly). Deoxys-A can switch into any non-attacking move but Substitute (even Psychic from a non-Modest Mewtwo OHKOs) and OHKO with Shadow Ball, but it needs a Choice Band to do it. It can survive an unboosted Brick Break, but that is extremely rarely used. Choice Band Ho-Oh survives all of Mewtwo's attacks except maybe Selfdestruct, and can hit it hard with Choice Band Shadow Ball (potentially an OHKO), while Mewtwo's Thunderbolt is generally a 3HKO. At the very least, it can be used to scout out Mewtwo's set.</p>
