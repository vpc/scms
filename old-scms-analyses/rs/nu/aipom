[Overview]

<p>Though Aipom is certainly very cool, it's not very useful. That's a shame, but it's fun to use on favorites teams and the like.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Double-Edge
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Focus Punch
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Aipom really cannot do much damage, so Choice Band is one option. Thunder Wave can be used if you know some form of sweeper will be switching in, but that's unlikely. Its nature can either be Adamant or Jolly—whichever you wish. Pickup and Run Away are both entirely useless, so it doesn't matter which one you use.</p>

[SET]
name: Annoyer
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Thief
move 3: Sand-Attack
move 4: Astonish / Return
item: None
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Aipom can run an "annoyer" set. Annoyers don't work, and this is no exception, but with Aipom's really limited choices it was figured that this should be included. Paralyze, steal an opponent's item, lower its accuracy, and then try to flinch it with Astonish. It probably won't work, especially since they can just switch out, but that's the standard counter for any "annoyer". Return is a more reliable offensive choice.</p>

[SET]
name: SkarmBliss Counter
move 1: Beat Up
move 2: Thunder / Thunderbolt
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Counter
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 120 Spe / 136 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This only works if you load your team with Pokemon that have high base Attack stats (some good choices are Metagross, Tyranitar, and Slaking). This will make Beat Up do a ton of damage against Blissey, and with Thunder/Thunderbolt, it can also be used against Skarmory. Feel free to use any two moves for the remaining slots, but Counter and Taunt are good for kicks.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Agility
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Substitute / Snatch
item: Liechi Berry / Petaya Berry / Starf Berry
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Substitute can be used to activate your Berry, as you are faster than anything after an Agility. Taunt attempts at Hazing and phazing. Snatch can be a nice surprise for that Pokemon that thinks Aipom is setup bait, and might even let it pass something useful, like Calm Minds or Swords Dances.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aipom is really limited in its options and not really usable in the standard environment. You can use it as the recipient in a Baton Pass chain for fun, but the same can be said for anything but Ditto and Unown.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any kind of sweeper like Aerodactyl and Salamence can easily handle Aipom, but the little monkey can be annoying when it gives those fast sweepers a Thunder Wave. Basically any standard Pokemon can defeat Aipom with little trouble.</p>
