[Overview]

<p>Farfetch'd isn't good, plain and simple. It can't hurt anything unless you get really lucky.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Uh oh, it's Farfetch'd! Actually to be honest, "Uh oh" is what you say when you bring out Farfetch'd because it's a terrible Pokémon. Swords Dance + Slash + critical hit will hurt a lot of stuff, but I doubt you will even get that far because everything and anything kills Farfetch'd easily. Knock Off is to hit Skarmory or Gengar or such on the switch.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Attract
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Agility
move 4: Baton Pass
item: Leftovers
ability: Inner Focus
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 198 Spe / 60 Def
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You are going to have to rely heavily on luck for this, as this is the only way Farfetch'd will actually complete a Baton Pass without dying or being pseudo-hazed out. I don't recommend this set.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance + Flail
move 1: Substitute / Endure
move 2: Flail
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost
move 4: Swords Dance
item: Salac Berry
ability: Inner Focus
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>He can't even reach 396 Speed with Salac Berry. Stick to Dodrio for this set.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It can Wish + Protect if you are into pseudo passing healing, and Yawn... however on the flipside, it can do neither effectively. Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying works if you want a Flying move to take advantage off STAB of... uh.. Farfetch'd's horrible Attack.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll want max Attack and Speed for most sets, Baton Passing one with Agility only needs 198 Speed and lots of defenses.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Aside from everything, Skarmory gets special note.</p>
