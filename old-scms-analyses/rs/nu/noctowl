[Overview]

<p>Well, it's Noctowl. It isn't that great, but hey, it's an owl. That's cool, right? Anyway, its main assets are its HP and Special Defense, and that sets it apart from a lot of other UUs, who are sorely lacking in the Defense department. If you're looking for a UU that can actually take some hits, try Noctowl, but don't use it in OU play and expect it to do much.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Probably Noctowl's best moveset. Hypnosis is to put them to Sleep, obviously, which is always a good thing. Psychic is one of its better attacking moves and is good for Weezing and Breloom, both of whom you can switch into fairly safely. Whirlwind because Noctowl has the HP to pseudo-haze. Reflect helps shore up Noctowl's inferior Defense stat, and provides walling for the whole team.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Return / Double-Edge
move 2: Aerial Ace

item: Choice Band
ability: Insomnia
nature: Adamant / Jolly

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Noctowl. Return or Double-Edge is a power vs. recoil argument. It can't do much to Skarmory no matter what he has, so just tail in when big bad metal birdie comes in. Pair it with Magneton and it might not completely suck. Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fighting is for Tyranitar, Steelix, and compadres.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Faint Attack
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Hypnosis / Toxic
item: Leftovers
ability: Insomnia
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Special Attacking Noctowl set. I'd recommend Hypnosis, but that's just me. Not too bad, better than Choice Band Noctowl, as its Special Attack is actually pretty good.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Noctowl doesn't have many options outside of the sets listed. You could use Rest if you want to taunt your opponent.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For the Choice Band and Special Attacking sets, jack up either Attack or Special Attack to max, then do the same to its Speed and give it a Jolly or Timid nature, depending on which set you are using. For the main set, you're going to want to put quite a bit into HP and Special Defense, then the rest in Defense and Special Attack. Its decent Special Defense and HP is one of the reasons it can actually survive for quite a while.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a STAB Rock move will easily KO Noctowl. Jolteon, Zapdos, Raikou etc. will all scare it away, as will Lapras, Articuno and other Ice types. Just don't keep it in vs. STAB Electric and Ice moves and you should be okay.</p>
