[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Baton Passing Ledian. He learns some decent moves in Swords Dance and Agility, and with his above average Special Defense can take a hit from Alakazam and hit it back with a Swords Danced Silver Wind. Ledian is decently fast, so if you can switch it into... uh... a Choice Band Brick Break or Earthquake, it can start to setup. Skarmory will obviously stop you... but... LEDIAN LEARNS THUNDERPUNCH! DENIED.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Special Attacking Ledian loses STAB, but takes advantage of Ledian's slightly more diverse movepool and higher stat. Hidden Power Dark is mostly for Chimecho.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It can catch Wigglytuff on the switch with Focus Punch and maybe do about 50% damage. Toxic can be used to do some indirect damage while stalling with Ledian's high Special Defense.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Ledian should usually have max HP and a defensive spread. Some attacking spreads, however, may find it useful to go with more offensive EVs.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a physical attack, especially a Rock move.</p>
