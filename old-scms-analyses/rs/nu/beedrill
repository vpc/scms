[Overview]

<p>Beedrill has bad stats all around, no real special movepool, and a poor physical one. Its typing does very little to benefit it as well. It is really only usable in NU, where it is still outclassed by other Pokemon. The Endeavor set, for example, is just a worse Raticate.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band set, probably the best you will get with Beedrill on most teams. It can't really damage much and cannot switch into anything without prediction, but it is faster than stuff like Breloom... Only use Twineedle if you really want Hidden Power Rock to hit Flying-types and other Bug-types, as Twineedle isn't that powerful.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Endure / Agility / Brick Break
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Hidden Power Bug
move 4: Sludge Bomb
item: Liechi Berry / Salac Berry / Scope Lens
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A pathetic sweeper, this usually won't even survive one hit to setup. You'll need most of the other team's Pokemon to be paralyzed for this to even START sweeping. Leftovers is not suggested because this set has NO sort of survivability. If you are using Salac Berry, don't use any Speed EVs, but rather, pump one of the defenses or HP to give Beedrill a chance to survive a hit while it Swords Dances.</p>

[SET]
name: Endeavor
move 1: Endeavor
move 2: Substitute / Endure
move 3: Hidden Power Bug
move 4: Sludge Bomb
item: Liechi Berry / Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Spe / 252 Atk / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you want to use an Endeavor team and don't want to use the slowpokes (Swampert and Aggron), this is always an option. As always, Substitute down to as close to 1 HP as possible and watch Beedrill do the most damage you'll ever see in your life. This is the only way to get an almost guaranteed kill out of Beedrill. Do NOT put the last 4 EVs into HP, or you will not be able to Substitute the fourth time.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Max Attack and Speed. Most of the time, 252 / 252 / 4 spreads aren't very effective, but no matter how much Defense you put on Beedrill, it won't live through anything. On the Endeavor set, make sure that the 4 leftover EVs do not go into HP, as you want to be able to Substitute down 4 times for it to work optimally. You could also run 8 HP to get down to exactly 1 HP, if you are that meticulous, but it's not necessary, and it forces you to take EVs out of Attack or Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In NU, Beedrill's STAB moves are resisted by other Poison-types like Ariados and enemy Beedrill. Whiscash and Piloswine take it on easily as well thanks to their Sludge Bomb resistance. Pidgeot and Murkrow do the same if they can get in without being hit hard by Sludge Bomb, or in Murkrow's case, Bug moves as well, both threatening to OHKO with Drill Peck. Togetic's Defense isn't the best, so Sludge Bomb might hurt, but a Hustle-boosted Aerial Ace or a Fire Blast still hurts a lot. Magcargo has great Defense and the type advantage over both Beedrill's STAB options and can OHKO with a Fire move. Relicanth and Sudowoodo resist Sludge Bomb and can Rock Slide Beedrill to death. Torkoal easily takes some blows and can counterattack with a Fire move as well. Mawile has Intimidate, resists Bug, and is immune to Poison, so it can set up some boosts to Baton Pass to another Pokemon or just kill Beedrill outright.</p>

<p>For the Endeavor set, carefully watch your switches and preferably finish off Beedrill with Quick Attack, ExtremeSpeed, Fake Out (watch out for Endure), or a similar move. Killing it with a faster Pokemon and not allowing it to get in a Substitute (Rock Blast and other multi-hit moves can help with this) is generally the best way.</p>
