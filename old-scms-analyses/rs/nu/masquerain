[Overview]

<p>Masquerain can't do any damage, and it's not worth it at all. Please, you're better off with Butterfree and Ledian. However, if you were dared to use this or maybe perhaps you lost a bet, you should try to paralyze as much as you can and, if you have a sure fire way to OHKO, even though chances are you won't, go for it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best moveset for Masquerain. It will have to Stun Spore everything in sight. The huge problem with Masquerain is its movepool; it has absolutely no attacks that work off of its Special Attack, its better offense stat. Substitute will probably be the best filler for that annoying last move, but Giga Drain can screw something. It won't do much, and don’t expect it to get a KO in the early stages of the game.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Don't even try a Toxic + Protect set. You won't get anywhere with that. Stick with the script and use Stun Spore.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Just go with max Special Attack and Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything. Masquerain will need luck in order to kill something, but your opponent won't need any luck at all to take it down.</p>
