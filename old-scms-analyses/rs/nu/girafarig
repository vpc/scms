[Overview]

<p>Girafarig is horrible, but can be used as a diverse Baton Pass user in the UU environment. Its typing is unique, letting it lose the Ghost weakness due to its Normal-type side. I wouldn't recommend this, though.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind + Baton Pass
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Calm Mind
move 4: Baton Pass
item: Leftovers
ability: Early Bird
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Not really good, but Girafarig itself isn't good. Pass Calm Minds to other Pokémon or attempt to sweep after some Calm Minds with Girafarig itself. Girafarig can't do much more than this.</p>

[SET]
name: WishPasser
move 1: Calm Mind / Agility
move 2: Wish
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Baton Pass
item: Leftovers
ability: Early Bird
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Once again, you Baton Pass either Calm Minds or Agilities as well as Substitutes and Wishes. It can't attack at all, as you see, but it can make some good support if used right. Of course there are far better options, but this gives you some diversity in what you can actually Baton Pass.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wish is generally superior to Rest, but with Early Bird, you only sleep for one turn. Reflect and Light Screen passing is another good option for Girafarig because it is so horrible to begin with. Girafarig can hit most phazers with Thunderbolt.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Focus on Girafarig's HP and defenses so it can stay alive long enough to get off the Baton Pass.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Almost anything. Anything that's faster and with enough Attack to OHKO Girafarig is a counter. Anything with enough Special Defense to take a hit from Girafarig and then OHKO it is a counter.</p>
