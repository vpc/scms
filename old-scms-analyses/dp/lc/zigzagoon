[Overview]

<p>Game Freak seems to be teasing us by giving us an evolutionary line with the holy trinity of sweeping power—Belly Drum, Gluttony, and a STAB ExtremeSpeed; yet not allowing poor little Zigzagoon to legally have one of the key elements of the ultimate one-turn setup: Gluttony. Tack on its paltry 240 Base Stat total, the 27th worst of all 493 Pokemon, and you have yourselves an underwhelming tiny raccoon. Yet even with these setbacks, Zigzagoon has found its own little niche in the Little Cup metagame. It wields the power of Belly Drum and the strongest reliable priority in all of the Little Cup, giving it a special little spot in all of our little hearts.</p>

<p>With the discovery of the Pomeg Glitch, Zigzagoon can finally run the coveted combination of Belly Drum and ExtremeSpeed. The idea is simple: Substitute on a forced switch, then use Belly Drum to put Zigzagoon into Salac Berry range. This boosts its below-average Speed of 15 to a blazing 22, outrunning every single Pokemon in Little Cup not holding a Choice Scarf. At the same time, Zigzagoon's Attack soars to 52. You are then free to rip anything that doesn't resist its STAB 80 Base Power priority ExtremeSpeed to shreds.</p>

<p>Zigzagoon's physical movepool leaves room for only one coverage option: Seed Bomb. Gastly who neglect to hold a Choice Scarf and Rock Polish Aron have a small chance to be OHKOed by a Belly Drum boosted Seed Bomb, but even then only after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Dumping all EVs into Speed and Attack, along with an Adamant nature, allows for maximum damage while attempting a sweep. The leftover EVs are included to increase Zigzagoon's bulk. The reason they are not included in its HP is because with no HP EVs it hits 20 HP. Having a HP divisible by four is great for Substitute + Salac Berry sweepers, as it means they will be left with 25% of their HP when their Berry activates.</p>

<p>Zigzagoon isn't one of those Pokemon you can just throw on your team without thought; it requires a lot of support in order to be effective. Its frail 20/11/11 defensive stats, especially with the Normal-type's lack of resistances, rarely allow it to set up a Substitute and not have it broken first. Wynaut can help Zigzagoon out by giving it free turns to set up with its good defenses, Encore, and Shadow Tag.</p>

<p>Bronzor and Scarfed Ghost-types such as Gastly pose the largest threats to Zigzagoon with their ability to take boosted ExtremeSpeeds and OHKO back with their respective attacks. Munchlax is an option to take care of these Pokemon. It can hit Bronzor with Fire Punch and any Ghost-types with Pursuit. Choice Scarf Cranidos also does a good job at removing these threats while still keeping an offensive momentum going thanks to its ability, Mold Breaker, which allows it to hit Bronzor and Gastly with Earthquake for super effective damage. Stunky and Diglett also make great partners, as they can trap and kill the Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-types that threaten Zigzagoon. Wynaut also does a good job by trapping Bronzor and Choice Scarf Gastly on a Sludge Bomb.</p>

<p>While Zigzagoon normally functions as a Belly Drum sweeper, Life Orb Zigzagoon acts as a great revenge killer in a metagame filled with frail sweepers. Even with a relatively low 13 Attack, Zigzagoon can revenge kill many of the omnipresent threats in Little Cup with the strongest reliable priority in Little Cup after a Life Orb boost. Common threats such as Life Orb Croagunk, Choice Scarf Houndour, Guts Taillow, and Substitute Carvanha are always OHKOed by a Life Orb ExtremeSpeed, provided that Stealth Rock is on the field.</p>

<p>The other moves come from Zigzagoon's extensive special movepool typical of Normal-types. Shadow Ball does a number to most Ghost switch-ins trying to absorb ExtremeSpeeds. After Stealth Rock, it has a chance to OHKO Gastly. Ice Beam hits many of the physically defensive Ground-types who like to switch in to sponge ExtremeSpeeds and does respectable damage to Drifloon. It OHKOes Gligar and 2HKOes Hippopotas, even through Oran Berry. In the last spot, Substitute can help you scout out switches so it becomes easier to OHKO certain Pokemon with Zigzagoon's assorted special moves. Seed Bomb gives it a chance to hit the dual Water/Rock-types such as Omanyte and Kabuto for heavy damage. Surf can also be used to hit Aron if your team desperately needs to check it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pokemon who can take advantage of the absence of frail sweepers benefit greatly from Life Orb Zigzagoon. With its excellent Attack stat and great dual STABs, Carvanha can hurt everything slower than it with Crunch or Waterfall. Misdreavus also can benefit from Life Orb Zigzagoon. With its 19 Speed counterparts such as Gligar and other Misdreavus out of the way, Misdreavus can finish off teams with a selected move. Eevee is another interesting option because its counters are exactly the same as Zigzagoon's. Eevee is stopped cold by Bronzor, Ghost-types, and Rock-types. Zigzagoon can get rid of these threats or weaken them to a point where Eevee can break through and proceed to sweep.</p>

<p>Max Attack, Speed, and an Attack-boosting nature lets ExtremeSpeed hit as hard as possible and net the KOs listed earlier. The extra EVs are dumped into Special Attack so that Shadow Ball and Ice Beam hit harder; it's not like Zigzagoon is taking attacks any time soon. The 16 EVs placed in HP put Zigzagoon at 19 HP, which minimizes the damage sustained from Life Orb.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Zigzagoon's special movepool is massive, its Special Attack is most definitely not. Other than the moves listed in the Life Orb set, using special attacks will do nothing more than hit a select few targets harder than its regular moveset. This could be useful if your team has certain needs, but are usually not enough to warrant a moveslot. Thunder Wave is an interesting option, but more often than not you'll be better off setting up a Substitute or hitting something with ExtremeSpeed. A Choice Band set is viable, but the number of Ghosts in the tier severely hinder its ability to do much. Zigzagoon does get Trick and Switcheroo to ruin any initial switch-ins, though.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bronzor is the number one counter to Zigzagoon. It walls everything the raccoon can throw at it and then some. It can then proceed to set up Stealth Rock in its face or set up Reflect and Light Screen for an opposing sweeper to take advantage of. Scarfers that can survive a +6 ExtremeSpeed such as Gastly also make good choices, since they can easily outpace Zigzagoon and KO it.</p>

<p>Other than that, you really shouldn't be switching out of Zigzagoon. The best strategy is just to attack it with what you have. Chances are that you will break its Substitute and render it useless, outside of firing off mediocre ExtremeSpeeds without a Life Orb boost. Facing a Life Orb set can be somewhat more difficult. The ability to immediately fire off powerful ExtremeSpeeds is threatening to many Pokemon. Again, Bronzor is a great immediate switch-in, as well as Rock-types such as Omanyte and Kabuto. Just beware of Seed Bomb.</p>
