[Overview]

<p>When used effectively, Shroomish can make your opponent rip their hair out in frustration. Despite its poor base stats and movepool, Shroomish can make use of its ability, Poison Heal, to be somewhat successful. Shroomish boasts one of the most annoying sets in all of Little Cup, and this is one of the few sets that can stall in Little Cup. After setting up, Shroomish is very difficult to revenge kill, as it sports useful resistances to Electric-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks. Poison Heal, in tandem with Toxic Orb, allows Shroomish to regain HP even without Leech Seed, though Leech Seed must be up to effectively stall out your opponent. Though it can pull off this one set with great success, it falters in many other areas. Its inability to hit the opponent hard is its biggest weakness, so it cannot be relied upon to break any walls with sheer force.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a combination of good typing, a wonderful ability, and decent defenses, Shroomish is able to cause havoc easily with its SubSeed set. The main idea of the set is to switch in on a resisted attack and either Substitute or Spore the Pokemon coming in on the switch. From there, Shroomish uses a combination of the HP it receives from Poison Heal and Leech Seed to stall out the opposition. This is even easier to carry out thanks to the plethora of Pokemon abusing Choice items in Little Cup.</p>

<p>With 25 HP, 16 Defense, and 14 Special Defense, Shroomish can run arguably the most effective SubSeeding set in all of Little Cup. This set achieves its goal by using a combination of Substitute and Protect to make sure that the opponent cannot touch you, while draining their health with Leech Seed and restoring your own. Spore allows Shroomish to put the opponent to sleep 100% of the time, allowing for easy setup.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Shroomish's plethora of resistances to the common attacking types in Little Cup help it easily switch in and set up. Once in, Shroomish can safely put the opponent to sleep with Spore and begin the stalling cycle. Use Substitute on the switch and Leech Seed as the opponent breaks your Substitute. Then, simply alternate between Substitute and Protect to drain your opponent's HP until it is KOed.</p>

<p>Despite Shroomish's resistances, its Grass typing gives it several weaknesses as well. Be wary of Ice-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks when attempting to set up. Ghosts can cause huge problems if they haven't been hit by Leech Seed, as they can easily outpace and KO Shroomish with a STAB Shadow Ball. A dual screen user, such as Bronzor, can help Shroomish take hits better, and Munchlax makes a great partner for Shroomish thanks to its great bulk and ability to counter troublesome Ghosts with Pursuit. Shroomish also has trouble with Wynaut since it has Encore.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf Lead
move 1: Spore
move 2: Energy Ball
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Stun Spore 
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Effect Spore
nature: Timid
evs: 36 HP / 196 SpA / 36 Def / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While giving a Choice Scarf to such a slow Pokemon may seem silly, the boost gives Shroomish the magic 21 Speed, which allows it to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon. This makes Shroomish a very effective anti-lead, allowing it to outrun and sleep any non-Scarfed Pokemon with its 100% accurate Spore. This set can prevent most leads from setting up Stealth Rock. It can immobilize many top leads, including Hippopotas, Meowth, and Snover, simply by using Spore on them. Neither Snover's Ice Shard nor Meowth's Fake Out will ever OHKO Shroomish, allowing it to safely incapacitate them with Spore. Energy Ball allows Shroomish to deal with leads such as Diglett, Hippopotas, Phanpy, Kabuto, and Omanyte. Sludge Bomb gives Shroomish some extra coverage while Stun Spore is convenient for paralyzing Pokemon like Gligar.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Shroomish doesn't have a fantastic movepool, but it can run a physical moveset as well. Seed Bomb may be used over Energy Ball to hit specially defensive Pokemon harder while Return complements it for extra coverage. Wake-Up Slap can be used to hit Snover, Houndour, and Aron a bit harder. Hidden Power Ice can also be used to kill Gligar. Shroomish's main objective is to use Spore against the opponent; if it can't OHKO the opposing lead, it should Spore to prevent the opposing lead from setting up. If the lead switches to take the hit, it ends up being slept rather than taking minimal damage. Choice Scarf Shroomish faces some competition from Choice Scarf Venonat. However, Venonat has Sleep Powder which, after Compoundeyes, only has 97.5% accuracy as opposed to Shroomish's 100% accurate Spore. Venonat also lacks Energy Ball, which is very useful in the lead position for dealing with common Ground- and Water-type leads. After its use in the lead position, Shroomish can revenge kill certain Pokemon that are weak to Energy Ball or use Spore on another target if the other Pokemon has fainted. Toxic can be also used to cripple a Pokemon, but seeing as Little Cup is a very fast paced metagame, it would be of little use.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Shroomish pairs up well with Houndour, as Houndour can absorb the Fire-type attacks thrown at Shroomish with Flash Fire. Chinchou can switch into nearly all attacks that Shroomish is weak to and set up. Keep in mind that Shroomish cannot set up Stealth Rock, so if the team strongly benefits from a Stealth Rock user, something like Bronzor or Omanyte may be used.</p>

<p>Any Choice Scarfed lead, such as Mankey and Gastly, will beat this set. Leads with Lum Berry can take Shroomish's Spore and and KO with any attack. Houndour that run Early Bird and Sucker Punch can also take Shroomish down. Leads with priority can significantly damage Shroomish, but generally cannot OHKO it due to its reasonable defenses.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Shroomish has a horrible movepool and does not have many options outside of the moves listed in the Shroom Stall set. Shroomish can attempt to use a moveset consisting of Spore and Wake-Up Slap in order to have a 120 Base Power move while the opponent is sleeping, but most sleeping opponents will switch out. You may also attempt to use Toxic on the Shroom Stall set instead of Spore to speed up the stalling process. Instead of using Spore, it is possible to chose to attack the opponent instead of putting it to sleep. Seed Bomb offers a reliable STAB move, while Facade could prove valuable once poisoned. Sludge bomb may be used if you would like to hit Grass-types, most notably Snover, for super effective damage.</p>

<p>Shroomish can run a Choice Scarf set fairly well. With 236 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature it hits the magic Speed number of 14. This allows Shroomish to outrun any Pokemon without a Choice Scarf and put them to sleep with Spore. Unfortunately, with base 40 Attack and 40 Special Attack, Shroomish can't do much except for revenge kill weakened Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Shroomish is countered by any heavy hitter who is faster than it, as they will likely KO Shroomish before it has a chance to set up. Since Shroomish has no way to defend itself with attacking options, any Pokemon running Substitute can avoid being stalled by Leech Seed. If you can predict when Shroomish will use Protect, you can then switch in a Pokemon to break its Substitute and hit it hard next turn. Meowth makes a great Shroomish counter, as it can break Shroomish's Substitute with Fake Out and then hit it with U-turn. Basically, destroying Shroomish's Substitute leaves it vulnerable to faster threats, so if Shroomish is not behind a Substitute, you should have no trouble dispatching it. Grass-types in particular have no trouble with Shroomish, as they aren't affected by Leech Seed. Dratini also poses huge problems for Shroomish, as its ability, Shed Skin, effectively combats the effect of Spore.</p>
