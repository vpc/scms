<p>Staryu has a fantastic offensive movepool, with moves that give it excellent type coverage. It reaches one of the fastest Speed benchmarks in the LC metagame, that being a high 19. Lastly, it has a decent Special Attack stat of 16, enough to make full use of its brilliant movepool. These qualities make Staryu one of the best late-game sweepers available in Little Cup.</p>

<p>Hydro Pump is the STAB move of choice, as it packs 26% more power than Surf. While the 80% accuracy can be an issue, it gives the crucial power needed to OHKO many opponents, and does enough damage to 3HKO the common Munchlax (including Oran Berry). If you dislike Hydro Pump's 80% accuracy, you have a reliable alternative in Surf, which is still capable of dealing heavy damage to most foes. Thunderbolt offers great coverage in tandem with Surf, hitting Water-types like Mantyke for super effective damage. Ice Beam is used to stop Grass-types such as Paras. Finally, Hidden Power Ground hits Croagunk and Chinchou, two common Pokémon capable of stopping Staryu's sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Munchlax threatens nearly every special attacker with its high HP and Special Defense stats, which means Staryu will have a hard time getting past it. There are several ways to take down Munchlax. Fighting-types such as Mankey and Machop can take out Munchlax easily with their STAB attacks. Ghosts with Will-O-Wisp, such as Duskull and Misdreavus, can also lure and/or cripple Munchlax with a burn, making it hard for Munchlax to hit Staryu effectively. Priority users also threaten Staryu, as they can circumvent Staryu's Speed advantage and hit its mediocre defenses hard. Meowth, Croagunk, and Houndour are some of the most common priority users in the LC metagame and each hit hard with their STAB priority moves. Duskull easily switches into Meowth's Fake Out, and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Gligar can switch into Croagunk’s priority moves with impunity, and OHKOs with Earthquake. Finally, Munchlax switches into Houndour's STAB Fire Blast easily with Thick Fat and high Special Defense, and can return fire with a powerful STAB Return.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its fantastic 19 Speed, above-average 16 Special Attack, and wide offensive movepool, Staryu is one of the best Rapid Spin users available in the LC metagame. On top of this, it can also double as an effective late-game sweeper once your opponent's Pokémon are weakened, effectively filling two roles at once.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin removes opposing entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, from the field. However, Staryu's efficiency comes primarily from its offensive moves, as it has enough power to threaten Ghost-types that would switch in to block Rapid Spin, such as Gastly and Misdreavus. Surf is the preferred STAB move, as it provides reliable power in the lead position. However, Hydro Pump allows Staryu to OHKO certain opponents, such as Gastly and Abra, and also provides more power for a potential late-game sweep. Thunderbolt provides secondary coverage, hitting Mantyke and other Water-types. For the last slot, Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Grass-types, particularly Dratini and Paras, very hard, while Hidden Power Ground hits Croagunk and Chinchou.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The two items that are recommended for use are Oran Berry and Focus Sash. Since Staryu packs decent overall bulk, it can make use of Oran Berry, as it gives Staryu more survivability. On the other hand, Focus Sash helps it against leads that can score an OHKO on Staryu, such as Voltorb and Magnemite.</p>

<p>Staryu will have a huge amount of trouble against Fake Out leads, especially Meowth and Aipom. Both of these Pokémon can potentially beat Staryu with their STAB attacks without taking a hit, putting Staryu in a tight situation when it’s up against them. Snover, a common LC lead, resists both Surf and Thunderbolt and takes neutral damage from Ice Beam, allowing it to finish off Staryu with its STAB Grass-type moves. To deal with these threats, Aron can be used as it threatens all three. It resists all of their STAB attacks (barring Wood Hammer/Energy Ball from Snover) and generally doesn’t mind any other move they use, aside from the uncommon Brick Break from Aipom, and can set up Stealth Rock or Rock Polish safely. Houndour will almost always come out on top of Snover, Pursuiting it for heavy damage if it decides to flee or scorching it with Fire Blast if it stays in. Ghost-types like Misdreavus can come in on Aipom and Meowth to absorb Fake Out and proceed to dispose of them with Hidden Power Fighting or crippling their Attack with Will-O-Wisp; however, Meowth’s Bite and Aipom's Payback should be looked out for. Aside from helping Staryu deal with what it can’t hurt, Pokémon who appreciate a Stealth Rock-free battlefield should be considered. Taillow and Houndour are two very threatening Pokémon, but have a hindering Stealth Rock weakness, which limits the amount of times they can switch in. With Stealth Rock out of the way, they can safely switch in without worry and attempt to wreak havoc with Guts boosted Facades and powerful Fire Blasts, respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Choiced Sweeper
move 1: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Ground
item: Choice Specs / Choice Scarf
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 36 HP / 200 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Instead of Staryu becoming a late-game sweeper with Life Orb, it can also be a very strong attacker with Choice Specs equipped, or an effective revenge killer by holding Choice Scarf. With Choice Specs and a Timid nature, Staryu reaches an excellent Special Attack stat of 24, enough for it to deal heavy damage to almost any foe. On the other hand, Staryu reaches a fantastic Speed stat of 27 with Choice Scarf and a Modest nature, outpacing all positive natured base 80 Pokémon who wield Choice Scarf themselves.</p>

<p>Hydro Pump is an excellent STAB move to use, especially if you opt to use Choice Specs. With Choice Specs, it becomes strong enough to 2HKO the bulkiest version of Munchlax, and 3HKO if Oran Berry is still intact. Also, Staryu becomes a frightening Choice Scarf sweeper with Hydro Pump, OHKOing Pokémon like Gastly and Meowth. Surf is another move Staryu can use if you dislike Hydro Pump's accuracy, hitting reasonably hard against Pokémon who are weak to it or pack low defenses. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are excellent attacks to use in conjunction with Staryu's STAB move, as the former nails Water-types, such as Mantyke, while the latter penetrates Grass-types, such as Paras and Turtwig. Hidden Power Ground rounds off the set very nicely, eliminating Chinchou and Croagunk, two huge threats to Staryu.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Munchlax is once again a big threat to Staryu, mainly because its defensive stats allow it to take several special hits fired off from Staryu, giving it the chance to finish it off with a powerful STAB Return. Getting rid of Munchlax before sending out Staryu is strongly recommended, so using Fighting-types or Will-O-Wisp users to reduce Munchlax's threat is advised. Croagunk is a great example of a Fighting-type that can OHKO Munchlax easily with Cross Chop, while Duskull can shrug off anything Munchlax throws at it thanks to its high Defense stat, allowing it to cripple Munchlax with Will-O-Wisp. Besides dealing with Munchlax, it’s generally recommended to have Pokémon who can deal with the Pokémon who can be devastating after gaining a free switch in from being immune or resistant to one of Staryu's attacks, at least when using Staryu with a Choice item. For example, Gligar can switch into Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ground and score a free Swords Dance or Rock Polish boost, or Mantyke can switch into Surf or Hidden Power Ground and pull off an Agility or Rain Dance. To deal with these big threats, Phanpy and Chinchou deserve consideration. Phanpy's great physical bulk and access to Ice Shard makes it a prime candidate to dispose of Gligar, while Chinchou's typing helps it resist nearly every move Mantyke uses, allowing Chinchou to obliterate it with Thunderbolt.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>The common Substitute + pinch Berry combination works pretty well on Staryu, as with a boost and its naturally high Speed and decent Special Attack it can be a very threatening sweeper. By using Petaya Berry, Staryu is capable of reaching a Special Attack stat of 24, and with its excellent type coverage, your opponent will have a hard time combating it if they lack a priority user or a Pokémon who is faster than it.</p>

<p>Staryu is also capable of using Gravity to great effect. Not only does it give Staryu's Blizzard, Hydro Pump, and Thunder 100% accuracy, it also helps any teammate relying on a powerful Earthquake, especially Gligar. With Gravity active, Gligar and other Ground-type attackers can use Earthquake without of a Flying or Levitating Pokémon stopping its sweep.</p>

<p>Since Staryu generally forces several switches, Recover can be useful, especially on the Life Orb set. With it, Staryu can heal up 50% of its HP that it has lost from the Life Orb recoil, giving it more longevity to sweep. Pain Split can still be used to some effectiveness on the Life Orb set as well. This gives Staryu the ability to heal itself up to nearly maximum health when it’s running low on HP from Life Orb recoil, and it works very well against the likes of Bronzor and Munchlax because of their large HP stat.</p>

<p>With Croagunk being a common Staryu switch-in because of its ability to absorb Water-type attacks and recover 25% HP, Psychic is a perfectly viable option to use against it, hitting it for 4x damage. Not only does it destroy Croagunk, but other Fighting-types like Machop and Mankey will never like to take Psychic either. Hidden Power Grass is a decent alternative to Hidden Power Ground, as it obliterates Wooper, Barboach, Omanyte, and Kabuto, all of which can be troublesome. Hidden Power Fire may also be used, taking out Snover and also having a chance to deal heavy damage to Croagunk because of its Dry Skin ability.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In almost all situations, Munchlax will be able to threaten Staryu, thanks to its great special bulk and access to a powerful STAB Return. Chinchou, although it lacks the defenses Munchlax boasts, resists and is capable of shrugging off Surf, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. It can then set up an Agility and attempt to wreak havoc; however, it should watch out for Hidden Power Ground which deals 75% - 91.67% to standard Chinchou. Snover is another excellent counter to Staryu, as it is resistant to Surf, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Ground, allowing it to switch in and smack Staryu with STAB Energy Ball. Wooper is immune to Thunderbolt, can absorb 25% of its health upon switching into a predicted Surf, and can hurt Staryu with a STAB Earthquake.</p>

<p>Priority users can cause serious troubles to Staryu, as its mediocre defenses can’t stand up to repeated assaults of priority moves. Fake Out and Vacuum Wave Croagunk and Sucker Punch Houndour are just some of the priority users that can severely damage Staryu. In Croagunk’s case, it’s capable of doing upwards of 70% damage with a combination of a Life Orbed Fake Out and Vacuum Wave, while max Attack positive natured Houndour with Life Orb has a 46% chance to OHKO Staryu with Sucker Punch if Stealth Rock is in play.</p>
