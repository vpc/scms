[Overview]

<p>Totodile is a solid option for a Water-type in Little Cup. It has fairly good stats, access to both Swords Dance and Dragon Dance and STAB Aqua Jet. A Totodile that has set up can be difficult to stop without a check or counter such as Croagunk on your team. However, Totodile does have some problems setting up without dual screen support. Still, you don't want to underestimate this little crocodile. The only word that can describe a Totodile sweep is "Crikey!"</p>

[SET]

move 2: Aqua Jet

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is probably Totodile's most dangerous set. After one turn of set up, Totodile becomes a huge threat with Return and STAB Aqua Jet.</p>

<p>To show how powerful a Life Orb and Swords Dance boosted Aqua Jet is, here are some calculations:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>+2 Aqua Jet vs. 36/36 Aron 109.09% - 136.36%</li>
<li>+2 Aqua Jet vs. 236/236 Gligar 76.92% - 100.00%</li>
<li>+2 Aqua Jet vs. 196/116 Phanpy 92.86% - 114.29%</li>
<li>+2 Aqua Jet vs. 220/148 Bronzor 48.00% - 60.00%</li>
</ul>

<p>The last moveslot is up to personal preference. Crunch is great, as it allows Totodile to OHKO Duskull and Slowpoke. However, Ice Punch allows you to hit bulky Grass-types such as Shroomish and Paras harder, who would love to put Totodile to sleep. Ice Punch also hits Ground-types, in particular Gligar, harder than Aqua Jet does. Waterfall provides Totodile with a stronger STAB and hits anything that does not resist it for a lot of damage. A Jolly nature is recommended, but not only because of the added Speed; if you run an Adamant nature, you have to sacrifice one HP point in order to max out Speed, reducing Totodile's survivability. Additionally, an Adamant nature doesn't help you score any more valuable KOs on Pokémon such as Bronzor than Jolly does. Life Orb is the item of choice, as it provides Totodile the power to score most of the above OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Like most sweepers, Totodile greatly benefits from Stealth Rock and dual screen support. Stealth Rock helps Totodile score an OHKO on defensive Gligar, who would otherwise never be OHKOed. Dual screens allow Totodile to set up easier and help it take hits more easily. Type-wise, Bronzor and Pineco are the best options, as Totodile can switch in on the Fire-type attacks they attract. Encore support also makes Totodile's job much easier. Choice Scarf Wynaut is the best at the job, as it outspeeds Pokémon such as Swords Dance Krabby and forces them to keep setting up until Wynaut leaves the battle. Totodile can then easily use Swords Dance as the opposing Pokémon switches out. Ledyba is another great option, as it can both use Encore and set up dual screens.</p>

<p>Croagunk and Mantyke are Totodile's mortal enemies. They can both switch in on Aqua Jet and KO Totodile. Croagunk can be stopped by Choice Scarf Gligar, who easily shrugs off Vacuum Wave and Sucker Punch. Gastly and Drifloon also work well, despite being weak to Sucker Punch, because Gastly can put Croagunk to sleep with Hypnosis, and Drifloon can set up Substitute, while Croagunk attempts to KO them with Sucker Punch. Mantyke can be easily stopped by Chinchou, as Chinchou resists everything Mantyke can throw at it, aside from the rare Hidden Power Grass. Chinchou can then proceed to OHKO Mantyke with Thunderbolt. Speaking of Chinchou, it is another Pokémon who causes Totodile trouble, as it resists Aqua Jet and has Thunderbolt to subdue to it. Choice Scarf Gligar can switch in on Thunderbolt and Earthquake Chinchou, but will have trouble if Chinchou uses Agility. Munchlax can handle most of Chinchou's attacks, and hit back hard with Earthquake. Staryu is also a pain, as it is faster and has Thunderbolt. Elekid and Choice Scarf Magnemite can handle Staryu as well, and other Water-types.</p>

[SET]
name: Flail
move 1: Flail
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Aqua Jet
move 4: Substitute
item: Salac Berry / Liechi Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set has ridiculous power behind it, but is a little more risky. With this set, you can easily activate Torrent, which raises Aqua Jet to an impressive 90 Base Power (including STAB), and with a Swords Dance under its belt, Totodile is hitting like a ton of bricks. Flail, though, is the magic of this set. Since Fail's Base Power increases as the user's HP decreases, Totodile can Substitute down to one HP, making Flail reach a ridiculous 200 Base Power. Combine that with a Swords Dance or two, and Totodile can rip teams to shreds. However, this set comes with a huge risk when using it. Snover is becoming very common, and hail absolutely ruins Flail. Also, faster priority users, such as Elekid and Croagunk, can cause this set trouble. Despite these risks, this set can dish out heavy damage and is perfect for daring players, or players who just want to use something less common.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Salac Berry helps Totodile with its Speed issue. With a Speed boost, Totodile reaches 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Pokémon such as Life Orb Elekid and Houndour, and beat their priority moves with Aqua Jet. Liechi Berry can be used as a safe and surefire way to get an Attack boost, if you are unable to Swords Dance. Unlike the standard Swords Dance Totodile, this set can make good use of an Adamant nature. Since investing in HP is actually bad for this set, Totodile can fully focus on maximizing both its Speed and Attack, while still getting an extra point in Defense. With this spread, Totodile reaches 14 Speed, which becomes a nice 21 Speed after Salac Berry is activated.</p>

<p>This set is very vulnerable to priority and weather. Croagunk utterly destroys this set, so Choice Scarf Gligar and Drifloon make great team mates for Totodile. Without Salac Berry, this set is also weak to other priority users such as Elekid, Stunky, and Houndour. Diglett can trap all of these Pokémon, and hit them with a powerful super effective Earthquake, but must be wary of Sucker Punch. Weather is this set's biggest problem. Both hail and sandstorm ruin Flail, and thanks to Snow Warning and Sand Stream, they can be permanent. Due to this, a Rain Dance user such as Mantyke or Horsea is recommended, since it removes hail and sandstorm. Furthermore, rain boosts Aqua Jet's damage output even greater. Lastly, this set benefits from Stealth Rock and dual screen support.</p>

[SET]
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Waterfall / Aqua Tail
move 3: Return
move 4: Ice Punch / Crunch
item: Life Orb / Oran Berry
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 236 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sadly, Aqua Jet and Dragon Dance is an illegal move combination on Totodile. However, this doesn't stop Dragon Dance Totodile from threatening teams. On the other hand, while Dragon Dance Totodile is still a powerful threat, Totodile has some competition with Barboach for the team slot. Barboach is faster and has STAB Earthquake, but Totodile has access to Ice Punch, which makes it easier to take down Grass-types, as well as having higher Attack. Waterfall and Return provide perfect coverage with each other. However, Aqua Tail can be used if you like more power, but the trade off for lower accuracy and not being able to flinch is rarely worth it. Crunch can be used over Ice Punch to hit Ghost-types, such as Duskull, harder, but you have to question why you aren't using Corphish, as it does a better job at this. Life Orb is recommended for the item, since it allows Totodile to hit much harder after a single boost; however, Oran Berry can help you secure that boost and make sure you aren't going to be finished off by priority as easily.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You can choose between Jolly and Adamant nature, as both of them are effective. Jolly allows Totodile to outspeed Pokemon with 21 Speed using a Choice Scarf all over Little Cup. Adamant, on the other hand, gives Totodile an impressive 25 Attack to work with. The EVs are pretty standard. Maximium Attack and Speed mean Totodile will be sweeping at its maximum potential. The 4 EVs in Defense give it an extra point in the said stat.</p>

<p>Priority hurts this set more than the other two, since Totodile can't use Aqua Jet to beat them. Thankfully, Totodile is pure Water-type, and isn't weak to any priority. It can still hinder Totodile's sweeping ability, though. Diglett and Choice Scarf Gligar are great teammates, as they finish off Croagunk, Elekid, Stunky, and Houndour with ease. While both Diglett and Gligar are weak to Aqua Jet and Ice Shard, you have to remember one thing: Totodile resists these moves. Thus, Totodile shouldn't have much trouble taking down other users of these. Having Chinchou in the wings also never hurts, as it can take down Mantyke, who can cause some problems. Just like the previous two sets, Totodile loves having dual screens and Stealth Rock up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Totodile has a couple more physical options at its disposal. Aerial Ace can hit Croagunk and Grass-types; however, Grass-types are hit harder by Ice Punch. Superpower and Brick Break provide Totodile with the ability to take down Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types, but the Attack drop from Superpower is unfavorable. Brick Break is a decent substitute for Crunch or Ice Punch, though. It can also take down Reflect, which can hamper Totodile's sweeping potential. Rock Slide is a decent option, and it comes with a nice flinch rate. Lastly, Totodile does have Double-Edge, but Double-Edge has a nasty recoil, and is illegal with Aqua Jet.</p>

<p>Counter can score some surprise KOs, but is hardly worth a moveslot. Totodile also has access to some strong special moves, such as Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, but it doesn't have the Special Attack to abuse them effectively. Totodile can run a Choice set, but when you have access to the two best set up moves available to physical sweepers, forgoing  Totodile's sweeping potential is usually not the best option.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Croagunk and Mantyke are the two biggest pains in Totodile's rear. Aside from Dragon Dance Totodile, they both outspeed Totodile and heal HP from its Aqua Jet. Croagunk can the use Fake Out and Vacuum Wave in tandem to bring down Totodile, and Mantyke can utilize Hidden Power Electric to fry it into oblivion. Chinchou is also great, who can take hits thanks to its large HP and OHKO back with a faster Thunderbolt. Staryu works in the same way, except it has a little more trouble switching in due to its lower HP. Paras and Shroomish can switch in on Aqua Jet or Waterfall and put Totodile to sleep with Spore, but they must be careful of Ice Punch. Duskull can burn Totodile with Will-O-Wisp, but Crunch utterly destroys it. Faster priority users can revenge kill Totodile with ease. Stunky, Taillow, and Dratini, are all good examples.</p>

<p>Dragon Dance Totodile can be tough to take down if you let it set up. Choice Scarf Chinchou and Choice Scarf Elekid can stop it if it has only one Dragon Dance under its belt, but will have trouble if Totodile manages to get two. Dragon Dance Totodile does have one huge weakness, which can be easily taken advantage of: lack of priority. Croagunk and Duskull can work together to bring down Totodile. When Totodile is going to use Waterfall, switch to Croagunk. If Totodile uses Return, switch in Duskull. You can repeat this until you take down Totodile with Fake Out, Vacuum Wave, and Shadow Sneak. However, your opponent may catch on to this strategy, so be careful not to mispredict. Other than that, high power priority, such as a Choice Band-boosted Stunky's Sucker Punch or Doduo's Quick Attack can weaken Totodile greatly.</p>
