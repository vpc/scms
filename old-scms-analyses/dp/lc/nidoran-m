[Overview]

<p>Although Nidoran-M may have very mediocre stats, they are just good enough to let it function at an acceptable level. Nidoran-M does not have the most impressive defensive stats in Little Cup, so it should always be focusing on offense rather than defense. Poison is also a poor offensive type, meaning Nidoran-M doesn’t get a good STAB move to reliably hurt the opponent. Access to Sucker Punch, one of the strongest priority attacks in the game, is a blessing for Nidoran-M, but sadly it isn't very powerful due to Nidoran-M’s disappointing Attack stat. Despite its unsatisfactory stats overall, Nidoran-M has access to Rivalry, which gives it an Attack boost when it's against male Pokemon, and a fair movepool that prevents it from being completely outclassed by other Pokemon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Nidoran-M makes a decent mixed attacker with its respectable coverage. Sludge Bomb is Nidoran-M’s main STAB move that is capable of dealing deadly damage to any Pokemon not immune or resistant to it. Sucker Punch allows Nidoran-M to pick off weakened and faster foes. Ice Beam destroys Flying-, Ground-, and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Gligar and Dratini, though keep in mind that Nidoran-M cannot reliably outspeed these two threats. Hidden Power Fire hits Bronzor and other Steel-type Pokemon that would otherwise wall this set. Thunderbolt can also be used over Hidden Power Fire to hit Mantyke hard while still retaining neutral coverage on Steel-types, but has little utility outside of this.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb allows Nidoran-M to dish out as much damage as possible. The IVs minimize recoil damage, while still giving a 70 Base Power Hidden Power Fire. Rivalry further boosts Nidoran-M's power against male Pokemon, but Poison Point may be used instead if Rivalry seems too unreliable for you, as it does reduce damage done to female Pokemon. A Rash nature allows Nidoran-M to hit its hardest with its special attacks, but Naive is an option if Speed is more important, allowing Nidoran-M to outspeed all Pokemon with 14 Speed and below.<p>

<p>Nidoran-M greatly benefits from the removal of Munchlax, because even Double Kick will only 3HKO when factoring in Oran Berry. Therefore, Choice Scarf Mankey makes a great teammate to Nidoran-M, as it is able to easily OHKO Munchlax with Close Combat, as well as scout the opposing team with U-turn. Nidoran-M also appreciates entry hazards support to weaken the more defensive Pokemon on the opposing team. Bronzor is a good choice for setting up Stealth Rock because it resists Nidoran-M’s weaknesses, and can also set up dual screens to further support Nidoran-M. Gligar, a threat to Nidoran-M, is also checked well by Bronzor.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Poison Jab
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Double Kick
move 4: Return
item: Life Orb
ability: Rivalry
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 220 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 196 Spe
ivs: 0 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Nidoran-M’s higher Attack stat to hurt the opponent. Poison Jab is Nidoran-M's only reliable physical STAB attack, and is often its most powerful option against opposing Pokemon. With Sucker Punch, Nidoran-M can take out faster foes such as Abra and Gastly. Double Kick hurts Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon who take little damage from the rest of Nidoran-M's attacks. Lastly, Return rounds off Nidoran-M's coverage by damaging opponents who take neutral damage from Sucker Punch and Double Kick and resist Poison Jab.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Akin to the previous set, Life Orb is used to boost Nidoran-M’s power, while Rivalry increases Nidoran-M's damage output against male Pokemon. Jolly is the preferred nature to outpace more threats, such as common Pokemon who sit at 14 Speed, but if more power is desired, then an Adamant nature can be used. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed while allowing Nidoran-M to take both physical and special attacks a little better.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>All of Nidoran-M’s noteworthy moves have already been mentioned, but a lead set with Toxic Spikes, Super Fang, Poison Jab, and Counter could work; it's just that Croagunk and Stunky's abundance in Little Cup make Toxic Spikes not very useful. Rock Smash can be used over Double Kick to have a 50% chance of lowering the foe's Defense stat, allowing Nidoran-M to take it out easier, but its Base Power is thoroughly underwhelming.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Munchlax and Gligar can easily come in on any attack, except Ice Beam for Gligar, and OHKO Nidoran-M with Earthquake. If Nidoran-M is running the physical set, Gligar can even set up a Swords Dance before wreaking havoc. Due to Nidoran-M's frail defenses, it is not very hard to pick it off with priority moves if it has taken some prior damage. Bronzor can wall every set Nidoran-M can run due to its defensive stats and typing and then strike back with Psychic. Any Pokemon who has reasonable defensive stats will fare well against Nidoran-M because it doesn't hit very hard, and its poor defenses mean that it usually won't be able to take more than two hits.</p>
