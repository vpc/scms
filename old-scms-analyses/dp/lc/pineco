[Overview]

<p>Although it faces stiff competition from the likes of Sandshrew, Omanyte, and Anorith for a team slot, Pineco has a few unique qualities that set it apart from them. With good defenses and access to Rapid Spin, Pineco can usually find time to spin away harmful entry hazards that your team may hate. Additionally, Pineco can easily assist your team with all three entry hazards in hand. Pineco also has resistances to Fighting and Ground, as well as access to Explosion, which allows it to go out with a bang after it has done its job. Although Pineco might seem outclassed at first glance, it has its niche in the LC metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The main function of this set is to support the team using Pineco's entry hazards while acting as a physical tank in combination with Pineco's high Defense stat. Generally the most successful strategy is to switch Pineco into a resisted attack, such as a Choice-locked Earthquake, and spin away the opponent's entry hazards or set up its own. The moves on this set are quite simple. Spikes is the primary choice for entry hazards, because fewer Pokemon have access to it, but Stealth Rock can also be used if it benefits your team more. Rapid Spin is a valuable weapon in Pineco's arsenal, allowing your Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Mantyke and Houndour, to switch in without losing one-quarter (or more) of their health. Bug Bite eats Oran Berries commonly seen on defensive Pokémon, such as Munchlax and Bronzor, which allows Pineco to restore its HP and continue its job. The last moveslot is a matter of personal preference. Payback is the recommended attack in order to prevent Gastly and other Ghost-types from endlessly walling Pineco. Protect can be used to scout your opponent's attacks—namely Trick and Choiced attacks—and potentially rack up another turn of sandstorm or hail damage. Oran Berry is the recommended item for this moveset to increase Pineco's longevity. The EVs, in conjunction with an Impish nature, maximize Pineco's physical bulk, with the rest thrown into Attack for an extra bite behind Pineco's attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pineco does not need to invest much in its Attack stat simply because its goal isn't to deal direct damage to the other team. Instead, it attempts to passively weaken the opponent with residual damage from Spikes, Stealth Rock, or sandstorm/hail damage in conjunction with Protect. Toxic Spikes can be used with Protect on this set, which allows it to stall and rack up residual poison damage. This puts an effective timer on sweepers that use set-up moves, such as Totodile and Chinchou.</p>

<p>Good teammates for this set include Pokemon that have high Speed and enjoy having entry hazards weakening the opponent. For example, Choice Scarf sweepers such as Machop, Mankey, and Wailmer all enjoy having weakened opponents. Also, set-up Pokémon, such as Totodile and Chinchou, enjoy having entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field to turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set's purpose is solely to set up Stealth Rock and multiple layers of Spikes, then fire off a life-threatening Explosion. This moveset utilizes two forms of entry hazards, Stealth Rock and Spikes, in order to rack up as much passive damage as possible on the enemy team. Bug Bite can net Pineco extra healing outside of its own Oran Berry, as well as stripping its opponents of theirs. This moveset can be considered to be Pineco's trademark, since Pineco is the only Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame with access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Explosion together. Oran Berry is essential to increase Pineco's staying power, so it can set up as many entry hazards as possible. The EVs, in conjunction with an Impish nature, maximize Pineco's physical bulk, while the extra point in Attack increases the power of Pineco's Explosion.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Good teammates for this set are Pokemon that enjoy having weakened opponents, due to entry hazards turning 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs. A good example of this would be Carvanha. Carvanha can sponge a Fire-type attack aimed at Pineco, and with its deadly attacking capabilities, inflict a lot of damage to a weakened team. In addition, with three layers of Spikes, a Naughty Carvanha has a 33% chance to OHKO standard Munchlax with Crunch, with that number increased to 83% with Stealth Rock also in play. Also, pseudo-hazers make great partners to this set; unfortunately, Pokemon with Roar and Whirlwind are uncommon in Little Cup.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There aren't many options outside of the ones above for this little bagworm. Pain Split may look appealing, but it sees no main use outside of possibly beating Munchlax. Earthquake is a decent option, but Pineco is now a sitting duck in the face of Gastly. Toxic Spikes can be used over Spikes, but with many grounded Poison-types common in the Little Cup metagame, such as Croagunk and Stunky, it isn't as effective as Spikes. Gravity is viable in lieu of Rapid Spin, enabling Pineco to hit Gastly with Earthquake, in addition to having Spikes hit more Pokemon. Explosion can also be used in the last slot on the first set in order to possibly remove a potential threat after Pineco has finished its job.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to the fact that Pineco is a supporter, it technically doesn't have counters. Houndour can switch into Pineco, only fearing an uncommon Earthquake, and dispatch it with a super effective Fire-type attack. Gastly and other Ghost-types can block Pineco's Rapid Spin. Pineco also struggles against Aron, which easily forces Pineco out with its 150 Base Power Head Smash attack. Aron can also can set up a Rock Polish on the switch and wreak havoc on an unprepared team. Pokemon with Taunt can also prove troublesome for Pineco, as they can take away Pineco's ability to set up entry hazards, which is Pineco's main function.</p>
