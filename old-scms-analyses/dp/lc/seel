[Overview]

<p>Seel is a rather balanced Pokemon, so it can potentially fill numerous roles in your team; however, it is often overshadowed by Pokemon with higher stats. With that said, it does have one unique perk that merits its usage: it is the only Pokemon in Little Cup that learns the combination of Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Fake Out. If you are going to use Seel, then do so only after looking at whether or not another Pokemon does the intended job better.</p>

[SET]
name: Priority Attacker
move 1: Fake Out
move 2: Aqua Jet
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Waterfall / Zen Headbutt
item: Life Orb / Oran Berry
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 Atk / 36 SpD / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Having a variety of different priority moves is an amazing niche for Seel. With Fake Out, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard, Seel is able to get two hits for the price of one without the opposing Pokemon being able to touch it. Ice Shard differentiates Seel from other Aqua Jet users, allowing it to deal with threats such as Croagunk and Paras, which would normally wall Pokemon that rely solely on Aqua Jet for priority.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs may seem wasteful, but with the given EVs, Seel is able to Speed tie with other priority move-using Pokemon in the 14 speed tier. An alternative EV spread of 236 Atk / 236 Def / 36 SpD, which is based more around bulk, is available and should be used if your team already has a way to deal with priority Croagunk and if Seel is not running Zen Headbutt. When using this set, keep in mind that Seel is in no way a priority sweeper, as it lacks the raw power that other priority sweepers have; it is instead only a revenge killer.</p>

<p>As a revenge killer, Seel needs to be able to come in more than once; residual damage from entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes will gradually add up to cause Seel's death. Therefore, Pineco makes a good partner due to its resistance to Grass-type attacks and access to Rapid Spin. Baltoy may be weak to Grass-type attacks, but it has an immunity to Electric-type attacks and, like Pineco, the ability to Rapid Spin. Lastly, Croagunk makes a good partner in crime. It resists Seel's weakness Grass-type attacks and can help Seel finish off weakened opponents, as it has reliable priority moves as well. Croagunk is also immune to Water-type attacks, and Seel has difficulty hurting Water-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Seel, as a result of its natural sturdiness, can also attempt to fill a supporting role. There are many Pokemon with better defenses, but there are few that can reliably use Encore. With Encore, Seel can open the way for a very dangerous sweep for Pokemon like Gastly (when Encoring a Grass-type move) or Chinchou (when Encoring an Electric-type move) by allowing them tocome in on a move that they are resistant or immune to.</p>

<p>Seel's other ability, Hydration, isn't as useful in the fast paced metagame of Little Cup. If used on a Rain Dance team, it may be able to fit the role of a support Pokemon. If you would like to use Seel in this way, a set comprising of Encore / Rain Dance / Substitute / Waterfall can be annoying to your opponent and has the appeal of being able to potentially shut down Lileep.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Seel finds it difficult to lay serious damage on other Water-type Pokemon. Due to its unique typing, Chinchou gets a special mention for being able to resist Seel's STAB attacks and threaten with its own. Pokemon that are immune to Water-type attacks, such as Paras and Mantyke, can come in and force Seel out. Paras, however, has to be wary of Ice Shard. That said, any Pokemon that takes little damage from Water-type attacks should stand a good chance of countering Seel, especially if it happens to be carrying a move Seel is weak to. As most Seel don't run Hydration, Duskull is also a decent counter due to its ability to take Seel's attacks fairly well and burn it with a crippling Will-O-Wisp. On that note, any Ghost carrying Will-O-Wisp can counter Seel decently thanks to the free entry given by a predicted Fake Out.</p>
