[Overview]

<p>With its excellent stat distribution and wide movepool, Porygon can serve a multitude of roles, such as a pseudo-wall/supporter, a cleaner, or even a straight-out sweeper. Although Porygon can perform these roles well, Pokemon such as Munchlax have made the metagame revolve around Fighting-type attacks, making it hard for Porygon to set up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Porygon with Choice Specs is nothing to scoff at. Its already-impressive Special Attack, combined with its superb bulk, allow it to easily deal with a variety of threats. Choice Scarf increases its mediocre Speed to the 21 threshold, allowing it to outpace all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. Trace enables it to switch into certain Pokemon's STAB moves for free, like those of Chinchou, Mantyke, and Houndour. From there, Porygon can either immediately threaten with any of its three attacks; Shadow Ball is usually a safe bet to hit the incoming Ghost and KO it easily. From there, Tri Attack and Shadow Ball will 2HKO anything that does not resist it, allowing Porygon to deal with virtually any threat. Porygon is also unique in that it can very easily cripple Wynaut by tricking it a Choice item and then switching out, as Trace allows it to copy Shadow Tag.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Porygon does not need Speed when running Choice Specs, mainly due to its tremendous damage output and above-average bulk. It can easily revenge kill most Choice Scarf Pokemon, even ones that are at full health, as well as significantly dent most Pokemon that can't respond with Fighting-type moves. If running Choice Scarf, then it is required that one use a Timid nature and an EV spread of 76 HP / 236 SpA / 196 Spe. However, in this capacity Porygon serves as more of a revenge killer than a bulky attacker. Porygon can still utilise Trick to cripple incoming walls, however.</p>

<p>Porygon's best bets for teammates are Ghost-types and Pokemon who resist Fighting-type moves. Drifloon enjoys the free switch into a Choiced Fighting-type attack which allows it to set up a free Substitute. Gligar does likewise, boosting its stats safely once its Substitute is up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of Porygon's most dangerous sets, Agility rectifies Porygon's only subpar stat: Speed. With a Modest nature and 196 Speed EVs, Porygon hits 13 Speed and 19 Special Attack, enough to outspeed most of the notable Scarfers in the metagame after an Agility boost. Mankey and Houndour cap at 25 and Machop caps at 21. The only Choice Scarf Pokemon that are faster than this are Gligar and Diglett, both of whom are typically used in other ways. Gastly can also outspeed with a Choice Scarf; though formerly its most common set, Scarf Gastly has become rare as of late, so it isn't a particularly noteworthy threat to this Porygon variant.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Only Magnemite resists every move on this set, though it will not particularly enjoy getting hit repeatedly by any given move due to its poor Special Defense and abysmal HP stats. If Magnemite presents itself as a problem, Porygon can use Hidden Power Ground to deal with it more easily. Magby and Croagunk, both commonly-used revenge killers, are beaten easily by Hidden Power Ground as well. Hidden Power Ground also offers almost unresisted coverage (barring the Normal/Flying-types) when combined with Shadow Ball, while Tri Attack hits everything quite hard. Munchlax gives this set trouble as well, being the token special wall and able to hit back with a powerful Return.</p>

<p>A powerful physical attacker complements this Porygon well. Fighting-types in particular are especially effective teammates thanks to their super effective STAB moves to hit Munchlax and Magnemite with. Machop, with its superb bulk, is able to come in and immediately force out or kill either aforementioned defensive threat. Mankey can also serve this role well, as Choice Scarf Mankey can either U-turn away from a possible switch-in or do massive damage with Close Combat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Porygon is also among the most effective users of Trick Room. With its good stats and movepool, Porygon can begin attacking as soon as it has set up Trick Room, underspeeding all but the slowest Pokemon in the metagame. Porygon is able to support the team from an offensive standpoint effectively with its excellent type coverage, and if it opts for Recover, it can even set up Trick Room several times, a quality that nearly no other Trick Room user can boast.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Trick Room is obviously the focus of the set, as otherwise Porygon is just a slow attacker. It also serves as an excellent support move, letting other slow teammates manage a sweep. Tri Attack again is the staple offensive move of the set, letting Porygon walk all over Pokemon with poor Special Defense. Thunderbolt allows Porygon to handle Water-types with ease, while Shadow Ball lets it beat Ghosts. Alternatively, the aforementioned Recover can be used to help Porygon set up Trick Room more than once.</p>

<p>Trick Room Porygon does best with Trick Room-abusing teammates, such as Cubone or Krabby. They both benefit greatly from Trick Room and are able to easily remove from play Munchlax and Magnemite, two Pokemon that Porygon hates to face. Cubone's powerful STAB Earthquake coming off of a Thick Club-boosted Attack stat is nothing short of phenomenal, while Krabby's Crabhammer hits extremely hard as well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a variation on the above, mainly used when your team has enough Trick Room support. By running Return over Tri Attack, Porygon is able to 2HKO Munchlax without a Download boost. Porygon is then able to plow through other threats with the classic BoltBeam combination and its sky-high Special Attack stat. The equally-revered Fighting/Ghost combination is also usable, albeit with a good deal less Base Power in exchange for totally unresisted coverage. If another coverage attack does not appeal to you, you can use Trick Room so that Porygon can start its own party.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Porygon is stopped by very few Pokemon. Magnemite resists every move on the set barring Hidden Power Fighting or Hidden Power Ground, and without a Special Attack boost from Download, Porygon lacks the proper "oomph" to deal with it quickly, which is extremely detrimental to its sweep.</p>

<p>Mixed Trick Room Porygon's best teammates are Pokemon that can set up Trick Room and deal with the pesky Magnemite. Unfortunately, such Pokemon are limited in number. Bronzor is good for setting up Trick Room and can carry Earthquake to deal with Magnemite, though it can get into big trouble if Magnemite uses Magnet Rise, as Bronzor will be unable to switch out, thus wasting precious turns of Trick Room. Slow Fighting-types such as Machop and Makuhita make mincemeat out of Magnemite and Munchlax; slow Ground-types such as Cubone and Trapinch work just as well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Porygon can make use of its secondary trait, Download, only rarely. This is because, due to its genderlessness, it cannot have its level-up moves because Download is a Gen 4 Ability while the Pomeg Glitch is Gen 3 only. Magic Coat can be of use against Paras, which is certain to use Spore against Porygon. If you want to go for a status move, Porygon can use Discharge or even Thunder Wave to cripple opposing Pokemon. Porygon also has access to Rain Dance, Thunder, and the aforementioned Recover, allowing it to set it up again and again. It can also set up sun and use SolarBeam and Hidden Power Fire. On a hail team, Porygon's good defenses combined with access to Recover, Blizzard, and Hail makes it an excellent choice.</p>

<p>Porygon can also use Gravity in conjunction with its secondary trait, Download, along with 100% accurate Blizzard and Thunder, both of which are of equal Base Power to STAB Tri Attack (albeit with better coverage). It can also use Swift alongside Download, which can become stronger than Tri Attack if Porygon nets itself a Special Attack boost. Porygon's EVs vary greatly from set to set. On Agility sets, maximum Speed is necessary to hit any notable Speed value at all. Whether you max Special Attack or HP depends on whether or not you plan to be boosting your Porygon's Special Attack. For Trick Room sets, the EVs normally used for Speed can instead be allotted to Attack or HP, allowing Porygon to go mixed to beat Munchlax or to generally take more hits.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Porygon, despite its excellent attacking prowess, has a number of Pokemon that give it a bit of trouble. Magnemite stops Porygon cold if it doesn’t have a super effective Hidden Power. Munchlax stops non-mixed Porygon with its mammoth HP and Special Defense stats. Scarf Gastly can easily switch in on Tri Attack and hammer Porygon with a STAB Sludge Bomb, outpacing Modest Agility variants if Gastly itself is Timid. Croagunk's Vacuum Wave is a 2HKO, as is Magby's Mach Punch, both doing roughly 70% damage to Porygon. Barring the use of Hidden Power Ground, Porygon cannot OHKO either, allowing them to easily revenge kill it. Houndour's Sucker Punch also works in a similar vein, though it is technically possible to stall it out of Sucker Punch PP and then kill it with Tri Attack.</p>
