[Overview]

<p>Remoraid is a tremendous offensive threat thanks to its phenomenal movepool and good offensive stats. It also has pretty decent Speed, allowing it to become a deadly Choice Scarf user. Although Remoraid suffers from paper-thin defenses and lacks a priority move, its overall offensive prowess makes up for it. All in all, Remoraid could fit on teams that require great offensive pressure on the opponent.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Remoraid is quite lucky because it's one of the few Pokemon who learn Water Spout&mdash;the strongest Water-type move in Little Cup at full health bar. Choice Scarf Remoraid Speed ties with other prominent Choice Scarf users who linger at the 25 Speed mark, such as Houndour and Mankey. Remoraid is often compared to its fellow Water Spout user Wailmer, who has more HP. However, Wailmer does not reach 25 Speed with a Choice Scarf boost, making Remoraid a great alternative if you want that extra Speed. In the remaining slots, Surf serves as a reliable STAB attack, Ice Beam strikes Grass-types, and Hidden Power provides coverage. Hidden Power Ground hits Chinchou and Croagunk, while Hidden Power Grass hits opposing Water-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Water Spout is Remoraid's primary attack, as it hurts everything in Little Cup that isn't resistant or immune to it; when Remoraid is at full health, it has a whopping 150 Base Power. However, the Base Power of Water Spout depends on the percentage of Remoraid's HP remaining. Any form of damage, such as Stealth Rock, will weaken the power of Water Spout. As such, it's best to use Remoraid in the lead slot or bring it out early to keep its HP in mint condition.</p>

<p>Surf acts as an emergency STAB attack in case Remoraid fails to keep its HP intact. Ice Beam hits Grass-types, such as Paras, for super effective damage and Croagunk, who would otherwise wall this set, for neutral damage. The choice for the final slot depends on what your team needs Remoraid to hit. Hidden Power Ground smashes Croagunk and Chinchou, who may attempt to come in on your STAB attack. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass hits Wooper and opposing bulky Water-types for super effective damage.</p>

<p>Remoraid, even if it has taken Stealth Rock damage, can 2HKO Munchlax with Stealth Rock down, dealing a maximum of 54.55% with Water Spout. As such, Gastly makes an excellent partner; Remoraid can potentially lure in and KO Munchlax, giving Gastly more freedom to sweep late-game. Elekid also functions as a great late-game cleaner once your opponent's team is significantly weakened. Defensively, a two-man core of Gligar and Munchlax, makes a good addition alongside Remoraid. Croagunk and Mantyke are common Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks; Gligar can check Croagunk to a good degree, while Munchlax can 2HKO Mantyke with Returns. Rain Dance teams work well with Remoraid, as Rain Dance negates possible hail and sandstorm damage, which strip Remoraid of its precious HP. Rain Dance also boosts Water Spout's damage output, making Remoraid even more destructive.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Remoraid has a great physical movepool, a respectable Attack stat, and the ability Hustle, which boosts its Attack by 50%. Take note that Hustle's side effect reduces Remoraid’s accuracy by 20%, which means that normally 100% accurate moves are now 80% accurate. With Choice Band and Hustle, and Remoraid's Attack climbs to an outstanding 36, which is equivalent to Choice Band Cranidos’s. With the right support, Remoraid makes an excellent physical sweeper, despite its lack of priority moves. Waterfall hits any Pokemon who doesn’t resist it incredibly hard anything, Seed Bomb hits opposing Water-types, Return smacks Water Absorbers for neutral damage, and Water Spout bluffs a specially-based set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A boosted Waterfall is incredibly hard to switch into, because something is bound to lose a sizable chunk of its HP if your opponent is not packing a Water Absorber. Seed Bomb complements Waterfall, as it hits Water-types for super effective damage. Return rounds off the coverage, smashing Croagunk and Paras trying to gain HP with Dry Skin. The last slot depends on what item Remoraid is running. Water Spout works well with Choice Band or Choice Scarf, as it helps bluff a specially-based set. This attracts special walls like Munchlax the next time around, allowing Remoraid to OHKO them with Waterfall. If Remoraid is running Life Orb, Substitute is the preferred choice in order to block priority hits that would otherwise spell doom for Remoraid, due to its paper-thin defenses.</p>

<p>There are plenty of options to choose from for the item slot, depending on what your team needs. Choice Band provides instant power to hurt almost anything on the switch. Choice Scarf boosts Remoraid's Speed, while still letting it hit hard with 24 Attack, thanks to Hustle. Lastly, Life Orb adds more freedom, but doesn’t let Remoraid hit as hard as it would with Choice Band.</p>

<p>Remoraid doesn't really have any sure-fire counters; your best bet is to try to eliminate things that hinder its sweep, such as priority users and Water Absorb Pokemon. Priority moves plague the Little Cup metagame, so it’s generally hard to eliminate every priority user. Meowth, Croagunk, and Dratini, are common priority users; as such, defensive Gligar will work great alongside Remoraid to check these threats. In addition to this, Gligar also has Stealth Rock to help Remoraid sweep. Water Absorbers, like Mantyke, Croagunk, and Paras, will usually slow down Remoraid's sweep for the most part, because they prevent it from using its primary STAB move. As with the first set, Munchlax and Gligar can wall these Pokemon nicely, so be sure to pack them.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Choice Scarf
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Water Spout
move 3: Seed Bomb
move 4: Fire Blast
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Hustle
nature: Naughty
evs: 236 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Remoraid can run a mixed set effectively because of its ability, Hustle. With the suggested EV spread, Remoraid reaches 21 Attack, 16 Special Attack, and 24 Speed - enough to deal a respectable amount of damage on both ends. This set has excellent coverage, thanks to Water Spout, Fire Blast and Seed Bomb, and can be an effective sweeper late-game. Waterfall is the crux of the set, as it smashes unprepared Munchlax, and other special walls that may be lured in by Remoraid's special attacks. </p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Waterfall is Remoraid's main physical STAB move, while Water Spout is Remoraid's main special STAB move. Water Spout is excellent early in the game, when Remoraid's HP is in mint condition. The final two move slots provide great coverage along with its STAB moves. Seed Bomb allows Remoraid to hit Water-types for super effective damage, while Fire Blast hits Grass-types and Croagunk who attempt to absorb Remoraid's Water-type moves. However, if Dragon-types, such as Dratini, are more important, Ice Beam is another option.</p>

<p>Bringing a defensive Gligar alongside Remoraid can help check many priority moves directed at Remoraid's poor Defense stat. Gligar can provide Stealth Rock as well, helping Remoraid sweep more efficiently. Munchlax can deal with a portion of the Water Absorbers, who can switch in freely on Remoraid's main moves. Offensively, Elekid works great as a late-game sweeper once the opponent's team has taken a great deal of damage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Remoraid's offensive movepool is incredibly broad, so it has many options. Flamethrower is a good option over any set that is using Fire Blast to provide more accuracy. Gunk Shot could provide a way to hit Grass-types, as it packs 120 Base Power, but is very inaccurate. Psychic is another option to OHKO Croagunk. Charge Beam can also work in order to boost Remoraid's Special Attack.</p>

<p>Support-wise, Remoraid has Thunder Wave in its arsenal to cripple faster threats on the switch. This way, Remoraid can hold Life Orb instead of Choice Scarf to provide more flexibility. Lock On is also an interesting option in conjunction with Hustle to provide 100% accuracy on Remoraid's next hit.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There really aren't any specific counters to Remoraid, but there are several checks to it. First and foremost, Water Absorbers, such as Paras, Mantyke, and Croagunk, can slow it down. Priority users, such as Dratini and Meowth, can OHKO Remoraid most of the time with Stealth Rock down. For the Special Scarf set, Munchlax can check it for the most part if it hasn’t taken too much damage.</p>
