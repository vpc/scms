[Overview]

<p>Kricketot sports a massive movepool totaling 8 whole moves. That's good for a Bug-type Pokemon, being better than Weedle and Caterpie put together. If you intend on using a Bug-type in LC, make it Kricketot, because even though it can be taken out by a gentle breeze, it can actually deal damage successfully, something other Bug-types cannot boast. I'm looking at you, Weedle and Caterpie....</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>This set, in all honesty, is the best that Kricketot gets. The basic strategy is to use String Shot on the opposing Pokemon as it attacks and brings Kricketot down to its Focus Sash. Kricketot can now outspeed—or Speed tie if the Pokemon has 19 or 20 Speed—and bring the opposing Pokemon down to 1 HP with Endeavor. Bug Bite provides not very effective coverage against Ghost-type Pokemon, namely Gastly and Duskull, and will steal their Oran Berries (should they carry one). Growl rounds off the set, allowing Kricketot to lower the Attack of any Pokemon. This can be used in conjunction with String Shot to effectively give the opponent a reverse Dragon Dance, which can be useful due to the offensive nature of the Little Cup tier.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The EVs are simple: Kricketot's Attack and Speed stats are maxed, with a Jolly nature to ensure maximum Speed. Maximum Attack means that Bug Bite will pack a punch while also stealing Oran Berries. The remaining EVs are used to increase Kricketot's Defense stat by one point, allowing it to stomach certain physical hits.</p>

<p>Ghost-type Pokemon are a big problem for Kricketot, as they are immune to Endeavor, ruining its glorious strategy. However, it's not all doom and gloom. Kricketot can lower the Speed stats of the incoming Ghost-types with String Shot, then switch into a Dark-type Pokemon such as Stunky or Houndour, allowing them to easily trap and kill the helpless Ghost-type with Pursuit. This strategy can be very effective, making Stunky and Houndour great assets to Kricketot. Dual screens support from a defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor is recommended if Kricketot intends to imploy the "Reverse Dragon Dance" strategy. An alternative EV spread of 236 HP / 36 Def / 236 SpD is also encouraged when using this strategy. Rapid Spin support from the likes of Tentacool or Pineco can be very helpful for Kricketot, meaning it can switch in safely without breaking its Focus Sash.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Bide is optional; however, Kricketot will need a heavily defensive EV spread to pull this off, as well as dual screen support. Mud Slap can be used in the place of Growl, but that means that Kricketot will be unable to perform the "Reverse Dragon Dance" strategy. Snore is handy if your team needs a sleep absorber, as it allows Kricketot to dish out damage even in its sleep. Lastly, Uproar can be used in a similar manner to Salamence's Outrage, devastating everything in its path. However, Kricketot can be used as setup bait for Ghost-type Pokemon should this be the case. For this reason, it might be best to avoid the tremendous power that Uproar brings to the table.</p>
