[Overview]

<p>Lileep is a curious Pokemon in the Little Cup tier; in order to fully use its sweeping potential, you need to pair it with a certain Pokemon. The main component to any Lileep team is Hippopotas due to its ability to activate sandstorm, which raises Lileep's average Special Defense stat to one of the highest in the metagame. You also need a team that can soften up and remove problematic counters for Lileep so that it can safely stat up. Combine this with a decent HP stat, a strong Defense stat, a movepool that complements its natural bulk, and a helpful ability in Suction Cups, and you get a Pokemon that has the potential to sweep through unprepared teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is one of the most despised sets in Little Cup for its ability to turn a "won" match into a quick loss. This set is simple and fairly easy to set up; however, it will require permanent sandstorm to be in effect. Switch Lileep in near the end of a match, when most Pokemon are weakened, and begin to Stockpile up. With the bulky EV spread, Lileep reaches 26 HP, 18 Def, and 24 SpD under sandstorm conditions, even before any boosts. Stockpile and Recover as necessary to maintain maximum health (also remember that you have an Oran Berry, which is basically like a free Recover). All the while sandstorm should be whittling down the opposing Pokemon's health. In the end you are aiming to get 3 Stockpiles and at least one Swords Dance in before you starting attacking.</p>

<p>Often you will find that unless the opposing Pokemon either has STAB Ice-, Fighting-, or Bug-type attacks, they aren't going to bring Lileep down. Their only hope is a lucky critical hit. After sufficient setup, sweep with Seed Bomb, which will be coming from 20 Attack after a Swords Dance. If you're feeling lucky, you can Swords Dance even more if you feel like you need the extra power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hippopotas is a required teammate in order for this set to function properly. Outside of that, there are a few key teammates that can make Lileep's life much easier. A Pokemon to take Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Machop and Mankey is highly advised. Slowpoke fits this bill nicely, and as a bonus, Slowpoke also eats any Ice-type attacks thrown at Lileep. In return, Lileep walks all over any users of Electric- and Grass-type attacks, and can easily tank most users of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks. If a teammate has spread poison around the opposing team through the use of Toxic and Toxic Spikes, the amount of time that it takes Lileep to wear out the opponents is greatly diminished. Omanyte is a fantastic teammate to set up Toxic Spikes, while defensive Gligar is a great choice to spread around Toxic. Finally, if Lileep is afflicted with Toxic or Toxic Spikes, it's basically turned into dead weight. Therefore, including a Poison-type such as Croagunk, or Rapid Spinner such as Pineco or Sandshrew on your team will prove to be greatly beneficial.</p>

[SET]
name: Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock

evs: 228 HP / 36 SpA / 220 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lileep makes a great lead due its ability to beat a lot of the common leads in Little Cup and its general bulk to take a lot of hits. Common leads in Little Cup include Kabuto, Omastar, Phanpy, Chimchar, Aipom, Meowth, and Houndour, many of whom Lileep can easily manage. Stealth Rock is a no-brainer move that is usually set up, barring Taunt leads like Aipom and Meowth. Energy Ball is a nice STAB move that hits Kabuto, Omastar, and Phanpy for significant damage. Earth Power hits Chimchar and Houndour for super effective damage and breaks their Focus Sashes. AncientPower is a strong STAB move that hits Flying Pokemon like Mantyke for decent damage. The novelty in this set lies in the fact that nothing can really OHKO Lileep except for Snover's Blizzard. 228 HP and 220 Special Defense EVs allow it to survive an Overheat from Houndour and Chimchar with just enough health left to activate Oran Berry. The extra EVs are put into Special Attack to give Lileep a little extra power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Alternatively, Giga Drain can be used instead of Energy Ball for the ability to heal a little bit, though it sacrifices power; it still OHKOes Kabuto and Omastar, and takes a significant chunk from Phanpy. Hidden Power Rock is also another option that gives you 10 more Base Power than AncientPower. However, AncientPower's ability to boost all stats by one stage 10% of the time is usually more helpful than the power boost of Hidden Power Rock.</p>

<p>As Lileep can't beat Snover, a Pokemon to tank its Blizzard is a highly recommended teammate. Mantyke can easily tank Blizzard and threaten to maim it back with Hidden Power Flying. Lileep also cannot prevent other leads from setting up Stealth Rock, so packing a Rapid Spinner on your team, such as Pineco or Sandshrew, is crucial.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lileep has some other interesting options; Curse cuts down on setup time, but leaves Lileep more open to special attacks. However, the absence of Swords Dance frees up a slot for Lileep to run another attacking move, like Rock Slide, alongside Seed Bomb. Curse Lileep should run an EV spread of 228 HP / 220 SpD / 60 Def. Amnesia is another option which would allow you to get as many boosts as you wanted instead of the normal cap of three that Stockpile has. It is also possible to run a stall set that uses Toxic and Energy Ball instead of Swords Dance and Seed Bomb; however, you might as well set up Lileep if you can stall.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The number one counter to Lileep is Snover; not only does it stop sandstorm and eliminate the Special Defense boost, but it can also OHKO Lileep with a STAB Blizzard. You will want to get rid of it and have sand presence before you set up Lileep, otherwise it will switch in all day and make Lileep's life miserable.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Dratini and Bagon are fairly decent counters to Lileep because of their ability to Dragon Dance in the face of Lileep while taking minimal damage even from a Swords Dance-boosted Seed Bomb. Smart Dratini users will usually Dragon Dance up until they know Lileep is in KO range for Outrage, but often, many will panic and immediately attack, in which case Lileep can just Recover off most of the damage and then wear them down. Anything that can poison Lileep with Toxic is also a pretty effective counter. The good news is that Toxic is fairly rare in Little Cup, along with the use of Toxic Spikes, so this is usually a minor threat; it is still possible, however. Lastly, critical hits are the bane of Lileep's existence. It may sound silly, but often if a Lileep gets set up with 3 Stockpiles and a Swords Dance, that 6% chance is all it takes to render all Lileep's hard work for nought.</p>
