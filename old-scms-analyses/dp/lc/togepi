[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Togepi may seem to be terrible, but it has a few niches that allow it to avoid being severely outclassed. Although its stats are fairly terrible overall, it has decent defenses and a workable Special Attack. Its saving grace is its massive movepool. Togepi learns nearly every single support move there is. It can also use its nearly unique ability, Serene Grace, to great effect. While Togepi is certainly not a good Pokemon in Little Cup, it does have a few tricks up its sleeve.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best combination of Togepi's good bulk and massive movepool. Togepi is the bulkiest Pokemon in Little Cup besides Eevee to have the rare move Wish. Keep in mind that this set should only be used to take out walls, as most sweepers will either 2HKO Togepi or set up on it. Fire Blast is for Steel-types that are immune to Toxic, especially Bronzor (whom Togepi beats bar Bronzor carrying Toxic). As long as Togepi does not get hit by Toxic, it should be able to defeat most walls one-on-one.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature maximize Togepi's bulk. Serene Grace raises Fire Blast's burn chance to a nifty 20%, which can come in handy if you need a last-ditch attempt to stop a physical sweeper. Oran Berry gives Togepi a one-time instant recovery, and can allow Togepi to start the Wish / Protect cycle or land a Toxic.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes help Togepi a lot, as it allows it to take one less hit that it would have needed to take if it was using Toxic. Tentacool is a nice teammate, setting up Toxic Spikes and resisting the Fighting-type attacks often directed at Togepi. Croagunk can revenge kill sweepers that attempt to set up on Togepi, and also resists Fighting-type attacks. Ghost-types provide a nice Fighting-type immunity, and Choice Scarf Gastly can revenge kill sweepers that do not reach 27 Speed after their Speed boost. Since Gastly walls this set, being immune to Toxic and taking little from Fire Blast, a Pokemon such as Stunky or Munchlax to trap and kill Gastly is recommended.</p>

[SET]
name: ParaFlinch
move 1: Body Slam / Thunder Wave
move 2: Headbutt
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Softboiled / Zen Headbutt
item: Oran Berry
ability: Serene Grace
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As the only Pokemon in Little Cup to get Serene Grace, (aside from Happiny, who has terrible stats), Togepi can effectively abuse its ability despite its low Attack and Speed. Body Slam has a nice 60% chance of paralysis, but Thunder Wave always paralyzes (except against Ground-types) and can paralyze Ghost-types as well. Headbutt is Togepi's best way of flinching opponents, because if the opponent is paralyzed, Headbutt will have a 70% chance of causing the opposing Pokemon to do nothing. Fire Blast takes out Steel-types that would otherwise wall this set. Softboiled is Togepi's best form of recovery, and paralysis can give Togepi a free change to use it. Zen Headbutt, however, has a 40% flinch chance to hit Ghost-types with, and Gastly is hit super effectively. If Togepi uses Zen Headbutt, Thunder Wave is recommended so Togepi can achieve a Headbutt-like effect with Zen Headbutt.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature maximize Togepi's Attack while still making good use of Togepi's respectable bulk. At 8 Speed, Togepi outruns all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup after paralysis. Keep in mind that some Choice Scarfers will still outspeed Togepi. A nature that does not lower Special Attack, such as Naughty, can be used to power up Fire Blast, but it detracts from Togepi's decent bulk.</p>

<p>Despite carrying Fire Blast, Togepi still has a lot of trouble with Steel-types. Therefore, Fire- and Fighting-types are recommended to help take out Steel-types. Running a team around paralysis is also a good idea, as it removes the burden of taking a hit while paralyzing the opponent. If Togepi does not have Zen Headbutt, Pokemon such as Munchlax or Stunky are recommended to take out Ghost-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>As previously stated, Togepi has many viable moves. Togepi is one of very few Pokemon that gets Nasty Plot and Baton Pass, but is mostly outclassed by Aipom in that respect. It gets many special attacking moves; the most viable is probably Psychic to catch Fighting-types off guard, but Fire Blast is usually better. Heal Bell can remove status from Togepi's team. Counter can be used in conjunction with Focus Sash for surprise OHKOs on most Fighting-types. Keep in mind though that Machop will confuse Togepi with DynamicPunch. Yawn and Encore are options to make Togepi a lot less vulnerable to set-up sweepers. Finally, Magic Coat is a situational move that, if used properly, can reflect entry hazards or status moves back at your opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Fighting-types, such as Machop and Mankey, will easily OHKO Togepi with their STAB moves; they just have to watch out for a stray Psychic. The Toxic Stall set can be set up on by most Pokemon, especially if they carry Substitute to negate Toxic. Substitute Houndour with Flash Fire completely walls the set. While the ParaFlinch set is extremely annoying, switching out after paralysis will force Togepi to take another hit while using Body Slam or Thunder Wave again. Limber Buneary is immune to paralysis, and although it doesn't have the best bulk, it will easily take Togepi's weak attacks and KO it with STAB Return.</p>
