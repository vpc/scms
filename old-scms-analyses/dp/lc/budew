[Overview]

<p>When one looks at Budew, the first thing that comes to mind is how cute it is with its endearing sleepy eyes and adorable petite stature. But take one look at its stats, and that love quickly turns into disappointment. However, with great assets such as Spikes, Stun Spore, Leaf Storm, and Natural Cure, backed up by an efficient stat distribution, Budew can make quite a splash in Little Cup. Although it does suffer from frailty issues, Budew can be somewhat decent if it is backed up by good teammates and used correctly.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Budew is one of the select few Pokemon in Little Cup that can set up Spikes. Unlike some of the other Spikers in Little Cup, Budew possesses good typing and bulk, as well as decent Speed, which allows it to set up effectively. Budew's access to Natural Cure allows it to adopt a sort of Spike-and-run strategy; it does this by Spiking as much as it can, Resting off any damage, and then switching out, recovering from sleep automatically due to Natural Cure. However, Budew isn't limited solely to providing entry hazard support: it also has access to Stun Spore and sports resistances to common attacking types in Little Cup, such as Water and Fighting. Using these tools, Budew can easily spread paralysis throughout the opposing team and deal good damage with either of its STAB moves of choice.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Both Energy Ball and Sludge Bomb are viable options for the second moveslot. Energy Ball provides Budew with a reliable STAB move that possesses decent super effective coverage on the many Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types that inhabit Little Cup. Sludge Bomb, on the other hand, provides better neutral coverage and has higher Base Power. Stun Spore allows Budew to cripple its counters and either KO them with its STAB move of choice or switch to an appropriate counter. Sleep Powder may be tempting to include in the set in Stun Spore's place, but it is illegal in conjunction with Spikes. Rest is the icing on the cake; Rest paired with Natural Cure provides Budew with a reliable recovery move that restores all of its health with no real drawbacks besides the necessity of switching out.</p>

<p>This set can also work well as a lead. However, if Budew isn't in the lead position, then it can switch in and set up on a variety of Choiced Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mankey or Machop and Choice Band Remoraid. It can also set up on some variants of Chinchou that lack Ice Beam, as well as Croagunk that lack Ice Punch. Rest allows for a larger margin of error when using Budew, as you can fully heal Budew's health and switch out when it's badly hurt; however, Budew cannot endure attacks from hard-hitting Pokemon for long, so you must play cautiously in order to preserve it. Duskull makes for a great partner as it blocks Rapid Spin and is immune to Normal- and Ground-type assaults. It also deals with Gligar effectively, which would otherwise trouble Budew.</p>

<p>Budew's Stun Spore allows it to cripple the fast sweepers that it lures, such as Houndour, Ponyta, Gligar, and Diglett. Slow, hard-hitting Pokemon such as Aron and Omanyte enjoy having these Pokemon paralyzed, and therefore make effective partners. Water-type Pokemon like Chinchou also pair well with Budew as they provide an answer to Fire-types. Chinchou, thanks to its strong STAB Thunderbolt, also has the bonus of being able to deal with opposing Water-types that sport Ice Beam.</p>

<p>Although what is listed above is generally the most effective way to utilize Budew, there are a couple of other options. A Bold nature is advised on this set because it augments Budew's Defense stat, allowing Budew to switch in on physical Fighting-type moves more reliably; however, a Calm nature is a perfectly viable choice as it allows Budew to take special hits even better. Although Stun Spore is a great support move, it can be switched out for Sludge Bomb if you wish for Budew to have a reliable secondary STAB, Shadow Ball if you want Budew to be able to quickly deal with Ghost-types like Gastly, or Hidden Power Ice if you wish for Budew to deal with Gligar. An alternative EV spread of 196 HP / 36 SpA / 36 SpD / 236 Spe with a Calm or Bold nature can be used in lieu of the one above in order to capitalize on Budew's above-average Speed stat. Running 236 Speed EVs with a neutral nature gives Budew 15 Speed, allowing it to surpass the cluttered 14 Speed benchmark. If you wish to utilize Budew in the lead position, then this EV spread is usually a superior choice than the one displayed in the set.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Budew's Special Attack stat may seem low, its good Speed when Scarfed and access to the ridiculously strong 140 Base Power Leaf Storm allow it to function quite effectively as a Choice Scarf user. Thanks to its helpful resistances to Fighting- and Water-type attacks, Budew can find many opportunities to switch in and fire off full-powered Leaf Storms. Sleep Powder makes countering Budew even more difficult, as it lets Budew easily put one of its counters out of commission. Budew's access to Natural Cure helps it not only to remove status ailments, but also to fully recover its HP with Rest while waking up immediately after it switches out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Bulbasaur is Budew's main competition for a team slot when using this set, as it possesses one more point in Special Attack and access to Sleep Powder as well. The reasons to use Budew over Bulbasaur are simple: higher Speed and Natural Cure. Budew reaches 22 Speed with a Modest nature and 24 Speed with a Timid nature, which lets it outpace the coveted 21 Speed benchmark that many Scarfers aim for.</p>

<p>Budew's dual STABs in Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb form a potent combo and pack quite a punch, while Sleep Powder allows Budew to incapacitate both its counters and any Pokemon that pose a threat to the team. If a sleep-inducing move is unnecessary, then Rest can be utilized to abuse Natural Cure and prolong Budew's life span. Budew's dual STABs leave it vulnerable to Steel- and Poison-types. Hidden Power Fire is an option to hit Bronzor and Magnemite super effectively, as well as Dry Skin Croagunk for increased damage. Hidden Power Ground is another option that hits Poison-types like Grimer and Stunky harder; it also has the bonus of hitting Magnemite and Rock/Steel-types 4x super effectively. Shadow Ball provides good neutral coverage and hits Ghost-types like Gastly; however, it does leave Budew a bit more vulnerable to Magnemite and Stunky. Extrasensory is another option in the third slot, but it is generally inferior to the aforementioned options.</p>

<p>Running Budew with a Timid nature allows it to outrun 22 Speed Scarfers such as Adamant Eevee, Adamant Cranidos, positive-natured Bulbasaur, and positive-natured Krabby. Since many of these Pokemon are threatening, they are generally worth outrunning if you don't mind the drop in Budew's Special Attack. Running Shadow Ball allows Budew to run a more efficient EV spread of 36 HP / 196 SpA / 40 SpD / 236 Spe since it isn't losing any IVs for Hidden Power; the added bulk that this spread provides lets Budew switch in on a wider variety of attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Budew doesn't really have many other options besides the ones listed above. A Life Orb set with three attacks and Rest is an option, but Budew's frailty usually lets it down. Synthesis is an option over Rest on the Spikes set, but it is usually a bad idea since it only heals 25% of Budew's health in rain, which is fairly common in Little Cup. Although Budew also has access to Swords Dance, it lacks the Attack stat and the physical movepool to abuse it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Although Budew is easily countered, it is still fairly hard to switch into due to its access to Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. However, if you can avoid the potential status ailments, Fire-types like Ponyta and Houndour can easily take care of Budew with their STAB attacks, despite taking a hefty amount of damage from Sludge Bomb. Gligar with Aerial Ace also counters Budew easily.</p>

<p>Diglett is Budew's worst nightmare if it manages to switch in while Budew is using Rest. Due to its ability, Arena Trap, Diglett can prevent Budew from switching out, effectively making it a sitting duck. Munchlax doesn't mind paralysis and can easily tank most of Budew's attacks while KOing Budew with its STAB move of choice. Offensively oriented Water-types that pack Ice Beam also cause Budew trouble, but are hit super effectively by Budew's STAB and therefore are not notable threats. Strong Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Abra and friends utterly destroy Budew; however, most Psychic-type Pokemon abhor paralysis and are OHKOed or 2HKOed by either of Budew's STABs. Grimer and Croagunk resist both of Budew's STABs and can heavily damage it if they pack super effective coverage moves like Fire Punch and Ice Punch.</p>
