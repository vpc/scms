[Overview]

<p>Life can be tough for Ekans. It has two amazing abilities, Intimidate and Shed Skin, and a great physical movepool. However, it has fairly poor stats that hold it back from being truly amazing. Despite this, if played to its strengths, Ekans can be a decent Pokemon. Intimidate can make almost any physical sweeper think about switching out, and Glare can guarantee they are going to be punished if they stay in as well. Ekans can also hit hard with Choice Band, or act as a nice revenge killer with Choice Scarf. As a bonus, thanks to Intimidate and being Poison-type, Ekans can stop Choice Scarf Mankey and Machop in their tracks. Basically, play to these strengths, and Ekans can be an asset to any team.</p>

[SET]
name: Glare
move 1: Glare
move 2: Poison Jab / Gunk Shot
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Bite / Aqua Tail
item: Oran Berry
ability: Intimidate
nature: Adamant
evs: 76 HP / 196 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 156 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Intimidate and the paralysis-inducing move, Glare. Using this set is rather simple: Come in on a physical attacker to try and force a switch because of Intimidate, and use Glare on whatever comes in. Unlike Thunder Wave, Glare paralyzes any Pokemon, regardless of its type; however, Glare has a shaky 75% accuracy, which can prove fatal if you miss. Poison Jab and Gunk Shot are Ekans's two best STAB moves, the former being more accurate but less powerful.</p>

<p>Earthquake is used to hit Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types besides Bronzor for super effective damage. The last move is a choice between Bite and Aqua Tail. Bite can be used to hit Ghost-types and also has a chance to create the deadly paraflinch combination. Aqua Tail is used to hit Ground-types, the most notable being Gligar, who resists Ekans's STAB moves and is immune to Earthquake. It also hits Bronzor for more damage than Bite.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs Ekans invests in all have a specific purpose. The 76 HP EVs and 4 Defense EVs allow for 21 HP and 11 Defense, respectively. This allows Ekans to never be 3HKOed by Scarf Machop's DynamicPunch, making it a great switch in. 196 Attack EVs allow Ekans to reach max Attack with an Adamant nature. With 14 Speed, Ekans can outrun specific Pokemon, such as Phanpy, Duskull and Aron, and proceed to attack it if Glare misses on the switch. The 4 EVs in Special Defense add an extra stat point.

<p>This set loves having entry hazards up, since Intimidate often forces switches. Pineco is a great teammate because of this, since it can switch in on Ground-type moves and can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Omanyte can also set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, but it shares Ekans's Ground-type weakness, so Pineco is almost always the superior choice. However, with this set, be sure to not set up Toxic Spikes, as it gets in the way of Glare, since it prevents the foe from being paralyzed.</p>

<p>This set is not designed to obliterate the foe, but to cripple him, so it doesn't need much help offensively. This allows Ekans to be a great aid to sweepers, especially slow ones, thanks to its ability to paralyze opponents. Slowpoke, Stunky and Carvanha are both great examples of Pokemon who appreciate paralysis support. They can all switch in on Psychic-type moves easily and start sweeping without the fear of being slower than the opponent. Munchlax can also take advantage of paralysis support, and can do huge damage with it. Aron, especially the powerful Choice Band set, makes great use of paralysis support, as it makes up for its lackluster Speed. Defensively, you are probably going to want the same teammates as the Choice set. Bronzor and Houndour continue to be great and Bronzor also benefits from the paralysis support, due to its low Speed. Just be sure you aren't running Gyro Ball, since paralysis will lower its power.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Poison Jab / Gunk Shot
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Aqua Tail
move 4: Bite
item: Choice Band / Choice Scarf
ability: Intimidate
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 196 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With an acceptable movepool and decent Attack, Ekans can effectively use a Choice item. Both Choice items are completely viable, but they give Ekans very different play styles. Choice Band raises Ekans's Attack to high levels, while Choice Scarf gives it a useful boost in Speed and allows it to act as a revenge killer. What separates Ekans from most other Choice item users, though, is Intimidate. It's a rare ability in Little Cup, and while Ekans doesn't have the best Defense or HP, it helps the poisonous snake take physical hits better, especially DynamicPunch from Machop and Close Combat from Mankey.</p>

<p>Poison Jab is a reliable STAB move which packs decent power. Gunk Shot, on the other hand, hits 50% harder in return for 30% less accuracy. Ekans's Poison-type attacks are resisted by Rock-, Ghost-, Ground-, and other Poison-types, while Steel-types are completely immune to them. That's where Earthquake comes in; hitting Rock-, Poison- and Steel-types for super effective damage. It also scores super effective hits on common Pokemon such as Elekid and Houndour. Aqua Tail is used to hit Ground-types, such as Gligar and Hippopotas, for super effective damage. It also hits Bronzor, who is immune to the aforementioned attacks thanks to its Steel-typing and Levitate, for neutral damage. Bite is used to deal with Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Gastly and can also flinch opponents, which is an effect that can be beneficial to the Choice Scarf set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With Choice Band equipped, Ekans reaches 24 Attack with an Adamant nature, or 22 Attack with a Jolly nature. On the other hand, Ekans with Choice Scarf and Jolly nature reaches 24 Speed, making it very effective at revenge killing. The 4 EVs in Defense and Special Defense gives Ekans one point in each stat.</p>

<p>Ekans benefits greatly from Stealth Rock support. With Stealth Rock on the field, Adamant Choice Scarf Ekans can 2HKO most offensive Gligar with Aqua Tail. Choice Band Ekans can 2HKO the standard Slowpoke with Bite, and has a small chance of 2HKOing Bronzor with Aqua Tail. Like most other offensive Pokemon, Ekans also benefits greatly from having Reflect and Light Screen up. Thanks to Reflect and Intimidate, Ekans is, on average, only 5HKOed by Choice Scarf Mankey's Close Combat. This makes switching in extremely easy for it. Bronzor and Pineco are great teammates for Ekans, since they can both set up Stealth Rock and dual screens. It should also be noted that Bronzor resists both of Ekans weaknesses, making it an even better partner. Ledyba is also a decent dual screens user to team up with Ekans. Ledyba can switch in on Earthquake and use Encore, providing itself with ample time to set up screens.</p>

<p>Ekans isn't one of those Pokemon who can rush into battle and start sweeping. It needs a bit of support before it can begin to pose as a big threat. Bronzor is Ekans's bane, so Choice Specs Magnemite is an amazing teammate. It can trap Bronzor with Magnet Pull and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Even with Bite, Ghost-types like Duskull and Misdreavus are a pain for Ekans to deal with, especially if they are running Will-O-Wisp. This makes Houndour a great partner, since it can switch in on Will-O-Wisp and threaten Ghosts with Dark Pulse and Sucker Punch. Mantyke and Croagunk can also cause problems. Mantyke can switch in on Earthquake and Aqua Tail without any fear, and Croagunk resists Bite and Ekans's Poison-type moves. They can also restore HP by switching into Aqua Tail, due to Water Absorb and Dry Skin respectively. Chinchou is a great teammate since it can take down Mantyke with ease. Bronzor can bring down Croagunk with Psychic or Earthquake, which makes it an ideal partner. Defensively, Ekans also needs quite a bit of support. As with any Choice item user, Ekans will find itself switching often. Thus, having Pokémon who can switch in on moves commonly used to stop Ekans is a must. Bronzor and Houndour deserve mention again. Bronzor can switch in on Ground-type moves freely thanks to Levitate, and can shrug off any Psychic-type attack thrown at it. Houndour stops Will-O-Wisp and is immune to Psychic-type moves, but it must be wary of Earthquake. Baltoy is similar to Bronzor, since it also has Levitate and resists Psychic-type moves and can also use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, which can cause trouble since Ekans will be switching often.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ekans has a number of decent options outside of those listed. Seed Bomb hits Rock/Ground- and Rock/Water-types hard, and is a viable choice over either Earthquake or Aqua Tail. Rock Slide has great coverage with Earthquake, and is a viable replacement for Bite on the Choice sets. It also creates the often annoying paraflinch combination on the Glare set. Beat Up is moderately effective, but Ekans has neither the Speed nor the Attack to take full advantage of it. Pursuit is an option to hit fleeing opponents, and can be used as a substitute for Bite. Double-Edge is an option because it hits as hard as super effective Bite and STAB Poison Jab. It does, however, come with recoil damage, which can greatly lower Ekans's survivability.</p>

<p>Dark Pulse, Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain and Hidden Power allow Ekans to pull together a Choice Specs set, but with its low Special Attack, it's hardly worth it. Hidden Power Ice, however, can be used to hit Gligar for 4x super effective damage, which will inflict heavy damage regardless of investment.</p>

<p>Rest is an option to complement Ekans's second ability, Shed Skin, but it is unreliable and Ekans's defenses are rather shaky. Speaking of Shed Skin, it is also a decent substitute for Intimidate on the Choice set, since it can remove crippling status that would otherwise make Ekans useless, such as paralysis. Stockpile can be used to bolster Ekans's defenses, but is very gimmicky and not recommended.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>For the Choice set, prediction is the best counter. Gligar can switch in on Poison Jab, Gunk Shot, or Earthquake, and hit back with a powerful STAB Earthquake. Bronzor can do the same, and takes less damage from Aqua Tail. It can also hit with super effective STAB Psychics or Earthquake as well. Croagunk can take Poison Jab and Payback well, and restores HP from Aqua Tail. It can then proceed to hit it with Earthquake or Hidden Power Psychic.</p>

<p>The Glare set is tricky to switch into, because no Pokemon will like being paralyzed. If you have a Pokemon such as Taillow or Teddiursa who already is burned or poisoned, they can safely switch in on Glare and hit with STAB Facade for an OHKO. Glameow can switch in without fear thanks to Limber, and hit hard with Return. Other than that, your best bet is to hope Glare's shaky 75% accuracy causes it to miss.</p>

<p>If Ekans does manage to score a KO, there are plenty of effective revenge killers. Choice Scarf Gligar is great, since it resists the purple snake's STAB, outruns Choice Scarf Ekans and OHKOes with Earthquake. Choice Scarf Cranidos is also great, and it doesn't have to worry about Pokemon with Levitate switching in on Earthquake, thanks to Mold Breaker. Choice Scarf Abra can also work, since Psychic tears Ekans to pieces. Choice Scarf Diglett is the best at the job, however, since it can trap Ekans and OHKOes it with Earthquake.</p>
