[Overview]

<p>Cherubi is adorable; it's a shame that it was cursed with horrible stats and a movepool which is only fit for one purpose. Chlorophyll is probably the only reason to use Cherubi; when the sun is active, Cherubi becomes one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, and with its decent Special Attack, it can easily punch holes in the opponent's team. Outside of the sun, Cherubi isn't worth using. It's slow, frail, and doesn't have anything special to make up for these shortcomings. Things could be worse for Cherubi, however, it could have measly base 30 defenses like Bellsprout, or even poor stats all around like Seedot. Cherubi is a great Pokemon if you're playing for fun, but there are better choices for a competitive team.</p>

[SET]
name: Sunny Day
move 1: Sunny Day

move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Growth / Synthesis
item: Heat Rock
nature: Modest
evs: 76 HP / 184 SpA / 240 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The idea behind this set is to use Chlorophyll to boost Cherubi's Speed. When the sun is active, Cherubi reaches 26 Speed, which is enough to outrun Choice Scarf Mankey, as well as Carvanha and Houndour. Cherubi can either set up Sunny Day itself, or have a teammate do it. A Heat Rock prolongs the sun, giving Cherubi eight turns to decimate the opponent's team. SolarBeam is Cherubi's strongest attack, and has an amazing Base Power of 180 after STAB. Hidden Power Fire is boosted by the sun, and it deals a great amount of damage to Bronzor, Chikorita, and Snorunt. In the last slot, Growth can be used to raise Cherubi's Special Attack, while Synthesis is used for recovery.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are fairly straightforward, maximizing Cherubi's Speed and Special Attack with the remaining 76 EVs in HP for an extra point. Grass Knot or Energy Ball can be used in the last slot if you want a reliable option when it isn't sunny, and Giga Drain gets the best of both worlds; it damages the opponent outside of the sun while restoring Cherubi's health. Leech Seed is another option in the last slot to weaken opponents and leech some health, which works well against opponents with high HP.</p>

<p>Pokemon who can set up entry hazards make good teammates. Bronzor and Nosepass can set up Stealth Rock, Snorunt can set up Spikes, and Spinarak can set up Toxic Spikes. Pineco, while weak to Fire-type attacks, can set up all three, and can even provide Rapid Spin support. Gastly makes a good teammate as it can block any attempts to remove the entry hazards with Rapid Spin.<p>

<p>Due to its frailty, Cherubi appreciates Pokemon who can set up the sun. Oddish, Hoppip, and Bronzor are all fine choices due to their bulk, typing, and in Hoppip's case, Speed. Fire-types, such as Ponyta and Houndour, are also good partners as they benefit from the sun boosting their STAB moves, and Flash Fire enables them to switch into the Fire-type moves aimed at Cherubi.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cherubi's movepool is disappointing, to say the least. Aromatherapy can rid Cherubi and its teammates of status, but Cherubi is incredibly frail and unlikely to pull it off. GrassWhistle can be used to put an opponent to sleep, but its shaky 55% accuracy is a major turn off. A Swords Dance set with Seed Bomb and Return may be appealing, but it doesn't provide great coverage and isn't very powerful. A Life Orb can be used for more power, though it comes with recoil damage, and it decreases the sun to 5 turns. Finally, an Oran Berry can restore half of Cherubi's health, but it isn't very useful outside of restoring damage from entry hazards.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best way to counter Cherubi is to change the weather. Without active sun, Cherubi is essentially useless, and very slow. Snover activates permanent hail upon switching in, which damages Cherubi every turn. Fire-types such as Houndour and Ponyta resist Grass- and Fire-type moves, and they can KO Cherubi with their STAB moves. Dragon-types such as Dratini also resist Cherubi's STAB, and they can proceed to KO with their powerful moves, or simply set up with Dragon Dance. Mantyke and Drowzee have high Special Defense, and they can wall Cherubi all day. Finally, if worst comes to worst, just Taunt it. Cherubi won't be doing much without the sun, and it won't be able to recover or leech your health either.</p>
