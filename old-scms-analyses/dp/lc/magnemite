[OVERVIEW]

<p>Magnemite may seem like a dull toy compared to other Electric-types, but it is actually an incredible Pokemon. Its high Special Attack stat allows it to deal major damage to a variety of foes. With Magnet Pull, Magnemite can check threats such as Aron and Bronzor quite reliably, and thanks to its ability to hit 22 Speed with a Choice Scarf, it can counter slower Scarf users as well. Due to Magnemite having the most resistances in the game and passable defenses, it has plenty of favorable match-ups. Overall, Magnemite is a threat that should never be underestimated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Magnemite is the premier Steel-type trapper in Little Cup, being able to easily trap and remove every Steel-type excluding Rock Polish Aron. Thanks to Magnemite's plethora of resistances, it can comfortably switch into a move it resists, set up Substitute and Magnet Rise, and attack. Magnet Rise, in conjunction with Substitute, allows Magnemite to avoid dangerous Earthquakes as well as harmful status. Thunderbolt is Magnemite's main STAB attack, doing tons of damage to most Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice strikes Dratini and the Grass-types that would otherwise wall this set. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire is an option for attacking opposing Magnemite and Snover, while still being able to hit Grass-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>The Speed EVs make Magnemite faster than common Steel-types so it can use Magnet Rise or Substitute in time. Max Special Attack EVs allow Magnemite to dish out as much damage as possible. The leftover EVs are stored into HP and Defense for additional bulk. If Hidden Power Fire is being used, then an EV spread of 76 HP / 240 SpA / 160 Spe should be used to compensate for the loss of Speed and Special Attack.</p>

<p>This set partners well with Pokemon such as Taillow that appreciate the removal of Steel-type Pokemon, especially Bronzor. Even using another Steel-type, like Aron, on your team can work well as it no longer has to worry about being walled by Bronzor.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>By employing a Choice Scarf, Magnemite can fill both the role of a Steel killer and a revenge killer, but will have greater problems against foes like Earthquake Bronzor. Thunderbolt is the STAB move of choice here, dealing a lot of damage to almost every Pokemon that isn't immune to it. This set, however, will take a battering from specially-offensive variants of Bronzor due to the reduction in Special Defense, even with its resistances. Thunderbolt is Magnemite's STAB move and provides good coverage. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB attack, and is used to hit Gligar and Dratini as hard as possible. Hidden Power Ground can be used to do more damage to Electric-types, most notably Chinchou, while Hidden Power Grass allows Magnemite to hit Ground-types, such as Phanpy, harder. Lastly, Explosion is a great last resort move to defeat Pokemon that wall Magnemite, such as Munchlax.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>This set is a great counter to Dragon Dance Dratini, one of the biggest threats in the current Little Cup metagame; in addition to its resistance to ExtremeSpeed, Magnemite is able to outspeed Dratini even after a Dragon Dance and proceed to beat it with Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Ice. As such, Pokemon that benefit from Dratini's removal, such as Fire- and Grass-types, are welcome on Magnemite's side.</p>

<p>Pokemon that don't like Steel-types appreciate Magnemite's support. In addition, this Magnemite also works fine with Pokemon that Dratini can easily set up on, such as Fire- and Grass-types. Two interesting teammates for this set are Gligar and Lileep. Their two biggest counters are Bronzor and Snover, both of which can be severely hurt by Magnemite's Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon, allowing Gligar and Lileep to sweep much more easily. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Life Orb Magnemite is an underrated threat that can take down many bulky opponents. Possessing a powerful 26 Special Attack means that Magnemite can hit extremely hard, even through resistances. Thunderbolt is the main STAB move, dealing lots of damage to most Pokemon. Flash Cannon makes a good auxiliary STAB to catch off-guard Ground-types, such as Gligar, on the switch in. Because of Magnet Pull, Magnemite can also come in on Steel-types such as Bronzor that lack Earthquake, and proceed to Thunderbolt them to death without worrying about it switching. Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ice both allow Magnemite to defeat Grass-types that do well against this set otherwise. Additionally, Hidden Power Fire helps against opposing Magnemite, while Hidden Power Ice has the ability to OHKO Gligar and do more damage to Dratini than Flash Cannon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Gligar is a great teammate for Life Orb Magnemite. It has good synergy with Magnemite, and the ability to scout opponents with U-turn, easily allowing Magnemite to come back in to deal more damage. Gligar also deals with Munchlax reasonably well, so Magnemite does not have to rely on Explosion to take out a special wall. Snover is also a helpful teammate, as it is quite good for dealing with Chinchou, another Pokemon that Magnemite must sacrifice itself in order to beat; it can Energy Ball for an OHKO while not taking much damage from any of Chinchou's attacks. If you predict a Gligar switch-in, Magnemite can eliminate it with Hidden Power Ice. As such, Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Gligar, such as Scarf Machop and Mankey, are good teammates; once Gligar is out, they can easily use DynamicPunch and Close Combat respectively to sweep without repercussions. An alternative EV spread of 240 SpA / 240 Spe could be used if you want Magnemite to outrun more Pokemon, though the loss of bulk could prove problematic. With that EV spread, a Naive nature is recommended so that Magnemite reaches 15 Speed, thus outspeeding common threats that sit at 14 Speed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Magnemite has the sturdiness to survive a Croagunk's Vacuum Wave, provided you run a neutral nature and take off a Speed point and put it in Special Defense. It can also run Hidden Power Fighting to better deal with Aron, Porygon, and Houndour switch-ins. Charge Beam can be used to attempt a sweep late game, but its downside is Magnemite's low Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The single best counter to Magnemite is Porygon. It can Trace Magnemite's Magnet Pull, thus preventing Magnemite from escaping, and then use a Recover/attack strategy to slowly destroy Magnemite. Porygon can also use Trick Room to turn Magnemite's Choice Scarf into a liability. However, Porygon must beware of the Attacker set because the damage output will bypass the health healed from Recover. Munchlax can also beat Magnemite due to its high Special Defense stat and access to Earthquake. Both Porygon and Munchlax must beware of Explosion, however. Croagunk cannot switch in directly into Magnemite, but it can come in after a teammate has fainted and revenge kill Magnemite with Vacuum Wave.</p>

<p>Other counters depend greatly on which set and Hidden Power is being used. Any Fighting-type holding a Choice Scarf or Choice Band can easily beat non-Choiced Magnemite. Chinchou is resistant to both of Magnemite's STAB attacks, and will gain health if it comes in on a Thunderbolt, though it must be very wary of Explosion.</p>
