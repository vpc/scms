[Overview]

<p>Wingull is an interesting Pokémon and has a few uses in Little Cup. Its immunity to Ground-type moves, along with STAB Air Slash, can be a boon in a metagame such as Little Cup. However, Wingull faces a lot of competition from Mantyke, who has much better defensive stats. Wingull also has a lack of Water-type STAB moves. Aside from that, it has a poor ability that doesn't help it. Despite its frail stats overall, though, Wingull's niche in the metagame means that it should always be considered when building a team, and shouldn't be underestimated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>STAB Air Slash hits some very common threats in the metagame, such as Snover, Machop and Croagunk, for super effective damage, and also 3HKOes Munchlax. It also has a 30% flinch rate, which can also be very useful. Ice Beam OHKOes Gligar, and gets good coverage with Hidden Power Ground / Grass and Air Slash. Hidden Power Ground / Grass hits all Pokémon that resist Air Slash and Ice Beam for at least neutral damage. It does between 75% to 90% to Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass goes well with Brine so that Wingull can hit Water-type Pokémon super effectively. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ground is the better choice if Shock Wave is being used, since it can OHKO Aron while hitting other Rock-types hard. Brine is very useful later on in the game if all of your opponent's Pokémon are under 50% health, and is Wingull's best Water-type STAB move. Shock Wave OHKOes Mantyke and has no other particular uses. Quick Attack finishes off weakened Pokémon, and can be used to get past Croagunk's Sucker Punch.</p>

<p> The EVs allow Wingull to reach an impressive 19 Speed and 15 Special Attack with Timid Nature. 2 HP IVs give Wingull 19 HP so it can take advantage of Life Orb and its base 70 Hidden Power Grass. </p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Wingull works best with Stealth Rock support, but having Light Screen and Rapid Spin support can boost Wingull's staying power. Chinchou and can take advantage of Wingull's 4x weakness to Electric-type moves. Wingull works well with Aron, since it can switch in to Ground- and Fighting-type moves to an extent.</p>

item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive / Rash
evs: 240 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Scarf Wingull outspeeds several dangerous Scarf users, such as Machop, Mankey, and Snover. It can also hit them with its STAB Air Slash for super effective damage. U-turn is useful in scouting and even revenge killing. Ice Beam OHKOes Scarf Gligar, which Wingull outspeeds with a Naive nature. Wingull also outspeeds Bagon and Dratini at +1 Speed. Hidden Power Ground or Grass hits most Rock-types and Chinchou for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ground is useful against Aron which Wingull outspeeds even after it a Rock Polish. Hidden Power Grass also hits several other Water-types. With a Naive nature and 236 Speed EVs, Wingull hits 28 Speed. Rash Wingull ties with Gligar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Chinchou and Ground-types work well with Wingull due to their natural type synergy. Pokémon that can set up hazards such as Stealth Rock are helpful; a good Pokemon who can do this would be Sandshrew, who resists Rock, can fall back to Wingull for its Water-type weakness, and can also Rapid Spin away entry hazards such as Stealth Rock from your side of the field.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Wingull can run an anti-lead set with Air Slash, Quick Attack, and Hidden Power, getting favorable match-ups against formidable leads such as Snover and Machop.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Munchlax is the best counter to Wingull, as it doesn't get 2HKOed by any of its attacks, and can easily dispose of it with STAB Return. Mantyke and Aron are also good checks too, though they need to watch out for Shock Wave and Hidden Power Ground, respectively. Aside from that, Stealth Rock also hurts Wingull significantly when it switches, meaning that in conjunction with Life Orb recoil, Wingull won't last long.</p>
