[Overview]

<p>Anorith has good stats, excellent dual STABs, and reliable offensive moves to back them up, but its prowess in Little Cup is slightly shaky. Its Rock typing gives it a weakness to two of the most popular priority attacks in the game, while its Bug typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock. On top of this, nearly all of the Pokemon who can beat it sit comfortably at the top of Little Cup and show no signs of being displaced. Despite all this, Anorith's merits cannot be denied. It is both fast and powerful, with access to boosting moves to stress both points. Although its typing is terrible defensively, it is undoubtedly a godsend offensively. All in all, Anorith has the potential to be one of the best sweepers or supporters in Little Cup, given the right teammates.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Anorith can run a Choice set reasonably effectively due to good Speed and Attack backed up by an excellent STAB combination. In general, an Adamant nature should be used with a Choice Scarf to promote attacking power, while a Jolly nature should be used with a Choice Band to salvage lost Speed. With a Jolly nature and a Choice Band, Anorith reaches 28 Attack and 18 Speed, while with an Adamant nature and a Choice Scarf, it has 20 Attack and 25 Speed. The Choice Band allows Anorith to become a force to be reckoned with in Little Cup, with very little being able to switch into it risk-free. On the other hand, the Choice Scarf set is usually played more as a late-game cleaner and makeshift revenge killer, taking down broken or weakened teams.</p>

<p>X-Scissor is Anorith's main STAB attack and its most reliable form of late-game offense. Rock Slide is used as a secondary STAB move, as sadly Anorith does not get Stone Edge, though the flinch chance somewhat mitigates this loss in power. The remaining two moves are used for coverage purposes; Brick Break helps destroy Steel-types who resist Anorith's STAB moves, while the fourth slot covers the only other type that resists both Rock- and Bug-type attacks: Fighting. In general, the best way to damage Machop and Croagunk without locking Anorith into a weak move is to use a strong neutral attack, as Anorith's movepool is fairly shallow. Double-Edge is very powerful, but causes recoil damage, while Body Slam can allow Anorith to get some lucky paralysis on the opposing team, which can help out against potential revenge killers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Aerial Ace can also be used to weaken the Fighting-types who are typically the first to switch in on Anorith, therefore allowing a Pokemon such as Teddiursa to sweep more easily. However, Aerial Ace has few uses aside from this, not to mention that there are other Pokemon such as Gligar who are also liable to switch in. In general, Double-Edge and Body Slam have greater neutral coverage and less risk attached compared to Aerial Ace. Crush Claw is also worth consideration for the 50% chance of a Defense drop, though having a Choice item makes it difficult to capitalize on this.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is very useful for helping Anorith sweep because not only does it chip off HP from bulkier opponents such as Gligar, but it also breaks the Focus Sash of foes like Gastly. Additionally, Rapid Spin support is beneficial, as Anorith will survive at most four switches in with Stealth Rock on the field, and as this is a Choice set, Anorith is very likely to be switching often. By far the greatest threats to Choice Anorith are Fighting-types, and it is all too easy to allow a Pokemon like Croagunk to set up on Anorith's Choice-locked X-Scissor. In this situation, Gastly and Gligar are your best bets provided that Croagunk lacks the moves to deal with them.</p>

<p>Essentially, the two biggest threats to Choice Anorith are Pokemon who resist the move Anorith is locked into and faster revenge killers. Diglett is more than capable of removing Anorith when it is locked into Rock Slide, while Machop and Croagunk can dispose of Anorith with Bullet Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively. There are very few support options that deter revenge killing, though paralysis support can help. Choice Anorith is great at removing slower Pokemon who are weak to one of its moves, such as Slowpoke, Houndour, and Snover, while the Scarf variant is excellent at revenge killing weakened threats. These traits make Anorith a good partner to Pokemon such as Abra and Bellsprout, who may be hindered by the Pokemon whom Anorith can easily handle.</p>

[SET]
name: Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Rapid Spin
move 3: X-Scissor
move 4: Brick Break / Rock Slide
item: Focus Sash
nature: Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Anorith is one of five Pokemon in Little Cup who can learn the combination of Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, which combined with its decent Speed, offensive prowess, and resistance to Fake Out makes it a worthy choice for a lead. While more directly offensive than many other supporting leads, it has an excellent support movepool and is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in Little Cup. Despite a shorter lifespan than the more offensive Anorith sets, as well as being slightly overshadowed by Kabuto due to a lack of priority, a lead is certainly a viable choice for Anorith to take, and can be a great method of support for your team.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin is the main attraction on this set, being able to remove entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock. Anorith can also set up its own Stealth Rock to help your team, breaking the opponent's Focus Sash and building up damage over time. One way to use this Anorith is to attack as the opponent sets up entry hazards, and if it has a Focus Sash, use Rapid Spin to not only dispose of it outright but also to remove the entry hazards it set up. X-Scissor is Anorith's main STAB attack, dealing a good amount of damage to most other leads, in particular the frailer leads such as Meowth and Diglett. It can also 3HKO Bronzor through its Oran Berry, something Kabuto cannot do. For the last slot, Brick Break is the best option to take down Pokemon who resist X-Scissor, such as Aron, deal more damage to Kabuto and Meowth, and break screens set up by leads such as Bronzor, although it does leave Anorith helpless against Gastly and Drifloon. Remember that Rock Slide is always available as an alternative secondary STAB for the popular Ghost- and Flying-types of Little Cup.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash is the preferred item to survive stronger blows, though Lum Berry is also an option to block Hypnosis from Meowth and Gastly leads. The Pokemon who benefit most from Anorith's support are those who are most affected by entry hazards; for example, Houndour is weak to Stealth Rock and, as such, greatly benefits from its removal from the field, and Grass-types such as Bellsprout can more easily deal with Fire-, Flying-, Bug-, and Ice-types after they make a couple of switches into Stealth Rock. It is mostly sweepers who benefit from Anorith's particular brand of support, since Stealth Rock can weaken opponents and make them easier prey. Dragon Dance Dratini and Agility + Swords Dance Krabby are two examples of boosting sweepers who appreciate not being blocked by a random Focus Sash user.</p>

[SET]

item: Life Orb / Oran Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 Atk / 116 Def / 156 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Anorith has two desirable stat-boosting moves for attempting a sweep: Swords Dance and Rock Polish. This set focuses on the latter move, which boosts Anorith's decent 16 Speed stat to an impressive 32, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO many threats who would otherwise be able to revenge kill it. While slightly better protected against most revenge killers due to its boosted Speed stat and extra Defense EVs, Anorith may often find that it lacks the ability to power through bulky walls such as Bronzor and Gligar. Not only that, but it is still as weak to priority attacks as ever, and has no particularly feasible way of beating Machop and other Fighting-types.</p>

<p>Anorith's two STAB moves make up the core of this moveset once again, while Brick Break provides reasonable coverage against Steel-types. Life Orb is an option if you want to salvage Anorith's lost Attack stat, but it does detract from its ability to survive blows even with the added defensive investment—if you want to increase survivability in this regard, Oran Berry is preferable, but remember that Anorith will lose out on a lot of power. The EVs and nature allow for maximum attacking power while also granting Anorith 16 Speed. The remainder of the EVs grant Anorith two extra points when placed in either Defense or Special Defense, which helps it take hits better and may well be the difference between life and death. Placing them both into Defense is preferable as Anorith is usually better suited at taking physical hits.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Setting Anorith's HP IV to 0 is an option if Life Orb is chosen, causing Life Orb damage to round down to 1 HP per move; while this may sound good on paper, it comes at the price of 2 extra hit points at the start, which limits Anorith's survivability. In the end, it comes down to your personal preference.</p>

<p>In many ways, the Rock Polish set is very similar to the Swords Dance set, with the identical combination of moves and items, and the only real differences being the set-up move of choice, the nature, and a point in Defense in exchange for Speed. However, these two sets in battle are played far more differently than one would expect at first glance. The Swords Dance set needs only to power its way through a slow team, with little to stop it from OHKOing anything it walks into. Thus, the support required hinges deeply in building momentum against the opponent's team through entry hazards and paralysis support, allowing Anorith to channel its power as smoothly as possible for as long as possible. With the Rock Polish sweeper, however, it is critical that any Pokemon who can take a hit, such as Bronzor, Gligar, Hippopotas, and bulky Fighting-types such as Machop, are all gone, since if you are unable to do so, Anorith will not last long, and you would probably have been better off with a Choice set to help with offensive pressure.</p>

<p>Bulky Fighting-types present the biggest problem for this set, because without Swords Dance, it can't just simply muscle its way past them. To deal with them, the best method is to almost always play with resistances, especially with stronger ones like Machop, and then weaken or revenge kill. Ghost-types such as Gastly and Drifloon can come into Choice-locked Fighting-types and set up, while Gligar can take a Fighting attack or two, attack with STAB Earthquake or Aerial Ace, and heal off the damage with Roost. Against Bronzor, Gligar, and Hippopotas, most Pokemon with strong, super effective attacks and decent bulk, such as Krabby, are capable of mauling the walls with ease. Bronzor can be dealt with through strong Fire attacks from Fire-types like Houndour and Ponyta, while Gligar and Hippopotas are crushed by most special Water and Ice attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: X-Scissor
move 4: Brick Break
item: Life Orb / Oran Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Swords Dance Anorith does not provide the same support exhibited by the Choice sets, it makes up for it with raw power, achieving 40 Attack with an Adamant nature after a Swords Dance boost. Even with a Jolly nature, however, this Anorith suffers greatly from revenge killing, more so than the Choice Scarf and Rock Polish variants, and it is usually not bulky enough to survive neutral hits. Weaknesses to Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet does not help it, either. It is also slightly overlooked as a Swords Dance sweeper in favor of Gligar, who has greater bulk and a better movepool along with that essential 19 Speed, though Anorith has its own share of advantages as well.</p>

<p>Swords Dance is the core of this set, allowing Anorith to boost its Attack stat sky-high, OHKO Croagunk with Life Orb Rock Slide, and occasionally take out bulky Machop with Brick Break with some prior damage. Rock Slide and X-Scissor are necessary STAB moves that complement each other quite nicely, and unlike the Choice sets, the opponent cannot simply switch Mantyke into X-Scissor due to the fear of Rock Slide. Only one slot is left for coverage: Brick Break is generally the best choice, since it easily disposes of Steel-types and can also hit bulky Fighting-types for decent damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of item is an important one. Life Orb gives the extra power needed to obtain certain important KOs, and is more useful if you are sure that Anorith can take down priority-wielding opposition, while Oran Berry is more defensively-inclined an item, providing a safeguard against weaker attacks and hopefully either allowing Anorith to get an extra Swords Dance boost or to survive an attempted revenge kill. As for the nature, Adamant is recommended because it gives Anorith a much-needed boost in power, while Jolly provides insurance against other Pokemon by ensuring that Anorith will beat Pokemon at 17 Speed and tie with those at 18 Speed. The EVs are fairly straightforward sweeping EVs, granting Anorith the best possible Attack and Speed, while the rest are given up to an extra point in Defense. Again, you can run 0 HP IVs if you let Anorith hold a Life Orb to minimize the damage taken.</p>

<p>Entry hazards are very valuable since they break the opponent's Focus Sashes and cause residual damage. Rapid Spin support can also be useful, since Anorith is weak to Stealth Rock and having 5 HP spared can make the difference between life and death. Again, the biggest threats to this Anorith come from Fighting-types, particularly Machop, who can switch in, take little to no damage as Anorith sets up, and crush it with Scarf DynamicPunch or Guts Bullet Punch. Nearly any Pokemon with 19 or more Speed, such as Timid Staryu and Jolly Buizel, can work as a revenge killer. A strong Pursuit user such as Scarf Houndour can remove Pokemon such as Choiced Abra and Gastly, and hopefully pick up a Flash Fire boost from Pokemon like Ponyta. Chinchou can take on Staryu and Buizel to a reasonable extent, resisting their STAB and most coverage moves and KOing with STAB Thunderbolt, while Croagunk can come in on their STAB attacks thanks to Dry Skin and KO with Fake Out and Sucker Punch. In Gligar's case, strong Water- or Ice-type attacks should fell it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Anorith's Special Attack is not great, even by Little Cup standards, but it gets a couple of interesting special attacks. Earth Power is an intriguing option that has some utility over Brick Break (especially on the Rock Polish set). By diverting some EVs from Defense to Special Attack, Anorith can not only beat the original targets of Shieldon and Aron, but also OHKO Croagunk. Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal some damage to Gligar. Already mentioned in the set descriptions are Aerial Ace and Crush Claw—Aerial Ace hits the Fighting-types who wall Anorith's STAB moves, though its coverage and power beyond that is poor. Crush Claw has a nice chance of lowering the opponent's Defense as well as having great neutral coverage, but has low Base Power.</p>

<p>On the Rock Polish set, you can lower Anorith's Speed EVs to increase defensive capability if you are sure that Anorith can pull off a Rock Polish boost—76 Speed allows Anorith to hit 30 Speed after the boost, which is still sufficient to outrun every Pokemon of note besides Choice Scarf Diglett. Doing this also allows Anorith to glean another precious point in one of its defensive stats. You should not add EVs to HP unless Life Orb isn't present, which is inadvisable. For the defensive stats, 36 Defense EVs give Anorith one extra point, and 116 gives it two, making either 236 Atk / 196 Def / 76 Spe usable for an extra point in Defense, or 236 Atk / 116 Def / 36 SpD / 76 Spe for an extra point in Special Defense. If you are using Earth Power or another special attack on Anorith, you should move the defensive EVs to Special Attack and use a Naughty or Lonely nature. If you run a Life Orb set, you can run 0 HP IVs to minimize the damage taken from Life Orb.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>It is very difficult to find a hard counter to the Swords Dance set, although bulky Choice Band Machop comes close. It is really much easier to revenge kill than to straight-out wall this set. Abra and Gastly can both outspeed Adamant versions and KO with their STAB attacks, while Croagunk resists every move it uses and has OHKO potential with one of its many priority moves. Machop and Mankey work in the same way, while Choice Scarf variants can outrun and OHKO with their STAB moves. Diglett can trap and revenge kill nearly any Anorith with Earthquake, Sucker Punch, or a super effective Rock Slide, besides the Choice Scarf and Rock Polish sets. Faster Water-types who can OHKO include Poliwag, Staryu, and Buizel, the latter of whom also has STAB Aqua Jet.</p>

<p>The Rock Polish set is far easier to counter per se—it often does not have the power to beat some of the walls which the Swords Dance set can simply hammer through, despite being faster and thus harder to revenge kill. Bronzor can take an X-Scissor and survive with Oran Berry, and Gyro Ball versions can easily KO after Anorith uses Rock Polish. Gligar also easily survives Anorith's attacks, and can stall with Roost or crush Anorith with a super effective Aqua Tail. Hippopotas has Slack Off and STAB Earthquake, but the weather it brings with it can actually help Anorith by increasing its bulk against special attacks. Defensive Water-types with OHKO potential include Tentacool, Krabby, Squirtle, Omanyte, and Kabuto, although the latter two have to be wary of Brick Break if they are not under the rain. Of these, Tentacool resists Anorith's Bug STAB and can OHKO with STAB Surf, Krabby has its trademark Crabhammer available, and Kabuto can blast Anorith away with Aqua Jet. Bulky Fighting-types such as Machop also make fine counters to Rock Polish Anorith.</p>
