[Overview]

<p>Thanks to Adaptability, Eevee can perform well in Little Cup, even with average stats. It also sports a STAB priority move that hits with an effective 80 Base Power, making it a decent revenge killer. With the combination of Return and Quick Attack, not much can stand in Eevee's way other than Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, who are the bane of its existence. Unfortunately, it has poor defenses and is quite slow, and thus is easily revenge killed.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to Adaptability and STAB on both Return and Quick Attack, Eevee can function as both a revenge killer and a wallbreaker. Return is Eevee's strongest move on this set and, courtesy of Adaptability, hits with 204 Base Power, severely hurting anyone who doesn't resist it very hard. Quick Attack works well alongside Return, and allows Eevee to become a potent revenge killer. With Normal-type as its STAB, Ghost-types can be very threatening to Eevee; therefore, Bite is recommended in the third slot. In the final moveslot, Hidden Power Grass is generally the best choice as it OHKOes most Rock / Ground and Rock / Water Pokemon, but Hidden Power Ground is notable for its ability to beat down Aron, Shieldon, and Magnemite.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although Eevee is powerful there are several Pokemon who flat out wall it. Bronzor is a huge problem; it sports a resistance to three of Eevee's attacks, and can easily set up on it. As such, a Fire-type is recommended as a partner, hitting Bronzor and other Steel-types for super effective damage. Without Hidden Power Ground, other Steel-types, such as Aron, also pose a problem. Aron can easily set up on this set without it. A Choice Scarfed Fighting-type like Mankey can remedy this, as it can outspeed and OHKO all of the common Steel-types bar Bronzor. If Hidden Power Ground is used, the Attack EVs can be changed to 236 in order to allow another 36 EVs to go into the Defense stat.</p>

<p>Fighting-types such as Mankey and Machop are serious threats to Eevee with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Wynaut or a Ghost-type can take care of these threats, shrugging off Fighting-type attacks and hitting back with Counter or a STAB attack respectively. Ghost-types such as Drifloon and Gastly are immune to both of Eevee's STAB moves while outspeeding it and KOing with Hidden Power Fighting. Stunky works as a great counter to both Ghost-types thanks to its typing and access to both Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Though this set looks quite similar to the mixed set, the two play very differently. This set is purely physical, and can hit harder or be much faster than the mixed set. With Choice Band's sheer power, Eevee is able to rip holes in the opposition's defense. On the other hand, Choice Scarf makes up for Eevee's lackluster Speed, and lets it function more as a revenge killer. Return is a strong and reliable STAB on Eevee, making it your first choice of attack. Quick Attack is a valuable priority move, allowing Eevee to pick off weakened foes. Bite allows Eevee to switch in on a Ghost-type move such as Shadow Ball, and hit the enemy Ghost-type for super effective damage. With Eevee's risk of being walled, Baton Pass allows Eevee to scout for potential threats, such as the Ghost-types that plague it, so that you can switch to an appropriate counter.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Even with the power supplied by a Choice Band, Eevee fails to 2HKO Bronzor, even without taking Oran Berry into account. Bronzor can be easily beaten by Pokemon such as Houndour and Magby. Onix, with its gargantuan Defense stat and resistance to Normal-type attacks, can wall Eevee with impunity. A Water-type makes a good choice here, as it can abuse Onix's 4x weakness and dispatch of it. Once Eevee is locked into Return, any Ghost-type can come in and easily KO it or set up for a sweep. Stunky and Munchlax are both great choices to combat Ghost-types with their super effective attacks. After KOing an opposing Pokemon, a large number of threats can easily revenge kill Eevee.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Eevee doesn't have a large movepool, but it still has a few moves worth noting. First, Eevee has access to Wish, but this is not very viable due to Eevee's bad defenses. Eevee may utilize a Flail set to push its power to the extreme; however, it is hard to set up correctly, and leaves Eevee easily revenge killed. Next, Yawn may be able to cause switches or create free turns of set-up. Eevee also has Baton Pass, but can only pass Curse and Substitute. Iron Tail can be used over Hidden Power to combat Rock-types, but with 75% accuracy, it is not very reliable. A Curse set can work with Eevee, increasing its Attack and Defense, while Quick Attack nullifies the Speed drops. Unfortunately, this set is very hard to set up, and has trouble with any physically bulky special attacker.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Eevee's best counters are Choice Scarfed Fighting-types such as Mankey, since at 26 Speed with its Choice Scarf, Eevee can't hope to outspeed them. While not as fast, Machop has more bulk than Mankey, and can hit Eevee with DynamicPunch. Any Ghost-type can come in on a Normal-type attack, then wreak havoc by setting up or spreading status. Aron can easily set up on any Eevee without Hidden Power Ground and potentially sweep. Omanyte and Kabuto switch into against any set without Hidden Power Grass, though Choice Banded Return will do a fair amount. Bronzor walls Eevee, and can set up on it with impunity. Onix has a high Defense stat and a resistance to Eevee's STAB attacks, and has enough power to threaten it with a STAB. Choice Scarf Gastly can very easily revenge kill Eevee, while Duskull can usually wall it extremely well.<p>
