[Overview]

<p>Bronzor is one of the most defensive Pokemon in Little Cup thanks to its typing and stats. Although it is not able to use Hypnosis because it is a genderless Pokemon, it still has many support options that it can use effectively. As with Bronzong in OU, however, one must beware that Bronzor does not have much offensive capability and allows setup from Pokemon who resist its attacks.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bronzor is a great utility Pokemon and is easily one of the best users of Stealth Rock in the tier. The combination of Psychic and Earthquake hits many common Pokemon for super effective damage, preventing Pokemon such as Houndour and Gastly from taking advantage of Bronzor. The last moveslot can be customized to fit any given team's needs. Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes Gligar, while Light Screen or Reflect can be used for extra team support. Light Screen also allows Bronzor not to be OHKOed by non-Life Orb Houndour's Fire Blast, while Reflect gives Bronzor an easier time against the physical threats it will likely switch into. Keep in mind that if Hidden Power Ice is not used in the fourth slot, 4 EVs can be taken away from both Attack and Defense.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Other options for the fourth moveslot include Flash Cannon, Trick, and Recycle. Flash Cannon can be used for another STAB attack, although it doesn't hit anything in particular. Trick can be used to steal opposing Oran Berries, which increases Bronzor's longevity while diminishing the opponent's. Recycle is not implemented on Shoddy Battle, but can be used to continually receive healing from Oran Berry. The EVs are geared towards Defense, as many threats that Bronzor will check on a team are physically oriented. If a more balanced EV spread is desired, 60 HP / 8 Atk / 152 Def / 4 SpA / 228 SpD / 12 Spe can be used, giving Bronzor even defenses of 23 HP / 18 Defense / 18 Special Defense. This allows Bronzor to take special hits slightly better, while physical moves will hit around 4% harder.</p>

<p>With this set, Bronzor also makes an acceptable lead, as it is able to combat common leads such as Meowth, Aipom, Snover, Diglett, and Kabuto. If you choose to use Bronzor in the lead slot, Lum Berry can be used to protect Bronzor from Meowth's Hypnosis and confusion from Machop's DynamicPunch.</p>

<p>Bronzor's main uses on a team are to tank Normal-, Ground-, and Rock-type attacks and to check Gligar. Therefore, Pokemon who dislike these things make great teammates. Lead Machop usually loses to Fake Out leads such as Meowth and Aipom, so it appreciates Bronzor coming in to take those hits and set up Stealth Rock. Other Pokemon such as Chinchou and Snover are in a similar boat. Bronzor itself needs partners to beat Fire-types who are common switch-ins, as well as Mantyke and Munchlax. Munchlax can tank most hits from Houndour and Mantyke and strike back hard, as can Chinchou. Other Water-types can also do this. Gligar or Fighting-types, such as Machop and Mankey, can hurt Munchlax, though it is difficult to switch them in.</p>

[SET]
name: Field Effect Support
move 1: Rain Dance / Trick Room
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Stealth Rock
item: Damp Rock / Oran Berry
nature: Relaxed
ability: Levitate
evs: 220 HP / 8 Atk / 152 Def / 4 SpA / 68 SpD / 12 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Because of Bronzor's great typing, it is an excellent choice for setting up field effects. Damp Rock should be used if Rain Dance is chosen for the first moveslot, and Oran Berry should be used with Trick Room. Psychic and Earthquake are present to hit Pokemon who are threatening to Bronzor. Hidden Power Ice is solely for hitting Gligar, but Stealth Rock can be used instead to provide more support for the team. If Stealth Rock is chosen, 4 EVs can be taken from both Attack and Defense.</p>

<p>Bronzor is particularly good as a Rain Dance user because it can easily check two Pokemon who give Rain Dance teams lots of trouble: Snover and Croagunk. It also lures in Fire-type Pokemon, who provide easy switch-ins for most Rain Dance sweepers once rain is up. Furthermore, Rain Dance nullifies Bronzor's weakness to Fire-type attacks, effectively giving it no weaknesses.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Rain Dance Bronzor should be used on teams centered around Rain Dance. Thus, good partners for it are rain sweepers, such as Mantyke, Buizel, Kabuto, and Omanyte. Other teammates should also set up Rain Dance. Voltorb is a Pokemon who can set up Rain Dance quickly to offset Bronzor's slow Rain Dance, and works well type-wise with Bronzor.</p>

<p>Trick Room Bronzor, in a similar vein, should be used on dedicated Trick Room teams. Cubone, Krabby, Munchlax, Machop, and Trapinch are all good Trick Room sweepers. Pokemon other than Bronzor to set up Trick Room include Slowpoke, Porygon, Duskull, Exeggcute, and Shuppet.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Psychic / Stealth Rock
item: Light Clay / Oran Berry
nature: Sassy
ability: Levitate
evs: 220 HP / 4 Atk / 148 Def / 4 SpA / 68 SpD / 12 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bronzor is one of the best Pokemon in Little Cup for setting up dual screens. Light Clay increases the length of both Light Screen and Reflect to 8 turns, allowing Bronzor to better support the rest of the team. Oran Berry can be used, but keep in mind that the screens will not last nearly as long. Earthquake and Psychic once again are present to hit common threats to Bronzor. Stealth Rock can be used over either Earthquake or Psychic if you need Bronzor to set it up. The choice should be dependent on the rest of your team; if Houndour or Chinchou is troublesome, keep Earthquake, but if Gligar or Gastly seems more threatening, keep Psychic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Setup Pokemon operate best with dual screens up. Oran Berry Krabby is bulky enough to set up a Swords Dance or an Agility (or both!) and sweep. Anorith, Dratini, Gligar, and Bagon can all attempt to do something similar.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick
move 1: Gyro Ball
move 2: Trick
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Trick Room / Hidden Power Electric
item: Macho Brace
nature: Brave
ability: Levitate
evs: 220 HP / 244 Atk / 4 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Speed stat of 3, Bronzor can hit many things in Little Cup with a 150 Base Power STAB Gyro Ball, which will dent or KO many things, despite Bronzor's average Attack stat. Trick might appear strange, weakening Gyro Ball's damage output, but it can cripple a key Pokemon for the rest of the match, such as Gligar. Earthquake complements Gyro Ball by hitting most Pokemon that resist it for at least neutral. The last slot is a toss-up between hitting Mantyke without Tricking Bronzor's Macho Brace away, or setting up Trick Room to help Bronzor attempt a more full-blown sweep. If running Hidden Power Electric, a 3 Speed IV is the lowest Bronzor can go with a full-powered Hidden Power. You will also need to add 4 more EVs to Special Attack.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>Psychic can be used in the last slot to cover a broader range of Pokemon. Rock Slide would be Bronzor's best move against both Mantyke, who resists Gyro Ball and is immune to Earthquake, and Paras, who is slow enough to set up on Bronzor's Gyro Ball, and has a 4x resistance to Earthquake. Mantyke already detests being Tricked a Macho Brace though, and Paras can Spore poor Bronzor before it can even use Rock Slide. Krabby also resists Bronzor's main STAB move and has enough Defense to take an Earthquake. Krabby can't stomach a Hidden Power Electric, though.</p> 

<p>This section is to help show when it is wise to use Gyro Ball and when it is not. It should also demonstrate the big drop in power when not using Macho Brace.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Heatproof can be used as an ability instead of Levitate, but there is very little to be gained by doing so. While Spikes are uncommon in Little Cup to tip the opponent off, it still leaves Bronzor unable to safely switch into Gligar, Diglett, and other Earthquake users. Although it prevents non-Life Orb Houndour's Fire Blast from OHKOing, Bronzor can't OHKO most Houndour back with Earthquake, so there is generally no reason to want to take the Fire-type attack.</p>

<p>Gyro Ball can be used as an attack on any of the main sets, but Bronzor is usually so strapped for moveslots that it isn't worth it, especially considering how weak Gyro Ball is without Macho Brace. Bronzor can run Protect to scout Choice items as well as to rack up residual damage. Bronzor can also potentially pull off a Calm Mind set, although it lacks reliable recovery and is strapped for moveslots.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Houndour, Magby, and other Fire-types threaten Bronzor with STAB Fire Blast as long as they aren't brought in on Earthquake. Mantyke can come in safely on every move, and set up Rain Dance or just blast away with a strong STAB Hydro Pump. Most Water-types, such as Staryu and Chinchou, can come in and hit Bronzor pretty hard as well. Gastly must avoid Psychic, but it can put Bronzor to sleep with Hypnosis and then set up a Substitute.</p>

<p>Wynaut is a big threat to Bronzor, as it can come in on any of its moves and Encore, dealing with the situation accordingly. Magnet Rise Magnemite can also trap and kill Bronzor, as long as it is not brought in on Earthquake. While Munchlax does not particularly enjoy taking Earthquakes, it can take a couple and hit Bronzor back with a super effective Fire Punch. Bulky Pokemon with recovery moves, such as Lileep and Slowpoke, will beat Bronzor one-on-one. In general, Pokemon who aren't hit too hard by Bronzor's attacks and can set up make great switch-ins to Bronzor. Examples of these are Shroomish and Paras.</p>
