[Overview]

<p>With Little Cup being such a Speed-based metagame, Croagunk definitely has found its niche. With its amazing slew of strong priority attacks, Croagunk is one of the prime revenge killers and sweepers. Croagunk is also easy to fit onto almost any team since it boasts an invaluable Water immunity along with resistances to Dark, Fighting, Rock, Grass, Poison, and Bug to compensate for its mediocre defenses. This makes Croagunk a very reliable Pokemon, often capable of holding a team together under pressure. Croagunk may not sweep as often as some Pokemon, but its ability to check a large number of threats makes it a valuable asset to any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on reliably revenge killing your opponent's sweepers. Croagunk has access to more priority attacks than anyone else in Little Cup, most notably Vacuum Wave and Sucker Punch. Fake Out allows Croagunk to hit a Pokemon twice before they attack once. This gives Croagunk the ability to revenge kill Choice Scarf users and most other Pokemon with a Speed boost (so long as they are not named Dratini!). Croagunk also has room for Ice Punch or Dark Pulse to hit Gligar and Ghost-types respectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set is one of the greatest and most unique revenge killers in Little Cup, because it effectively outspeeds every Pokemon with a Speed boost. Fake Out coupled with Sucker Punch or Vacuum Wave OHKOes a good portion of the metagame. Croagunk also has another advantage over conventional, Choice Scarfed, revenge killers: Fake Out breaks Focus Sash and allows Croagunk to beat Sashers who Choice Scarf revenge killers would have trouble with.</p>

<p>The last slot is to cover one of Croagunk's most common switch-ins. Ice Punch deals with Gligar, and gives Croagunk a reliable way of breaking any Ghost's Substitute. Dark Pulse, on the other hand, will catch Wynaut off guard and hit Ghost-types harder than Ice Punch. Another option is Hidden Power Psychic which OHKOes opposing Croagunk and Gastly.</p>

<p>Croagunk has trouble pulling off revenge kills if the opponent has Pokemon who don't mind switching into its attacks. Gligar, Gastly, Munchlax, and Wynaut in particular are the most common switch-ins, so the removal of them is essential for Croagunk to function properly. Gligar and Munchlax are both stopped by Duskull or bulky Drifloon, since they can just burn and KO Gligar, while slowly wearing down Munchlax. Since Wynaut and Gastly both have trouble dealing with Stunky (as long as it carries Crunch) it is also a good teammate for Croagunk.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set's premise is quite simple: use Nasty Plot and sweep with Vacuum Wave. This set also uses Sucker Punch, making use of Croagunk's decent Attack. Sucker Punch also gives Croagunk a way to stop Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon from revenge killing it. Sucker Punch and Vacuum Wave together are nearly unresisted in Little Cup, aside from one popular Pokemon: Croagunk. Shadow Ball allows Croagunk to hit opposing Croagunk and Gligar for neutral damage, reliably hit Ghost-types with Substitute, OHKO Wynaut after a Nasty Plot, and have perfect coverage alongside Vacuum Wave.</p>

<p>Since bulky variants of Gligar won't mind switching into a neutral Shadow Ball, Ice Punch is a viable option. While not using the Nasty Plot boost, Ice Punch still reliably hits Ghost-types and hits Paras for super effective damage, as well as OHKOing Gligar. If Munchlax really troubles you, Low Kick can be used. It should be noted that using Low Kick takes away from Croagunk's sweeping power due to redundant coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This variant of Croagunk has trouble with Ghost-types, but its biggest setback is that it doesn't have a powerful STAB attack. This means Pokemon such as Munchlax and Lickitung will easily dispose of Croagunk thanks to their high Special Defense. They can be beaten down by strong physical attacks; however, they will not be tempted to switch or stay in on a powerful physical attacker, meaning mixed attackers are better lures. Houndour is a great candidate for this role, because it lures in the main special walls, and hits them hard with Crunch. Gastly with Substitute and Explosion can also function as a great teammate for Croagunk, especially with the ability to switch into the ever-common Ground-types who may come in on the frail frog.</p>

<p>Wynaut is also quite effective with Nasty Plot Croagunk, since it can remove Pokemon such as Gligar. Wynaut can also help Croagunk set up by Encoring one of the many attacks it resists.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Sucker Punch

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to take advantage of the classic Substitute and Focus Punch combination. Croagunk can come in on something that it can force out (such as a Choice locked Water move), and Substitute on the switch. Croagunk now gets a free STAB Focus Punch to smash the opponent’s face with. Ice Punch is used for Gligar and Drifloon only; a resisted Focus Punch will hurt more than a neutral Ice Punch on any other target. Sucker Punch is great on this set, as your opponents will be forced to attack to break your Substitute, almost eliminating prediction wars when using Sucker Punch. It’s also great for grabbing quick KOs on Pokemon who you fail to OHKO with Focus Punch.</p>

<p>The option of Muscle Band versus Life Orb comes down to personal preference. Just be aware that if you don't manage to heal Croagunk by switching into a Water-type attack, you can only Substitute three times at best with a Life Orb equipped.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This is Croagunk's most effective wall-breaking set. When behind a Substitute, the opponent will almost always need to sacrifice a defensive Pokemon to break Croagunk's Substitute. This means fast sweepers like Elekid really appreciate Croagunk as a teammate, since Elekid loves it when walls are down as it has an easier time cleaning up. You could replace Sucker Punch with Payback on this set to decent effect. This gives Croagunk a more reliable attack against Gastly and Duskull, who can just stall Sucker Punch with Hypnosis or Will-O-Wisp respectively.</p>

<p>Croagunk needs some support for this set to work effectively, since getting a Substitute up is no easy task. Rock-types such as Rhyhorn and Aron help Croagunk get a Substitute up because they lure Water- and Fighting-type attacks. Wynaut will also aid Croagunk in getting a Substitute, especially since Wynaut lures in Dark- and Bug-type attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A purely special Nasty Plot set can work decently for Croagunk; however, it is almost completely outclassed by the mixed set for a couple of reasons. The main advantage the pure Nasty Plot set would give is the ability to OHKO Munchlax with a +2 Hidden Power Fighting; however, lacking Sucker Punch means it can be revenge killed by everything that is faster and isn't KOed by Vacuum Wave which is quite detrimental to the set's viability. A Bulk Up set could work, but Croagunk does not really have the bulk (pun intended) to use it effectively; Croagunk is still easily OHKOed by many of the most common Croagunk counters such as Gligar.</p>

<p>On the physical side, Poison Jab was left out due to Poison having poor coverage, and having better available options. Other physical options include Rock Slide, X-Scissor, Brick Break, Earthquake, and ThunderPunch. However, these are lesser options on any set because many of the moves are needed for power, coverage, priority, and Gligar. Gunk Shot is an incredibly powerful Poison-type attack, but its shaky accuracy makes it not worth it.</p>

<p>Choice Band and Choice Specs are both viable options on Croagunk because of its above average attacking stats and great movepool. Additionally, Croagunk can still utilize its priority attacks on both sets. While it seems like a good option at first glance, it is rarely a good idea to be locked into Fighting-type attacks due to the presence of Ghosts-types and Gligar in the metagame. Additionally, being locked into priority attacks is a gamble as well; many Pokemon can easily set up on something like Bullet Punch or Sucker Punch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Duskull and Gastly are really good counters. They can come in on anything Croagunk has to offer (barring the rare Shadow Ball, Dark Pulse, or Payback) and threaten it. Even if Croagunk packs Sucker Punch, Gastly can just put Croagunk to sleep with Hypnosis, while Duskull can burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Wynaut is also a great counter, since it can come in on any resisted or neutral attack except Nasty Plot and beat Croagunk. Wynaut can avoid Sucker Punch with Encore, though it should be noted that Counter will trigger Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>Tentacool resists both of Croagunk's STABs and has high Special Defense to sponge hits. Grimer can come in and set up Curse on Croagunk (as long as Croagunk does not have Earthquake). Koffing takes little from Croagunk's STAB attacks, is neutral to Dark, and has Will-O-Wisp and Flamethrower to counter the poisonous frog. Bronzor works well for countering priority Croagunk; however, it needs to be careful around SubPunch and Nasty Plot sets. Gligar can completely wall Ice Punchless Croagunk, and easily KO it with Earthquake. Diglett is a great revenge killer for Croagunk, with Arena Trap, and the ability to survive a Vacuum Wave and OHKO with Earthquake. Diglett does lose to the pure priority variant barring perfect Sucker Punch prediction.</p>

<p>Since Croagunk often relies on priority, using Pokemon who are faster than Croagunk and OHKO it with their own priority are great revenge killers. After Life Orb recoil, Pokemon such as Eevee and Zigzagoon OHKO Croagunk with Quick Attack and ExtremeSpeed respectively (as long as they carry a Life Orb of their own).</p>
