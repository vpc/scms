[Overview]

<p>Many feel that the lack of Technician really hurts Glameow's prospects of being the Fake Out lead of choice. However, Glameow's access to Sucker Punch and STAB Quick Attack make it potent at revenge killing threats with a considerable amount of HP, something Meowth does not do quite as well. However, its sub-par defenses and reliance on priority mean that anything faster with a priority attack spells doom for Glameow. Don't underestimate Glameow, though, as it can easily deal a hefty amount of damage to your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Nearly anything with a STAB-boosted Fake Out is a good candidate for a Fake Out lead set, and Glameow is no exception. When using a Life Orb, Glameow's Fake Out will be doing considerable damage to most leads, while stopping them from doing anything in return. Fake Out also works well with Sucker Punch, often allowing it to take out most leads with a one-two attack combination. U-turn makes Glameow a useful Fake-turner, allowing you to scout for counters and weaken them at the same time.</p>

<p>The fourth move choice is a matter of preference. Hypnosis allows you to incapacitate one of your opponent's Pokémon temporarily, while Quick Attack gives it yet another priority move to abuse. Lastly, if Gastly and other Ghost-type Pokémon are ruining your day, using Shadow Claw can severely hurt them. However, to come out on top against such Ghost-type Pokémon like Gastly, you will have to predict perfectly and use Sucker Punch on their attack and Shadow Claw when they use Substitute. The choice between Life Orb and Focus Sash depends on whether you want more power behind your attacks or if you want to survive a powerful hit in the lead spot, or have two chances to hit your target with Hypnosis. If you are using a Life Orb, reduce your HP IV to 0 in order to reduce recoil to 1 HP per attack.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Optimally, Glameow's teammates should be able to deal with troublesome opposing leads. Mantyke does this best, as it is capable of switching into Hippopotas and Phanpy easily (watch out for Head Smash), and can also switch into Snover in a pinch. Bronzor also switches into many troublesome leads easily, and can take advantage of them to set up Stealth Rock or screens. When not using Shadow Claw, Stunky can make for a useful midgame teammate, dispatching Ghost-types who can switch into Glameow for free.</p>

<p>Glameow appreciates the removal of Steel- and Ghost-types such as Bronzor and Misdreavus. Magnemite, Stunky, and Choice Scarf Houndour do a good job at removing those two, allowing Glameow to wreak havoc. Since Glameow's main role is that of a priority revenge killer, it pairs well with powerful sweepers who lack priority to finish off their weakened targets. Gastly, Mantyke and Cranidos make good partners as they take down Glameow's counters with relative ease.</p>

<p>Defensively, Glameow is more of a hit-and-run Pokémon, so having bulky Pokémon to switch into the battlefield is recommended. Glameow also benefits from having its side of the field clear of Stealth Rock and Spikes, as they drastically reduce Glameow's survivability, especially when Life Orb is factored in. As such, Glameow should be paired with Taunt leads such as Voltorb or Gligar, or Pokémon with Rapid Spin such as Staryu and Squirtle, when not used in the lead position.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Glameow has few usable moves other than the ones mentioned above. With a Naive nature, Hidden Power Grass may be used on the Lead set to OHKO Kabuto, Omanyte, and Onix. However, Glameow usually has better things to do.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Like most Normal-types, Glameow is badly walled by Bronzor. Gligar and Phanpy can take Glameow's attacks with ease, and provided they avoid Hypnosis, can OHKO Glameow with a STAB Earthquake. Glameow is helpless against Misdreavus when not running Shadow Claw, as Misdreavus can avoid Sucker Punch by using Substitute or burning Glameow with Will-O-Wisp. In reality, most Substitute users give Glameow trouble, forcing it to U-turn out. Choice Scarf Machop is also a solid check, shrugging off Quick Attack thanks to its bulk and OHKOing back with DynamicPunch. Generally, anything faster than Glameow that can survive a priority attack can be used to counter Glameow. Choice Scarf Gligar, Choice Scarf Cranidos, and Choice Scarf Magnemite are Pokémon who can come in on Glameow easily and OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Faster priority users also give Glameow trouble as Sucker Punch fails against faster priority moves.</p>
