[Overview]

<p>Hoppip is rarely seen in Little Cup due to its combination of low base stats and poor typing. However, Hoppip has a great support movepool, which includes Encore, Sleep Powder, and Memento. Hoppip may not seem immediately threatening, but don't let that cute face fool you. Underestimating Hoppip's supporting prowess can easily lead to your team's demise at the hands of one of its teammates.</p>

<p>With this moveset, Hoppip can support the team by scouting the opposition, while crippling a few of their Pokemon along the way. Hoppip can easily switch into a non-damaging move and proceed to Encore, forcing the opponent to switch. When the opponent switches, Hoppip can then cripple the switch-in with Sleep Powder, rendering it useless. At this point, the opponent is most likely going to switch out again, so you have a choice of using either Leech Seed, to gain some health back, or using U-turn, to scout the switch-in and procure some offensive momentum. Oran Berry allows Hoppip to recover health, and is very useful in prolonging Hoppip’s ability to stall.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hoppip greatly benefits from sunlight, which doubles its Speed to 30, allowing it to more effectively do its job. Substitute can be used over Sleep Powder to ease prediction, and works well in tandem with Leech Seed to slowly stall out the opponent’s health. Choice Scarf Pokemon with U-turn pair well with Hoppip. Since Sleep Powder and Stun Spore will be forcing lots of switches, Pokemon with U-turn can effectively scout the opponent's team.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Sleep Powder

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The biggest advantage that Hoppip has over other Sunny Day users is access to both Sleep Powder and Memento. Sleep Powder allows Hoppip to gain a free turn to set up Sunny Day while putting an opposing Pokemon out of commission. Memento is a great move that lets Hoppip effectively make the opponent's Pokemon weakened by halving both their attacking stats, while also giving a completely safe switch-in to a Sunny Day sweeper, as well as six more turns of sunlight to abuse. Finally, Encore allows Hoppip to force switches after having put an opposing Pokemon to sleep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pokemon that benefit from Sunny Day are obvious teammates. Any Pokemon with the ability Chlorophyll or a Fire-type attack, such as Bellsprout, Oddish, and Cyndaquil, is a good teammate for Hoppip. Furthermore, they can now use the powerful SolarBeam without a turn of charging up. Flash Fire Pokemon get a special mention because sunlight benefits the opponent’s Fire-type attacks as well. To defend against the opponent's Fire-type attacks, Flash Fire Pokemon can come in handy to easily absorb the blows while receiving a boost to their own Fire-type moves.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hoppip can beat many common leads by putting them to sleep with Sleep Powder, then using Memento on the switch-in, allowing easy setup for your next Pokemon. If you stray from this method though, then Hoppip can also Encore an opponent, forcing it to repeatedly use a non-threatening move or switch. This lets Hoppip stay useful mid-game, if it survives, after having put another Pokemon to sleep. Protect allows Hoppip to preserve its Focus Sash from the common Fake Out leads of Little Cup.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hoppip's goal is to incapacitate the opponent in numerous ways to help its teammates set up. Setup sweepers and Pokemon with U-turn make good teammates. Setup sweepers can generally set up without danger, while U-turn allows you to scout the opponent's switch-in, giving you the momentum to more easily switch Hoppip in. Substitute Houndour makes a great teammate, having good synergy, and being able to set up Substitute before firing off powerful STAB attacks. Swords Dance Gligar is quite bulky already, and with the help from Memento, it can set up a Swords Dance even more easily, allowing it to destroy many teams with its power. Agility Mantyke is also a good teammate, as it greatly benefits from Memento to help it set up and proceed to do tons of damage to the opponent.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>On the Support set, Synthesis can be used as a form of instant recovery. As a bonus, Synthesis becomes more effective in the sun, allowing Hoppip to stall even longer. Protect can also be used so Hoppip can gain more health from Leech Seed. If Protect is used, Leftovers becomes a viable option, as in two turns, Hoppip will usually heal about 6 HP. U-turn can be an alternative on the Lead set to scout the opponent's team without having to sacrifice Hoppip, but Memento is usually the better option. Reflect can be used on the Support and Sunny Day sets to provide a Defense boost for Hoppip and its teammates.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hoppip outspeeds almost every Pokemon in sunlight, and can stall against most of them. As such, Pokemon that can remove sunlight are great counters. Snover and Hippopotas can easily check it by changing the weather just by switching in, making Hoppip much less of a threat. The change in weather also means Hoppip's teammates cannot benefit from the sunlight either. Pokemon that have access to Ice Shard such as Snover, Swinub and Phanpy do great against Hoppip, knocking it out unless it has a Substitute up. Mankey can switch in on Sleep Powder thanks to Vital Spirit and threaten Hoppip with Ice Punch. Taunt beats Hoppip almost completely, because all of its moves other than U-Turn are shut down by it.</p>
