[OVERVIEW]

<p>Spearow is an underrated threat that many people overlook due to its low defenses and weakness to Stealth Rock. Although Spearow is pretty much outclassed by Doduo, which has higher stats and access to Brave Bird, Spearow has access to U-turn, which allows it to scout for its counters, and Heat Wave, which lets Spearow 2HKO Bronzor with Life Orb's boost factored in. Overall, Spearow is a Pokemon that should not be underestimated, because with the given support, Spearow can really punch holes in the opponent's team.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Return
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Drill Peck / Pluck
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive / Naughty
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 28 SpA / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses primarily on scouting and revenge killing the opponent with Spearow's attacks. Return is Spearow’s main attack, backed up by Drill Peck for a secondary STAB attack, which hits Grass-, Fighting-, and Bug-types harder than Return. Pluck can be used over Drill Peck in order to pick off Oran Berries, and to give Spearow a means of recovery. Heat Wave allows Spearow to hit Steel-types that resist Return and Drill Peck for decent damage, despite its low Special Attack. U-turn is the last attack, allowing Spearow to scout for its counters and bring momentum to your team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Spearow pairs well with Pokemon that can cover Spearow's weaknesses. Bronzor makes a good defensive teammate because it has decent defensive synergy with Spearow, and can set up Stealth Rock to make revenge killing easier. Since Spearow will be locked onto one move, having a Pokemon with Rapid Spin can be greatly beneficial, since it allows Spearow to switch in without losing a quarter of its health. The EV spread maximizes its Attack and Speed stat, while its HP, Defense, and Special Attack stats are boosted by one.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Return
move 2: Quick Attack
move 3: Pluck
move 4: Heat Wave
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive 
evs: 196 Atk / 36 Def / 28 SpA / 196 Spe
ivs: 0 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Spearow can utilize a Life Orb effectively to damage the opponent as much as possible. Pluck is the preferred option over Drill Peck, as it allows Spearow to restore its health by picking off Oran Berries, a common hold item in Little Cup. Quick Attack is Spearow's only form of priority, which helps it finish off weakened Pokemon. Return gives Spearow a powerful STAB move to use, and Heat Wave allows Spearow to hit Steel-types that would otherwise wall this set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Like the Choice set, Spearow appreciates entry hazard support, since it often finds that it just does not have enough power to knock out walls. Phanpy, although weak to Ice-type attacks, resists Rock-type attacks and is immune to Electric-type attacks, meaning that Phanpy can easily switch in to set up Stealth Rock. Like the previous set, the EV spread allows Spearow to reach its maximum potential by maxing Attack and Speed. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense and Special Attack, increasing each stat by one point. No HP EVs are used, along with a 0 HP IV, so that Spearow reaches 19 HP in order for Life Orb's recoil to deal only one damage to Spearow</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Agility
move 3: Pluck
move 4: Return / Roost
item: Oran Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 108 SpD 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite its low defensive stats, Spearow has the ability to Baton Pass Speed boosts well. With the investment in bulk, Spearow can take some hits, set up an Agility or two, and then pass the boosts to a teammate. After an Agility, Spearow reaches 28 Speed, outspeeding every Pokemon bar Choice Scarfed base 85s and above, which are fairly rare. Pluck can often restore Spearow's HP thanks to the abundance of Oran Berry. In the last slot, Return gives Spearow a decent STAB move to use; however, Roost gives Spearow instant recovery, which may help Spearow acquire more Agilities.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Spearow benefits from Pokemon that can Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock hampers Spearow's ability to Baton Pass, and therefore having Pokemon such as Sandshrew will be greatly beneficial. Spearow also likes dual screen support, which allows it to set up much more easily. Machop greatly benefits from Agility boosts, as it can now run a full offensive set boosted by Life Orb to rip open teams. Its natural bulk allows it to survive many priority attacks, and cleanly sweep late-game. Unlike the previous sets, this set invests in bulk so that Spearow can set up more comfortably. The EV spread gives it as much physical bulk as possible by investing in HP and Defense, while the remaining EVs increase Spearow's Special Defense by two points.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sadly, Spearow does not have much other options that it can make good use of. Steel Wing is an option to hurt Rock-types but has poor utility otherwise. Pursuit can be used to guarantee a kill on a weakened Pokemon. Assurance pairs well with entry hazards, dealing double the damage to Pokemon that switch in. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be used on Spearow thanks to its above-average 70 base Speed, as well as having U-turn to immediately switch to a sweeper. However, Spearow is better off just hitting as hard as it can. Lastly, Mirror Move is an option, as Spearow can switch into Aron or Rhyhorn on a predicted Earthquake, then use Mirror Move to knock them out, but is not recommended because of its unreliability.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokemon with decent priority moves can beat Spearow. Fake Out from the likes of Aipom, Meowth, and Croagunk, hurts Spearow quite a lot. Choice Band Eevee can almost always knock out Spearow with Quick Attack if it has switched into Stealth Rock once. However, Spearow may have Quick Attack to counter the opposing Pokemon if they are weakened. Ghost-types such as Gastly can switch in on a predicted Choice-locked Normal-type move, and set up a Substitute before proceeding to hit Spearow's team with powerful attacks. Aron walls Spearow completely, and Rock-types such as Onix, Geodude, and Rhyhorn take very little damage from Spearow's attacks, but all of these counters must beware of U-turn, because Spearow can use it to switch to an appropriate counter.</p>
