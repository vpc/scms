[Overview]

<p>Gible has a habit of getting on opponent's nerves due to its ability Sand Veil, which sets it apart from its fellow Dragon-types. Despite having a mediocre stat distribution, Gible can still be considered as a threat because of its impressive STAB attacks and great type coverage overall. Gible performs best paired with sandstorm, as it can help evade some hits from the opponent to make up for its terrible Defense and Special Defense. Gible displays an array of useful sets, all of which make it a welcome addition on any sandstorm team. Outside of sandstorm it is largely outclassed by Bagon and Dratini.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gible packs quite a punch in Little Cup with Choice Band. It can usually 2HKO the most common walls in Little Cup. Although it may seem Gible is outclassed by its Dragon-type counterparts Dratini and Bagon, this is not the case. Gible has Sand Veil, granting it a 20% evasion increase in sandstorm, which compensates for Gible's mediocre defenses and potentially gives it additional attacks chances - a crucial element for this set. Furthermore, Gible is part Ground-type which gives it a free turn to come in on Electric-type attacks.</p>

<p>Not much can switch in on Choice Band Gible's nearly unresisted Outrage off its impressive 25 Attack. The goal is to switch in Gible on someone who can't damage it effectively. Take maximum advantage of your Ground-typing and switch in on locked-in Rock-type moves from a Choice item. Another way to safely bring Gible in after your Pokémon faints and spam Outrage while hoping your opponent misses because of Sand Veil.</p>

<p>To demonstrate Outrage's power, here are some relevant damage calculations:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation"
<li>+1 Outrage vs max HP / max Def Gligar - 57.69% - 69.23%</li>
<li>+1 Outrage vs 76 HP / min Def Munchlax - 100%</li>
<li>+1 Outrage vs max HP / max Def Hippopotas - 69.23% - 84.62%</li>
<li>+1 Outrage vs max HP / 148 Def Bronzor - 36.00% - 48.00%</li>
<li>+1 Outrage vs max HP / max Def Duskull - 76.19% - 100.00%</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike its fellow Dragon-types, Gible has access to STAB Earthquake which helps him OHKO defensive Omanyte and Kabuto, along with scoring an OHKO on Aron and the much rarer Shieldon. Dragon / Ground coverage is excellent in Little Cup, as only Bronzor resists this combo. Stone Edge is a great move when you want to hit Flying-types without getting locked into Outrage. The final slot depends on the player's personal preference. Fire Blast is a nice way of hitting Bronzor much harder than a boosted Outrage would, as Fire Blast can deal a maximum of 56.00% on max HP / 68 SpD Bronzor and has a high chance of taking it down in 3-4 hits (Oran Berry applied). Dragon Claw could replace Fire Blast on the final slot, if the thought of getting locked in on Outrage is making you nervous. Although hitting Bronzor is essential to this set.</p>

<p>The EVs are rather simple and its to maximize Gible's Attack and its Defense. With the current EVs, Gible can 2HKO defensive Gligar with Outrage and take an Earthquake at the same time, which deals around 65% at most. The EVs also help to beat Bronzor, as Gible will come out on top most of the time because a 4 Atk Bronzor's Earthquake can only deal around 30% damage.

<p>Gible performs best with sandstorm in play to take advantage of its ability, Sand Veil. Hippopotas pairs well with Gible as it provides infinite sandstorm, and enables Gible to dodge a few hits. It is advised that Hippopotas is revealed in early stages of the match, preferably as a lead, so Gible can make an early switch-in and begin to wreak havoc. In addition to Hippopotas's ability, the little hippo has Stealth Rock in its arsenal, which will increase Gible's chances of getting certain 2HKOs and OHKOs.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Stealth Rock / Stone Edge / Hidden Power Ice
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Jolly
evs: 96 HP / 196 Atk / 36 SpA / 180 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a slight variation from the Choice Band set. This patches up Gible's mediocre Speed with a Choice Scarf. Sporting 21 Speed, it can outpace every Pokémon without a Choice Scarf or Speed boost in Little Cup, and it basically helps by striking frail sweepers before they strike you. Choice Scarf Gible can be versatile, because it can function well as an effective lead or as a great revenge killer.</p>

<p>Outrage is your primary move which can OHKO almost every frail Pokémon in Little Cup, while Earthquake allows Gible to hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. Earthquake also acts as a secondary STAB move, if you don't want to get locked into Outrage. Fire Blast rounds off the Dragon / Ground / Fire coverage and generally helps put up a fight against Bronzor, as it deals a maximum of 48.00%, enough to 3-4HKO it even with Oran Berry.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since Gible can function as an effective lead, the plan is too overwhelm and outpace frail leads such as Meowth, Diglett, and Houndour. Thanks to Choice Scarf, it can get the drop on all of those Pokémon and 2HKO them with Earthquake - assuming they all have Focus Sash; otherwise Earthquake will OHKO. 96 HP EVs are allocated to help Gible cushion hits from opposing leads and, in return, Gible can strike them back with Earthquake. Diglett in particular will fail to OHKO with Earthquake, but Gible must watch out for a potential Sucker Punch, which will foil your plan to 2HKO it with Earthquake. Gible is sturdy enough to survive Dark Pulse from Houndour - even at Naive nature, and deals a maximum of 87.50%. Meowth is a dangerous lead, but Gible has a chance of surviving Fake Out followed up by Bite and can strike back with Earthquake. Bulky leads like Bronzor give Gible a fairly risk free set up of Stealth Rock. Gible is by no means a suicide lead, it can also be conserved and then come back to haunt opposing teams as a highly-effective revenge killer late game.</p>

<p>If you are not using Gible as a lead, there are two options opened in the last slot and they both have different purposes. Stone Edge is a great move when you want to hit Flying-types for super effective damage without using Outrage and eventually get locked in. Hidden Power Ice adds a surprise value when you want to grab the OHKO on unsuspecting Gligar trying to come in on your beloved Earthquake or your Outrage. Dragon Claw is always another option if getting locked into Outrage is a big issue for you.</p>

<p>When playing Gible as a lead, take note on what you're up against because Gible cannot handle all the leads in Little Cup. Snover and Phanpy in particular can defeat Gible because they have Ice Shard, can OHKO Gible and has priority over all Gible's attacks. As such, packing a Bronzor of your own can help handle these threats and can provide Stealth Rock support at the same time, which Gible doesn't mind when trying to sweep late-game. Squirtle can work exceptionally well alongside Gible, because it can take Ice Shard from Phanpy and counteract with Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock or threaten it with a STAB Water-type move. From an offensive standpoint, Gible partners with Magby quite well because it helps by clearing the field of Steel-types, allowing Gible to sweep late-game.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Fire Blast
item: Salac Berry
nature: Naive
evs: 96 HP / 196 Atk / 36 SpA / 180 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gible's excellent Dragon / Ground / Fire coverage, coupled with Substitute can be really irritating as this set can potentially trouble unprepared teams, thanks to its ability, Sand Veil. While sandstorm is constantly brewing, Sand Veil becomes extremely dangerous because it grants him a way to dodge hits behind a Substitute.</p>

<p>The whole idea behind the set is to get behind Substitute and begin to dish out damage with your perfect type coverage. Despite Gible's terrible Defense- which makes it difficult to throw in a Substitute, there are several ways to slip this move. Gible can take advantage of its unique typing and switch in on locked in Fire- and Rock-type moves, or Gible can force a switch-out on Pokémon you outpace and advance by using Substitute. Another way is to predict status from the opponent, and using Substitute can easily block it off. The good thing about this set is that if your opponent decides to stay in and attempt to stop Gible from using Substitute, Sand Veil can kick in and the opponent can potentially miss. Thanks to Sand Veil, your opponent has roughly one out of five chances of missing which is enough tries to use Substitute and when your HP is reduced, Salac Berry kicks in and things can turn worse for the opponent. With Salac Berry's speed boost, Gible reaches 21 Speed, enough to outspeed any other non-speed boosted Pokémon in Little Cup.</p>

<p>Gible has two options in the second slot: Outrage can dish out good damage on physical walls with the cost of getting locked in, while Dragon Claw serves as a safer STAB move but in exchange of missing out crucial 2HKOs on certain walls. Earthquake can hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, so unlike the previous sets, Gible doesn't have to use prediction to hit incoming Rock- and Steel-types. Fire Blast scores a 3HKO on standard Bronzor even with Oran Berry activated.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set can be an effective mix set with max Attack, max Special Attack and 100 Speed, as it allows Gible to shred through walls with its impressive type coverage. For the set to function properly, Gible has to use Life Orb to get the OHKOs on Munchlax and Bronzor. Gible is, however, limited because it is very poor at taking attacks from special attackers like Misdreavus without any investment in Special Defense or HP. It is advised that you pack Munchlax to handle these special attackers and help Gible survive longer.</p>

<p>Snover is a big threat to your strategy because it has Snow Warning and Ice Shard to foil Gible's sweep. Snover needs to be taken out early in the match because it takes a huge load off Gible's back. Packing Magby help scare it away and can attempt to destroy Bronzor, which gives Gible a pretty hard time if it isn't behind a Substitute. For defensive purposes, Bronzor pairs up nicely when you want to take Ice Shard from Snover and 2HKO it with Gyro Ball.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gible doesn't have much but it can run a Choice Specs set to beat certain physical walls much quicker, but it is better off taking advantage of its superior Attack. Gible has Scary Face to help patch up its pathetic Speed, but its generally a waste of moveslot and Gible is more effective when taking advantage of its excellent type coverage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Preventing Gible from advancing its sweep is Snover, thanks to its ability Snow Warning and access to Ice Shard to outpace and OHKO a locked-in Gible. With Snow Warning, it cancels out its ability and in return Ice Shard will OHKO, even with Defense EVs. Snover can switch-in on Earthquake and force it to switch out for the most part.</p>

<p>Bronzor can counter Gible pretty well for the most part, because Gible has to rely on scoring a 3HKO with the shaky accuracy of Fire Blast. It can come in on Earthquake, Stone Edge, unboosted Outrage, and Hidden Power Ice with relative ease and can take it down with Gyro Ball or Earthquake.</p>
