[OVERVIEW]

<p>Slakoth is one of the worst Pokemon in Little Cup. Its stats are below average, and Truant completely removes any hope it has of doing anything. It is too slow to use a Choice Scarf, as even with maximum Speed it only reaches 19 Speed, which is well below the 21 needed to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon. Slakoth cannot even function in Trick Room because Truant wastes half of the Trick Room turns. Overall, Slakoth should never be used seriously, and is outright terrible.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Return
move 2: Pursuit
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Hammer Arm / Fire Punch
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 196 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 76 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is perhaps the best set that Slakoth can use. Return hits somewhat hard from a 24 Attack stat, and will do massive damage to frail sweepers trying to set up on Slakoth. Pursuit can OHKO Choice Scarf Gastly locked into Shadow Ball even if they decide not to switch. Ice Punch will net Slakoth an OHKO on non-physically defensive Gligar, while Hammer Arm and Fire Punch are used as coverage moves. Keep in mind that Slakoth should usually be switched out after an attack to minimize the drawbacks of Truant. Truant is also the reason why Choice Band is used instead of Life Orb here, as Slakoth will usually not be alive long enough (without a switch) to use a second attack.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are self-explanatory. Slakoth should not run Speed EVs, as it is so slow that even with maximum Speed and a Jolly nature, it cannot even outrun Machop. Double-Edge can be used over Return for additional power, but will diminish Slakoth's HP. Night Slash or Shadow Claw can be used over Pursuit to try to catch Ghost-types trying to switch in to take a Return, as Pursuit would hit the Pokemon switching out instead of the Ghost-type. As Slakoth needs to switch out after each attack, it requires a team with many immunities. A Ghost-type such as Gastly or Duskull is helpful to take the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Slakoth.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>ThunderPunch can be used to hit Water- and Flying-types super effectively, but since a neutral Return is stronger than a super effective ThunderPunch,and Ice Punch covers most Flying-types, the only Pokemon against which it has real use is Mantyke. A Choice Scarf set can be considered, but due to the fact that it is slow and weak, there are much better users of Choice Scarf. Sucker Punch is an interesting option to circumvent Slakoth's low Speed. Body Slam has a nice 30% chance of paralysis, which can actually allow Slakoth to outspeed other Pokemon. Finally, Yawn or Substitute can be used to try to preserve Slakoth during its Truant turn, but gives it no advantage once the opposing Pokemon switches or the Substitute is broken.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The easiest way to deal with Slakoth is just to attack it, especially with strong special attacks. Slakoth has poor defenses, and will be OHKOed by the attacks of many sweepers. Protect or Substitute will completely shut down Slakoth, as it will be able to do nothing during the Truant turn. Bulky Ghost- or Steel-types, such as Duskull, can wall Slakoth and use Will-O-Wisp to cripple it. Finally, predicting what move Slakoth will use and switching to a Pokemon that resists or is immune to that attack will automatically grant you a free turn. In the event that Slakoth somehow manages to take out one of your Pokemon, you will also have a free turn to set up.</p>
