[OVERVIEW]

<p>If cuteness was a stat, Mareep would have base 255. However, it isn't, and thus Mareep suffers. It could be called the worst Electric-type in Little Cup and few people would raise an eyebrow. The Screening Sheep can be effective, but there are still better dual screeners, such as Bronzor and Magnemite. Unless you really like Mareep, want to have a bunch of fun playing Pokémon, or have a theme going, use something else.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p> Mareep isn't the bulkiest thing alive, but it can take a hit or two. Using this set isn't hard, and can be pretty helpful to any team. All you do is switch in, set up Reflect and Light Screen, and switch to a setup sweeper. However, Mareep does have an extra trick up its...wool. Mareep can use Thunder Wave to stop sweepers in their tracks as long as they aren't named Glameow or have Ground-typing. This also helps compensate for Mareep's bad Speed. The problem is this set is countered by Ground-types, unless you are running Hidden Power Grass or Ice. That means Mareep is going to be luring in Ground-types like ants to honey, which hampers its ability to spread paralysis. Hidden Power Grass is great since it keeps Mareep from being walled by Ground-types and Chinchou. With Reflect and Hidden Power Ice, Mareep can lure in Gligar and take it out. Hidden Power Ice also gets excellent coverage with Discharge. Thunderbolt is the Mareep's main attacking option, although Mareep won't being doing much damage with its 13 Special Attack. Discharge works well with Hidden Power Grass due to the higher chance of paralyzing the opponent.</p>

<p>Oran Berry is the item of choice. It gives Mareep much more survivability, especially with the screens up. However, Light Clay is an option if you want the screens to last much longer; which can help with some sweepers that need two or three boosts to sweep effectively. Both Bold and Calm nature are effective, and can be changed to fit your needs. If you fear Pokémon like Dratini and other physical sweepers, use Bold. If Mantyke and other special attackers give you the chills, then run Calm. The EVs are pretty straight forward. Max HP gives Mareep a decent 25 HP, the same HP stat as Bronzor. The EVs in the defenses mean Mareep will have 14 Defense and 12 Special Defense with Bold nature, or 13 in each stat with a Calm nature.</p>

<p>Mareep has only one weakness: Ground. This means that Flying-types or Levitators are great teammates for Mareep. Setup sweepers are the best, since they can benefit the most from Reflect and Light Screen. Gligar, Drifloon, Mantyke, and Gastly are all great examples of Pokémon who can take advantage of Mareep's weakness. Rapid Spinners are also great teammates with Mareep, since it will be switching in a lot to set up screens. Squirtle is a great option, since Mareep can easily switch in on Electric-type attacks being used to take out the tiny turtle.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes a more offensive approach with Mareep. Discharge is Mareep's main STAB attack. While it is weaker than Thunderbolt, Discharge comes with a nifty 30% chance of paralyzing the foe, which helps with Mareep's poor Speed. Hidden Power Ice provides great coverage with Discharge, and is only resisted by Magnemite and Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass is useful for taking down Chinchou and Rock-types, such as Geodude. Power Gem is the only thing that separates the Mareep's attacking movepool from other Electric-types. Power Gem is useful for putting the hurt on Ice- and Bug-types, such as Snover and Venonat. Signal Beam hits Psychic-types, and hits Grass-types harder than Hidden Power Ice. As you can see, Mareep doesn't have much of a movepool to work with, but it has enough to make this set viable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given spread, Modest nature and Choice Specs, Mareep reaches a respectable 25 Special Attack. This set, unlike most Choice sweepers, is more focused on being able to take hits instead of outpacing them. With this spread, Mareep achieves 24 HP, 11 Defense and 12 Special Defense. While it isn't the bulkiest thing in the world, it is certainly enough to take a hit.</p>

<p>Flying-types and Levitators continue to be great partners with Mareep. They can switch in on Ground-type attacks and proceed to attack, set up, or use supporting moves. Taillow, Gligar, Drifloon, Gastly, and Doduo are all great examples. Mantyke is an especially good partner for Mareep, since Mareep can switch in on Electric-type moves. Also, this set is destroyed by Chinchou and Magnemite. This means Munchlax is a great team member, being able to Earthquake both of them while being able to survive their special offense. This set can also benefit from Trick Room support, since Mareep is so slow. Since Bronzor and Baltoy can easily come in on Ground-type moves and set up Trick Room, they are great teammates. Also, if you are using this in Trick Room, be sure to run Thunderbolt instead of Discharge and a Quiet nature; you don't want to paralyze your opponent in Trick Room.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mareep has very few other options at its disposal. Heal Bell can be used so Mareep can act as a cleric, but has trouble finding a moveslot. Cotton Spore can be used to lower Speed two stages, but Thunder Wave is generally better, since the Speed drop is permanent and has the chance to incapacitate the foe. Offensively, Mareep could use Rain Dance and Thunder, and it is a fairly decent option for setting up rain. Lastly, Mareep can surprise Chinchou and Magnemite with Hidden Power Ground, and you get decent coverage with Power Gem. Substitute is always useful for getting a free turn. Mareep does hit 14 Speed, but it goes down fairly quickly without EVs in HP and Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The Screening Sheep set is extremely easy to counter. Anything part Ground destroys it, unless it has Hidden Power Grass or Ice. Diglett, Gible, Gligar and Barboach are just a few examples of Pokémon who stop this thing. However, Mareep typically has the Ground-type immune partner in the wings, so be careful about using Earthquake. If Mareep is running Hidden Power Grass, Magnemite can stop it. Taunt also shuts it down completely, so Taunt Voltorb or Gligar do well against it. The Choice Specs set is beaten by prediction, like most Choice sets. If it uses Discharge, switch in Gligar, Gible, or any other Ground-type. Munchlax can easily switch in on Hidden Power Ice and hit back with super effective Earthquake. Gible, Diglett, and Aron can switch in on Power Gem and hit back with Earthquake as well. Aron can also switch in on Signal Beam. Also, Magnemite resists all four of those moves, and Chinchou can switch in on Discharge and Hidden Power Ice.</p>
