[Overview]

<p>Nincada is, in a nutshell, completely outclassed. Its offensive stats and Special Defense are weak, and its movepool is very, very shallow. Although it possesses a Ground typing, it doesn't even get Earthquake, a move that would improve it exponentially. What it does have, however, is a great Defense stat, in addition to resistances to Ground and Fighting, two very common attacking types. Even so, Nincada wishes it could be another Anorith, but the sad truth is, it doesn't even come close.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Nincada's typing and superb Base 90 Defense stat allow it to sponge physical attacks from a variety of Pokémon. Bug Bite is Nincada's primary means of attacking, allowing it to deal damage and possibly restore its health simultaneously. Toxic has the ability to hinder many Pokémon that this Nincada will switch into. Aerial Ace hits Fighting-types pretty hard, and the last slot boils down to preference; Hidden Power Ice is primarily for Gligar and Hippopotas, though it should be noted that they will also not enjoy Toxic, whereas Hidden Power Ground can potentially hit Croagunk for an OHKO, while Croagunk can only muster a 2HKO with Ice Punch in return. If using Hidden Power Ground, throw in an extra 4 EVs into Nincada's Special Defense so as to compensate for the IV loss.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because this set is supposed to stop physical attackers cold, major Special Defense investment is not necessary. Munchlax makes a good partner for this set, as it can easily take all special attacks that are aimed at Nincada. In addition, Nincada has defensive synergy with Munchlax, as it can take most Fighting-type attacks that are launched at Munchlax. Speaking of specially defensive partners, Mantyke has the highest Special Defense stat in the metagame, at a whopping base 120. Mantyke can sponge Fire-type attacks with ease, and, thanks to its Water Absorb ability, can even restore its own health when hit by a Water-type attack. In addition, Nincada takes nothing from the Electric-type attacks that threaten Mantyke.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Bug Bite / X-Scissor
move 2: Night Slash
move 3: Aerial Ace
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Metal Claw
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpA / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Nincada can reach 21 Speed at +1 with maximum Speed EVs and a positive nature, and the coverage it gets is just enough to merit a Choice Scarf set. Bug Bite allows Nincada to eat Oran Berries held by opposing Pokemon, but X-Scissor is Nincada's strongest physical STAB attack. Night Slash hits all Ghost-types hard, and Aerial Ace hits Fighting-types. Hidden Power Ice is actually a very viable option on Nincada, as it OHKOes Gligar after Stealth Rock. However, Metal Claw can hit Ice- and Rock-types for super effective damage. A Naive nature and 196 Speed EVs are essential for Nincada to hit 21 Speed with a Choice Scarf. 236 Attack EVs maximize Nincada's Attack, and 36 Special Attack EVs give Hidden Power Ice extra power. The remaining EVs are put into its Defense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this set cannot touch Bronzor at all. Even X-Scissor, Nincada's most powerful attack, can only do a maximum of 32%. Also, without a decent Ground-type attack, every Fire-type Pokémon can switch in and threaten Nincada with their STAB attacks.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As previously mentioned, this set is endlessly walled by Bronzor. Having Fire-type Pokémon or Magnemite on your team is therefore advised in order to take care of Bronzor. Pokémon with the ability Flash Fire, namely Houndour and Growlithe, easily beat any Fire-types that have switched into Nincada. Dig is Nincada's only Ground-type attack, and has decent Base Power, but doesn't warrant even a mention on this set as it guarantees opposing Flying-types and Levitators free switch ins. This set also likes Stealth Rock support, which allows Nincada to net a couple of KOs it otherwise wouldn't be able to get. Piplup is a decent lead that can set it up, and pairs well with Nincada.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Because Nincada's movepool is so limited, there really aren't many other options. There's Return, Nincada's most powerful attack outside of X-Scissor, but using it over any other attack would lose Nincada a lot of coverage. Hidden Power Fire can be used on the first set over Hidden Power Ice if you want to do more damage to Bronzor, but Nincada still won't be able to even muster a 3HKO (factoring in Oran Berry).</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bronzor is a surefire counter to Nincada. It takes pitiful damage from anything Nincada that can throw at it, and can hit back with Psychic or Hidden Power Ice. Mantyke resists Bug-type attacks, and threatens Nincada with a STAB super effective Hydro Pump or Surf. Tentacool is in the same boat as Mantyke, but also sports an immunity to Toxic. Finally, most Choice Scarf Pokemon that run special attacks, such as Chinchou, beat Nincada with ease.</p>
