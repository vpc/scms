[Overview]

<p>Larvitar is one of the more underrated Little Cup Pokémon. While many think of it to be in the shadow of other status abusers such as Taillow and Teddiursa, Larvitar can be a formidable physical sweeper with correct support. Although its weaknesses to common priority moves reduce its effectiveness, much like Tyranitar in OU, the little dinosaur can rip holes in unprepared teams with little difficulty.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Larvitar's claim to fame lies in its ability to boost both its Attack and Speed to phenomenal levels in just one turn. Rock Polish is the preferred option as it allows Larvitar to outspeed all Choice Scarf users who have 17 Speed or less while maintaining a respectable 25 Attack. Dragon Dance puts Larvitar at 21 Speed after one use, outrunning every non-boosted Pokémon in Little Cup, and also allows Larvitar to reach an astronomical Attack stat of 36. Earthquake, a very powerful move in Little Cup that also comes with STAB, makes an obvious choice on the moveset. However, choosing between Stone Edge and Rock Slide all depends on power and accuracy, though Stone Edge is generally the better option as Larvitar wants to deal as much damage as it can before getting KOed. Crunch makes for great filler, being able to hit the Ghost-types of Little Cup, while being your most effective move against Bronzor.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Toxic Orb does less damage than Flame Orb over the first two turns, equal damage on the third turn, and starts to do more damage on each subsequent turn after that. As Larvitar tends to stay in and sweep for as long as it can, Toxic Orb is generally less useful than Flame Orb.</p>

<p>Priority is the bane of Larvitar. Common priority users such as Croagunk, Carvanha, and Squirtle cut Larvitar's sweep short and should be dealt with before bringing Larvitar in. Mantyke in particular is extremely effective at removing the most common of the above, Croagunk, with Hidden Power Flying. Mantyke also has great synergy with Larvitar, possessing immunities to Water- and Ground-type attacks, while taking pitiful damage from most Grass-type attacks due to its impressive Special Defense. Mantyke can also punch holes in the opponent's physical walls, making Larvitar's sweep easier. A Croagunk of your own can also greatly help Larvitar in its sweep by absorbing Water- and Grass-type attacks, as well as finish off Pokémon who barely survive Larvitar's onslaught. Choice Scarf Magnemite can remove Bronzor from the game, who is never 2HKOed by Crunch through Oran Berry. Wynaut is a great teammate to Larvitar, as it provides the important set up turn with the help of Encore. Wynaut can also remove Choice Scarf users, which is helpful if you are using Dragon Dance instead of Rock Polish. Finally, dual screen support is appreciated, as it may allow Larvitar to set up two turns in a row, though finding time to set up may prove to be a challenge.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sadly, Larvitar does not have much of a movepool apart from what has been mentioned already. Outrage may be used for great neutral coverage, although the undesirable side effect discourages usage. Superpower hits Bronzor harder than any other move, but the Attack drop is usually not worth it. Larvitar can try and pull off a Curse set, but with the huge amount of weaknesses it possesses, Larvitar won't be staying around long enough to make full use of it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Larvitar's only true counter is Bronzor. Resistance to its STAB attacks alongside the ability to OHKO Larvitar with Gyro Ball solidify its place as a Larvitar counter. Besides Bronzor, priority users such as Croagunk and Carvanha can also check Larvitar with ease. Effectively, anything with a super effective priority move can be considered a decent check to the little dinosaur.</p>
