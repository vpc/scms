[Overview]

<p>With its rare ability to trap Steel-types, Magnezone can find a spot on just about any team. It boasts an excellent base 130 Special Attack stat, a great Electric / Steel typing (which grants a resistance to 13 of the 17 types), and useful moves, such as Thunderbolt, Flash Cannon, and Explosion. While Magnezone's Speed is less than average—even its predecessor, Magneton, is faster—it more than compensates with its reliability and power. If your team has trouble with Steel-types, such as Choice Band Scizor and Choice Scarf Jirachi, then there is no reason to not consider Magnezone for your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Magnezone's excellent defensive stats, typing, and unique ability help it come out on top against most Steel-type Pokemon. Substitute lets Magnezone evade status and get in another hit after it has knocked out the trapped Steel-type. Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Grass provide neutral coverage against everything bar Dragon- and Grass-types. Explosion can prove invaluable against stall teams, removing a Pokemon such as Blissey as it switches in. Magnet Rise gives Magnezone the upper hand against slower Steel-types, namely Metagross, and makes Magnezone even more of a threat to your opponent.</p>

<p>The EV spread provided allows Magnezone to outpace Pokemon of 229 Speed and below, most notably Adamant Scizor. 40 Attack EVs give Explosion that extra "oomph", but feel free to run a Timid nature and 40 HP EVs instead if you opt for Magnet Rise.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are plenty of other Hidden Power types you can consider, depending on what Pokémon cause your team the most trouble. Hidden Power Grass is generally the most consistent option since it hits most Ground-types, including Swampert, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is a guaranteed OHKO on the ubiquitous Scizor, as long as it is not holding an Occa Berry. Hidden Power Ice is a viable alternative which also hits Ground-types for super effective damage, yet at the same time, guarantees OHKOs against Dragonite and Flygon. Hidden Power Ground will OHKO Heatran and opposing Magnezone, although residual damage from Stealth Rock may be needed in the former's case. With a Modest nature, 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe is an alternate EV spread, allowing Magnezone to outpace minimum Speed Skarmory. Life Orb is viable as an item over Leftovers, but only with paralysis support. This is important because all of the Pokemon that Magnezone gains KOs against with a Life Orb are faster than Magnezone and can OHKO it with typical coverage or STAB moves.</p>

<p>Sweepers that enjoy having opposing Steel-types eliminated are generally good partners for Magnezone. Dragonite and other Dragon-types appreciate their STAB attacks being unresisted. Furthermore, the duo of Magnezone and an airborne Dragon-type resists all 17 types, a feat few other duos can boast. Gengar also appreciates a Magnezone on its side, and has immunities to two of Magnezone's weaknesses: Ground and Fighting. In addition, both Dragonite and Gengar benefit from Magnezone's ability to eliminate Choice Band Scizor, their most common check.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Magnezone can revenge kill numerous threats, such as Swords Dance Lucario and Scizor, and even a few non-Steel types, such as Life Orb Gengar. Thunderbolt is Magnezone's most powerful attack, quickly finishing off most weakened sweepers. The Hidden Power of your choice is for specific threats, such as Scizor and Dragonite, respectively. Flash Cannon is a useful secondary STAB which hits Tyranitar for super effective damage. Finally, Explosion is Magnezone's only hope of taking down Blissey.</p>

<p> With the given EVs (and Hidden Power Ice), Magnezone reaches a Speed of 360, which outpaces positively-natured base 110's and below. With a Naive nature and 4 Attack EVs, Explosion will do anywhere from 81.9% - 96.5% against 0/252 Calm Blissey, resulting in a likely KO after Stealth Rock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of Hidden Power types depends on what you want to revenge kill. Hidden Power Fire will OHKO all Scizor, while Hidden Power Ice will OHKO Dragonite and Flygon. For the fourth slot, Toxic is a viable option for wearing down common Magnezone switch-ins such as Swampert and Rotom-H.</p>

<p>Magnezone is prone to being set-up on or revenge killed after it has netted a kill, so team partners should focus on covering its major weaknesses. Celebi can switch into the Fighting- or Ground-type attacks delivered at Magnezone, while effectively countering bulky Water-type switch-ins as well. Speaking of bulky Water-types, Pokemon such as Gyarados and Suicune are great switch-ins against Fire-type attacks, and can handle the aforementioned Fighting- and Ground-type attacks fairly well. A great way to take advantage of this set is to carry Pokemon who tend to lure out Choiced Steel-types. Gengar and Dragonite can both accomplish this with great ease, and both Pokemon have excellent defensive synergy with Magnezone.</p>

ability: Magnet Pull
nature: Timid
evs: 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Magnezone is seldom thought of as a sweeper, it can take on the role quite effectively. The omnipresence of (Choiced) Steel-types in the OU metagame provides Magnezone with many opportunities to set up. Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice form the BoltBeam combo that hits every Pokemon in OU, bar Shedinja, opposing Magnezone, and Lanturn, for at least neutral damage. Charge Beam nabs Magnezone Special Attack boosts needed to pull off a sweep, while Substitute lets Magnezone avoid status effects and can safely lower its HP into Salac Berry's activation range.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given spread lands Magnezone at a Speed stat of 234, enough to outpace positive base 110's after Salac Berry's activation. With 28 HP EVs, Salac Berry will activate after three uses of Substitute. You can replace Thunderbolt with Flash Cannon, giving you coverage against Tyranitar, but leaving you walled by Water-types. On that note, Hidden Power Grass is a viable option over Hidden Power Ice, but it comes at the cost of being walled by Celebi.</p>

<p>Pairing Magnezone with Choiced Trick users, such as Rotom-A, is a reliable strategy, as Magnezone can come in on a Tricked Steel-Type, and set up while they are locked into a resisted attack. Rotom-A and Magnezone also cover each other's weaknesses quite nicely. Magnezone will also have trouble taking down Blissey and Swampert, both of whom are hampered by Toxic Spikes.</p>

move 2: Flash Cannon

move 4: Explosion
item: Choice Specs
ability: Magnet Pull
nature: Modest
evs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Magnezone can be equipped with Choice Specs to further boost its already massive Special Attack. Thunderbolt badly damages anything that doesn't resist it. Flash Cannon is your best weapon against Grass-types and Tyranitar, while Hidden Power Grass will deal severe damage to most Ground-types attempting to switch into Magnezone. Finally, Explosion allows Magnezone to go out with a bang when low on health, and also comes with the bonus of maiming Blissey and Snorlax switch-ins.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread turns Magnezone into a massive powerhouse, with Thunderbolt OHKOing Pokemon such as Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage. 84 Speed EVs are recommended to outpace minimum Speed Skarmory and Metagross, and the leftover HP EVs allow Magnezone to make better use of its defenses and typing. An alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to outpace Adamant Scizor and Metagross, while either a Mild or Hasty nature can be used if you want to boost Explosion's power.</p>

<p>Magnezone's subpar Speed is its main handicap, so it greatly appreciates paralysis support. Celebi is a great choice for spreading paralysis, since it resists Magnezone's Ground and Fighting weaknesses and can take on bulky Grounds easily. This set's greater emphasis on sweeping makes Tyranitar a good teammate; it can easily switch into Blissey, Heatran, and Rotom-A without Will-O-Wisp, which are the biggest immediate threats to Magnezone, and finish them off with Stone Edge, Crunch, or Pursuit.</p>

evs: 84 HP / 88 Atk / 252 SpA / 84 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set sacrifices a bit of the previous set's power in exchange for versatility. As always, Thunderbolt is Magnezone's invaluable STAB option, while Hidden Power Grass KOes most of the Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt. Flash Cannon hits Tyranitar and Celebi for super effective and neutral damage, respectively. Finally, Explosion will KO Calm Blissey 100% of the time, but be wary of Protect.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Magnet Rise is a viable option over Flash Cannon, which allows Magnezone to avoid Earthquakes from Ground-type switch-ins. Since Swampert is outsped regardless, Magnet Rise Magnezone is better off with Hidden Power Ice, to dispatch Gliscor and Flygon. Using Metal Sound just once allows Magnezone to 3HKO Calm Blissey should you be hesitant to simply Explode on her.</p>

<p>Without Hidden Power Ice, Magnezone is defenseless against Flygon and Gliscor. Gyarados is a great partner who can switch into predicted Earthquakes and threaten Flygon and Gliscor with Ice Fang or Waterfall. Magnezone and Gyarados also cover each other's weaknesses perfectly, leaving no type unresisted. A Gliscor of your own can Baton Pass Agility to Magnezone and make it a fearsome killing machine.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Thunderbolt / Discharge
move 4: Explosion
item: Light Clay
ability: Magnet Pull
nature: Relaxed
evs: 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The purpose of this set is to use Magnezone's unique typing and rare ability to set up dual screens for a setup sweeper or Baton Passer. The moveset is extremely straightforward; use both Reflect and Light Screen, then Explode to let a sweeper switch in for free. Thunderbolt or Discharge let Magnezone attack when needed.</p>

<p>With the given HP and Defense EVs, Magnezone will never be 2HKOed by an Adamant Jirachi's Fire Punch and will never be OHKOed by a standard Bronzong's Earthquake (even without Reflect). The Special Defense EVs allow Magnezone to never be OHKOed by a Timid Heatran's Fire Blast or Timid Gengar's Focus Blast (even without Light Screen).</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you are comfortable with having Explosion as Magnezone's only attack, there are several support options for the last slot. Thunder Wave helps circumvent Magnezone's low Speed, while Magnet Rise gives Magnezone the luxury of being able to set up on Pokemon such as Swampert and Hippowdon. Magnezone also has access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day. If you opt for one of the weather moves, Damp Rock or Heat Rock can be used over Light Clay.</p>

<p> The benefits of dual screens can be unmatched, especially on Baton Pass teams. With the increased defenses, your opponent will struggle to interrupt your chain, and you will be less pressured to try to sweep prematurely. Gliscor is a common member of Baton Pass-based teams and it also has great defensive synergy with Magnezone. Gliscor's relatively short list of weaknesses and access to both Swords Dance and Rock Polish makes it easy to set up and Baton Pass to a recipient, such as Metagross. Vaporeon can pass Wishes to Magnezone so it can repeat the process if needed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Discharge can be used on the Steel Killer set if you favor a higher chance of paralysis over power. Thunder Wave can be chosen over Explosion or Magnet Rise on just about any set, to paralyze faster switch-ins such as Heatran and Rotom-A. Rain Dance can be used on rain teams or if you wish to use Thunder as Magnezone's main STAB. Signal Beam can be used on Choice sets to hit Celebi for 4x super effective damage, but has little additional use. Magnezone can also make great use of a Rest + Sleep Talk set given its good defenses and excellent defensive typing.</p>

<p>Magnezone can function with many different Speed EV investments, depending on what you wish to outpace. The most significant are either 84 Speed EVs with a neutral nature, to outpace Skarmory, or 216 Speed EVs with a positive nature, to outspeed Adamant Scizor. Running a Speed stat of 190 lets Magnezone outpace minimum Speed Heatran, and 184 with a posititve nature is enough to beat Adamant Tyranitar. Finally, by running max Speed, you can be sure to outrun Adamant natured Metagross and Breloom.</p>

<p>Any set with Explosion can use additional Attack EVs to secure the kill on Blissey. With a Life Orb, you only need a 199 Attack stat to guarantee an OHKO, while a 224 Attack stat guarantees a KO without a Life Orb if Blissey has switched into Thunderbolt. A Mild or Hasty nature will also increase Explosion's damage output, but Magnezone is usually better off taking advantage of its decent defenses and unique typing.</p>

<p>There are many Hidden Power types that Magnezone can use well. Most sets give the option of choosing between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass. Hidden Power Ice gives coverage against Gliscor and Flygon, while Hidden Power Grass is useful mostly for Swampert and Rhyperior. Even if you choose Hidden Power Grass, Flash Cannon can still hit Flygon and Gliscor for decent damage, while using Hidden Power Ice will leave you more or less helpless against Swampert. Hidden Power Fire can be used on the Steel Killer and Choice Scarf sets, as it OHKOes both Scizor and Forretress. Hidden Power Ground can hit Electivire and Jolteon for super effective damage as well as severely damage Heatran and opposing Magnezone.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>With its high Special Defense, Blissey can easily switch in and sponge any of Magnezone's special attacks. Celebi and Snorlax can also switch in with impunity, and set up with Calm Mind and Curse, respectively. However, all three of the aforementioned Pokemon must be wary of Explosion. Rotom-A does not fear Explosion at all and can switch into Magnezone relatively easily, but must rely on Overheat to inflict any damage.</p>

<p>Gliscor, Flygon, or Swampert can counter Magnezone depending on which Hidden Power it uses, but only Swampert stands a chance against a Magnezone with Magnet Rise. Zapdos despises switching into Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice often, but Heat Wave can 2HKO almost all Magnezone. Heatran is the one Steel that Magnezone fears; Choice Scarf Heatran can easily OHKO it with Fire Blast or Earth Power. Tyranitar can switch into anything but Flash Cannon, and easily OHKO Magnezone with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Dugtrio can trap and OHKO any Magnezone that isn't protected by Magnet Rise or Shuca Berry. Opposing Magnezone also pose a threat, as they can trap Magnezone and KO with Hidden Power Fire or Ground. Electivire can switch into Magnezone's Electric attacks to activate Motor Drive and proceed to OHKO with Earthquake or 2HKO comfortably with Cross Chop or Flamethrower. Lanturn can absorb Electric attacks with Volt Absorb, and also resists all of Magnezone's commonly used special attacks, except Hidden Power Grass. Jolteon also has Volt Absorb, but unlike Lanturn, does not have any offensive choices against Magnezone, and is not quite as durable. Gardevoir can trap Magnezone with a Traced Magnet Pull and strike back with Focus Blast.</p>
