[Overview]

<p>While Electivire lacks the raw power and Speed of some other sweepers in today's metagame, he can make up for the latter through Motor Drive. Thanks to his usable attacking stats, he can perform the role of a mixed sweeper well. He is capable of doing lots of damage to teams with his vast movepool, which grants him excellent type coverage. In fact, Electivire can frequently hit every member of a team for super effective damage.</p>

<p>However, it is still important to note that Electivire's attacking prowess is average at best in comparison to the rest of OU; his lack of a strong, reliable physical STAB only compounds this issue. Even after a Motor Drive boost, he often finds his sweep cut short when faced with an opponent he can't hit hard enough. While Electivire does boast some of the best type coverage around, there remain plenty of bulky Pokemon he won't ever dream of beating.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
move 3: Cross Chop
move 4: Flamethrower
item: Expert Belt
nature: Mild
evs: 40 Atk / 252 SpA / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes use of Electivire's exceptional type coverage to beat his opponents. He might be easily walled at times, but Electivire's movepool is particularly broad, and the moves he has up his sleeve can provide such exceptional type coverage that you will constantly see the words "It's super effective!" on your screen. Electivire has a very hard time without the Speed boost from Motor Drive, however, as faster sweepers will effortlessly take him out, while slower, bulkier Pokemon aren't KOed even by super effective moves.</p>

<p>Even though Electivire's Special Attack is his lower offensive stat, Thunderbolt is preferred to ThunderPunch as the former will always OHKO Gyarados and Skarmory; the latter might not due to Intimidate and immense bulk, respectively. Hidden Power Ice takes out Gliscor, who will easily come in on any other move, while also completing the BoltBeam combo. As an alternative, Hidden Power Grass deals with the otherwise problematic Swampert, and can even OHKO him after a bit of prior damage. Cross Chop grants coverage on Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar, who wall him otherwise, while Flamethrower rounds out his coverage by hitting Steel- and Grass-types, including Scizor, Forretress, and Celebi.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs let him hit 280 Speed, which beats out neutral-natured Lucario before a boost and Choice Scarf Heatran after it. Special Attack is maximized due to the specially based nature of this set, while the rest are put into Attack so Cross Chop will hit harder. Earthquake is an option in the last slot, but it is generally an inferior option as Electivire won't be able to hit Scizor and Forretress as hard, or Bronzong at all. If taking this route, though, you can distribute the EVs more evenly between Attack and Special Attack.</p>

<p>It is important that Electivire comes in on an Electric-type move in order to gain the Speed boost. For this reason, lures of Electric-type attacks are highly recommended. Gyarados is a good partner due to his 4x weakness to Electric moves and immunity to Earthquake; in fact, almost all Flying-types, such as Togekiss and Skarmory, work in the same manner. Bulky Water-types can also assist Electivire in snatching Motor Drive boosts, but unlike Flying-types, they are not immune to Earthquake. Rotom-A is immune to Cross Chop and Earthquake, won't mind getting hit by Thunderbolt or either Hidden Power, and can cripple Electivire with Will-O-Wisp. Even though this set is not entirely physically based, he is still much less of a threat when burned. Heatran therefore makes a good partner, but keep in mind that Heatran shares Electivire's weakness to Ground-type attacks. Opposing Heatran can also be a threat to this set if it lacks Earthquake, as he can come in freely on Flamethrower and can take Cross Chop. Faster Ground-types, such as Choice Scarf Flygon, also pose a problem. Flying-types are the best way to deal with these, as they can set up on Choice-locked Earthquake. If Electivire lacks Hidden Power Grass, Swampert takes little to no damage from any of his attacks; a bulky Water-type of your own, such as Gyarados, can help wear Swampert down with Water-type moves. Grass-types such as Celebi also work well in taking down Swampert, but do not lure Electric-type attacks for Electivire to switch into.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: ThunderPunch
move 2: Ice Punch
move 3: Cross Chop
move 4: Earthquake / Fire Punch
item: Expert Belt / Life Orb
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on Electivire's more impressive Attack stat, along with his ability to hit opponents for super effective damage, to hopefully tear a hole in an opponent's team. The idea of this set is the same as its mixed counterpart: switch in on an Electric-type attack and begin sweeping. With ThunderPunch, Ice Punch, Cross Chop, and Earthquake, Electivire hits 13 out of the 17 elemental types in the game for super effective damage.</p>

<p>ThunderPunch is this set's physical STAB, and although it is much less threatening than Thunderbolt, it can still deal solid damage. Ice Punch is necessary to hit Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite. In the same vein as the first set, Cross Chop hits Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar, although the first two will be less likely to switch into a physically based set. Earthquake helps against opposing Electric- and Steel-types, especially Metagross, Heatran, and Jirachi; however, Fire Punch is a fine substitute in order to hit Scizor, Forretress, and Bronzong harder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs here are very straightforward and provide Electivire with the maximum physical sweeping potential, as well as enough Speed after a required Motor Drive boost. An Adamant nature is chosen as Electivire really needs the power boost, considering his weak physical STAB, but even with maximum Attack, Electivire still has trouble breaking through physically defensive Pokemon such as Celebi and Hippowdon, who will take little even from a super effective move. Expert Belt is recommended as Electivire's greatest draw is his super effective coverage. Life Orb can allow Electivire to hit even harder without the need to use super effective attacks, but the recoil often just makes him that much easier to revenge kill.</p>

<p>As this Electivire lacks Hidden Power Grass, he cannot touch Swampert; anything with high Defense or the ability to burn Electivire will be troublesome as well. Flying-types are again good partners, but Gyarados is much less effective as a teammate as he too is crippled by burn. Heatran makes an effective partner because it can score a Flash Fire boost from the opponent's Will-O-Wisp, scare off Rotom-A, and wreck opposing teams once Electivire has removed opposing Water-types.</p>

[SET]
name: Meditate 
move 1: Meditate
move 2: ThunderPunch
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Earthquake / Low Kick
item: Life Orb / Expert Belt
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Meditate is inferior in comparison to other stat-boosting moves, such as Swords Dance, it is Electivire's only way of increasing his stellar Attack stat. In conjunction with a Motor Drive boost and Life Orb, Electivire will have essentially 739 Attack and 433 Speed.</p>

<p>ThunderPunch pairs nicely with Ice Punch to complete the pseudo-BoltBeam combination that has great coverage on many OU threats, such as Dragonite and Gyarados, while Earthquake is generally the best option to hit Steel-types. Low Kick is recommended over Cross Chop on this set as the latter does not miss out on any notable KOs after a boost, and the higher accuracy of Low Kick naturally makes it the better choice.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs maximize Attack and Speed. Life Orb is generally the preferred item, otherwise, Pokemon whom Electivire cannot hit for super effective damage will cause more problems than they should. In addition, as this Electivire only has three attacking options, it loses out on some type coverage, which makes Expert Belt less effective.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is pretty much a necessity to allow Electivire to 2HKO Celebi and OHKO Metagross. It also provides Electivire with a chance to OHKO Zapdos, Suicune, and Skarmory, which is especially important as the latter will otherwise phaze Electivire out and remove his boosts. Bulky Ground-types such as Swampert and Hippowdon still pose a serious threat, especially because they have high Defense stats. For this reason, Gyarados can make an effective partner, as he can switch in on Earthquake, nullify phazing attempts with Taunt, and set up on the aforementioned Ground-types. </p>

<p>Along with Stealth Rock, Spikes and Toxic Spikes can also be helpful to Electivire's sweep. Forretress is generally reliable at laying entry hazards down, while also being able to Rapid Spin away entry hazards that severely limit Electivire's survivability. Rotom-A will once again have a field day against this set, so Blissey makes a good partner; she can spread Toxic, take a Will-O-Wisp, and pass Wish back to Electivire to give him a second chance to sweep.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Charge Beam can raise Electivire's decidedly average Special Attack, but Electivire generally can't survive for long enough to put it to good use. More importantly, Electivire is outclassed by Jolteon in this regard, as the latter has both more Speed and a higher Special Attack stat. Low Kick might sound like a good idea, but it is really only viable on the Meditate set, as it does not do enough damage to Blissey right off the bat. Toxic can cripple bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Swampert, but not only is Electivire usually unable to find enough room for it, these threats can also swiftly OHKO Electivire. Screech lowers the enemy's Defense by two stages and enables Electivire to hit it extremely hard; it further helps Electivire deal heavy damage to bulky tanks such as Hippowdon and Swampert. Thunder Wave can paralyze opponents and is generally unexpected on Electivire, so it might find use somewhere.</p>

<p>Above all, keep in mind that Electivire's main draw is his excellent movepool. For that reason, Choice items almost incapacitate him, as he will be unable to make full use of his exceptional type coverage. Furthermore, he will often be locked into a generally weak move that can be easily exploited by the opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Swampert has an easy time against Electivire that lack Hidden Power Grass, and will always be able to beat both of the physical sets. Other defensive Ground-types work in much the same manner, as they are almost always able to take Ice Punch and then easily OHKO Electivire with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Rotom-A takes very little from both ThunderPunch and Thunderbolt, is not hit for super effective damage by any of Electivire's common attacks, and can cripple Electivire by burning him. Bronzong and Forretress have no problem against physical sets that lack Fire Punch. Priority moves, such as those from Lucario or even Scizor, often cause trouble to a Life Orb-weakened Electivire. Finally, even the uncommon Dugtrio can switch in on a predicted Electric attack and remove Electivire with a powerful Earthquake.</p>
