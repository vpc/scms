[Overview]

<p>Dugtrio has not changed much since ADV; it is still one of the best revenge killers in the game, if not the best. However, there are many factors that have hampered Dugtrio's usefulness in the DPP metagame. Several Pokemon, most notably Tyranitar, Weavile, Scizor, and Metagross, now have access to a strong physical Pursuit, and as Dugtrio commonly uses a Choice item, it is often a sitting duck after it gets its kill. The aforementioned Pursuit users also give Dugtrio serious competition as far as revenge killing goes, as they have much higher Attack and much better bulk. Worse yet, there is an abundance of priority users, such as Scizor and Lucario, who can prey on Dugtrio's terrible defenses. Lastly, the prevalence of Trick and Choice Scarf has reduced the number of Pokemon that Dugtrio can reliably revenge kill. In fact, it is sometimes forced to use a Choice Scarf of its own, which leaves it with only mediocre Attack.</p>

<p>Despite these issues, Dugtrio's revenge killing ability can be a great asset for most teams in the fast-paced and offensive metagame. Teams that need specific threats, such as Tyranitar, Blissey, Heatran, Infernape and Tentacruel, removed can find Dugtrio's Arena Trap the perfect fit. Dugtrio makes a good addition on rain, sun, and hail teams for this reason alone, and is a surprisingly good counter to stall teams. Even just one surprise kill from Dugtrio can stop your opponent's sweep, or create an opening for a sweep of your own. While Dugtrio is helpful in this regard, you will need to be cautious.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dugtrio's usefulness is not limited to UU. In OU, its Earthquake ravages Magnezone and Heatran, as well as weakened Tyranitar, while Stone Edge nets important 2HKOs on uninvested Gyarados, Zapdos, and Dragonite. Priority Sucker Punch allows Dugtrio to beat the occasional Alakazam, which it can trap. Sucker Punch will also OHKO Gengar and do upwards of 86% to Azelf, but these two threats can easily switch out thanks to Levitate. Aerial Ace is the preferred option in the last slot as it is Dugtrio's only reliable means of revenge killing Heracross and Breloom. As neither is that common, however, Pursuit is also a viable option that can KO fleeing Azelf and Gengar. Night Slash can be used to hit bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types that commonly carry support moves to evade Sucker Punch, such as Celebi, Rotom-H, and Cresselia.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature and the given EVs enable Dugtrio to outspeed positive-natured base 115 Speed Pokemon, and thus revenge kill Pokemon such as Infernape, Choice Scarf Magnezone, and +1 Tyranitar. As the only benefit to maximizing Speed is to force a Speed tie with uncommon UU Pokemon, it is not recommended. An Adamant nature, however, maintains the ability to outrun positive base 100s, and allows Earthquake to 2HKO 252/252+ Blissey after Stealth Rock. Adamant Dugtrio's Earthquake also lands an OHKO on 252/0 Tyranitar, which Jolly Dugtrio manages to do only 53.85% of the time. Choice Band provides Dugtrio with enough power to get that crucial 2HKO on Blissey and OHKO on most Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. However, the locking effect of a Choice item leaves Dugtrio more vulnerable to Pursuit. This is less of a problem for Life Orb variants, whose attacks will still have enough power to finish off frailer foes, but Dugtrio will no longer be able to reliably 2HKO Blissey or OHKO Tyranitar even with Stealth Rock on the field.</p>

<p>Pursuit, from the likes of Tyranitar, Scizor, Weavile, Metagross, and Heracross, is arguably the biggest threat to Dugtrio. Unless you desperately need Dugtrio to KO a foe, it is best to first scout your opponent's team; these Pokemon will usually be revealed early if they carry Pursuit. Tyranitar, Metagross, and Heracross can be trapped after they KO an opponent, but Scizor is harder to remove thanks to Bullet Punch and U-turn. If Scizor doesn't use U-turn, however, Magnezone can trap it. Perhaps the most difficult to eliminate is Weavile. Choice variants can be trapped and picked off with Earthquake if locked into Pursuit, which is the only common attack of Weavile's that does not OHKO Dugtrio. Non-Choice Weavile, however, are problematic. Scizor and Forretress resist Weavile's STAB moves and can threaten to OHKO with Bullet Punch and Gyro Ball, respectively.</p>

<p>Be careful when switching Dugtrio in on Blissey. While Dugtrio can switch in for free on Thunder Wave, Ice Beam easily 2HKOes Dugtrio, and Toxic Blissey can stall Dugtrio until it faints of poison damage. It’s therefore a good idea to weaken opposing Blissey and find out her moveset before attempting to switch in. If a teammate manages to Trick Blissey a Choice item, Dugtrio will find it much easier to remove her.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Beyond the moves already listed, Dugtrio's physical movepool is barren. A lead set that uses Stealth Rock, Protect, and a Focus Sash has potential, but its use is limited in comparison to the listed set. Soft Sand is a viable choice as it can let Dugtrio fake a Choice item and net a surprise KO if Pokemon such as Mismagius try to set up on it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to Arena Trap, counters to Dugtrio do not strictly exist. However, after Dugtrio makes its kill, it can easily be eliminated by a revenge killer of your own thanks to its pitiful defenses. Scizor can easily OHKO it with Bullet Bunch; Choice Band Pursuit has a great chance to OHKO Dugtrio even if it should stay in. Similarly, Weavile can OHKO Dugtrio with Pursuit if it switches out or finish it off with Ice Punch if it stays in, but Pursuit will not OHKO a Dugtrio that stays in, and even Life Orb Dugtrio's Earthquake will OHKO Weavile after Stealth Rock. Tyranitar and Metagross too can trap Dugtrio with Pursuit if it is locked onto any attack besides Earthquake. As in UU, Porygon2 can Trace Arena Trap and KO it with Ice Beam. Your own Dugtrio can take out an opposing Dugtrio locked into Stone Edge. Finally, if any of your Pokemon can inflict a burn on Dugtrio, its damage output will be laughable.</p>
