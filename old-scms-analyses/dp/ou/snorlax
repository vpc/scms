[Overview]

<p>He's big, he's round, he's bulky, and he's back. Snorlax is among an elite group of Pokemon that have been OU for all four generations. Unfortunately for Snorlax, DPP has been the least favorable of them all towards him. With countless new offensive Pokemon added to the mix and items such as Life Orb boosting their damage output, Snorlax has a very difficult time keeping up. In addition to this, Snorlax's typing always has and always will leave a lot to be desired. With a STAB that is resisted by over one-third of the metagame, it's tough to see why you'd want to use Snorlax at all.</p>

<p>Despite the nearly crippling faults mentioned above, Snorlax has a niche unlike any other Pokemon. He is the most durable offensively-inclined special tank in the metagame. This unique niche allows Snorlax to come into many of the special attackers in the metagame with near-impunity and have his way with them. While Snorlax isn't going to be winning any Best Pokemon awards with his faults, because of his assets, it's hard to deny him his rightful place in OU amongst the big boys.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>What do you get when you combine rock-bottom Speed with high Attack and immense special bulk? You get the ideal Pokemon for a Curse set. Snorlax practically defined the use of Curse for sweeping in previous generations, and still carries the mantle admirably through DPP. The problem with Curse Snorlax these days is that everything else is so immensely powerful that even Snorlax's bulk isn't enough to save him from being ravaged. That aside, Curse Snorlax is still an immense threat and can set up against a surprisingly large chunk of the metagame.</p>

<p>Curse is the only thing about this Snorlax that's set in stone. Body Slam versus Return is the classic status over power argument. Return hits much harder than Body Slam, but paralysis helps Snorlax more, so Body Slam is recommended. For a coverage move, it really is about picking your poison. Earthquake will deal with Tyranitar and grounded Steel-types, namely Heatran. Crunch will deal with the pesky Ghost-type Pokemon that are immune to Normal-type moves, while Fire Punch is for Skarmory, Bronzong, and any other Steel-type vulnerable to it. In the last slot, you get to decide how you want your Snorlax to go out. Either Snorlax can use STAB Selfdestruct and go out with an explosive bang the likes of which made the dinosaurs extinct, or he can use Rest to heal up and try to continue the sweep later. Rest without Sleep Talk makes it easy for opposing sweepers to set up on Snorlax, so it's wise to either carry a cleric on your team or avoid using it until you've dealt with the opponent's sweepers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread may seem entirely arbitrary, but each bit of investment plays an important part in optimizing Snorlax's stats. 216 Special Defense EVs gives Snorlax a bonus point, and when combined with 188 HP EVs and a Careful nature prevents Snorlax from ever being 3HKOed by Choice Specs Jolteon's Thunderbolt. The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense to buffer that stat after a few Curse boosts. More Defense EVs can be used at the player's discretion, but having sufficient Special Defense to set up on special threats is important. Thick Fat is chosen as it gives Snorlax some pseudo-resistances to switch in on, and most importantly lets Snorlax set up on Heatran locked into Fire Blast. Leftovers goes without saying on Snorlax, adding to his durability and restoring a metric boatload of HP per turn.</p>

<p>Snorlax hates Fighting-type Pokemon above all others. Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-type attacks without consequence are excellent partners for Snorlax. Gyarados and Dragonite can both set up Dragon Dance against Infernape and Heracross locked into one of their STAB attacks. Zapdos and Rotom-A function more defensively, and will usually attack or cripple the Fighting-type right away. Most physical attackers will be very annoying to Snorlax during the early stages of his setup. For this reason, physically bulky partners like Skarmory or Forretress are good partners to consider. Both of them can lay down Spikes, which makes the switches Snorlax forces from special attackers that much more deadly. Lastly, without multiple Curse boosts, Snorlax is not going to be able to do much to Skarmory, Bronzong, Rotom-A, or Dusknoir. Heatran is a great response to both of those annoying Steel-types, and can even switch into the Will-O-Wisps from the Ghost-types for a Flash Fire boost. Strong Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, can eliminate the Ghost-types if they manage to avoid a burn.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Body Slam / Return
move 2: Pursuit / Selfdestruct
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Earthquake / Fire Punch
item: Choice Band
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Snorlax is a powerful Pokemon that forces a ton of switches. With a Choice Band, Snorlax can capitalize on his ability to wall special attackers and smash the switch-in for substantial damage. This is made even better by the fact that Snorlax can pack Pursuit and destroy the special sweepers that fail to break him when they run away. Starmie, Jolteon, Gengar, and Choice-locked Rotom-A all fall to Snorlax with appropriate prediction.</p>

<p>Body Slam is preferred here to support Snorlax with paralysis so that it might actually outspeed something. Return, with a Choice Band boost, deserves a mention for being immensely more powerful than Body Slam. In the next slot, you are forced to choose between two of the best moves Snorlax has for this set. Due to Egg move / move tutor illegalities, Pursuit cannot be used with Selfdestruct. Pursuit allows Snorlax to checkmate Starmie and offensive Rotom-A and maim Jolteon if he tries to switch out. Selfdestruct, however, pretty much obliterates anything that isn't immune to it. Even most physically defensive Skarmory are OHKOed by it after Stealth Rock damage. Crunch is a definite must for 2HKOing the Ghost-types that will try to switch into Snorlax's Normal-type attacks. In the last slot, Earthquake and Fire Punch are both good options. Earthquake destroys Heatran and hits Metagross and Jirachi the hardest of all options. Fire Punch, however, does respectable damage to both Bronzong and Skarmory.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Snorlax likes hitting hard and being able to take hits. 252 EVs are placed in Attack to maximize his damage output, and 252 EVs are put in Special Defense to facilitate beating the special threats he's going to constantly switch into. An Adamant nature is used to boost his damage output even further. Thick Fat is always a good ability to add to Snorlax's resistance palette.</p>

<p>When using Pursuit, pair this set with anything that enjoys having Starmie and friends removed. Infernape makes a particularly deadly force alongside Snorlax when Starmie is taken out of the picture. Snorlax still has issues with being easily revenge killed by Pokemon with powerful Fighting-type attacks. For this reason, Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragonite that can switch into them with some regularity are good partners. Even with coverage moves that hit Rotom-A and Skarmory, you're going to want to have another Pokemon to handle them. Heatran does this admirably and even absorbs Will-O-Wisp from defensive Rotom-A for a Flash Fire boost. Lastly, Spikes and Stealth Rock support will wear down common switch-ins rapidly, especially since Snorlax utterly walls most special attackers. Gliscor makes a very good choice for setting up Stealth Rock because he checks Lucario and other Fighting-type Pokemon fairly well.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Whirlwind
item: Leftovers
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Snorlax has just the right moves available to him to take advantage of his enormous bulk with a RestTalk set. Rest and Sleep Talk combine to give Snorlax some serious and much needed longevity. This Snorlax is effective at coming in on Pokemon that it effortlessly walls, forcing them out, and then shuffling the team further with Whirlwind. Whirlwind also doubles as a means to prevent a sleeping Snorlax from being setup fodder for Pokemon like Gyarados or Dragonite. Body Slam further deters opposing setup by threatening to paralyze anything it hits.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With maximum HP and Defense EV investment and an Impish nature, Snorlax has almost perfectly balanced defensive stats. This allows him to come in on an assortment of Pokemon and threaten them with paralysis and phazing. Snorlax doesn't have to run Whirlwind if that doesn't suit your team. Generally speaking, phazing is the way to go with this set considering how pitiful Snorlax's damage output is, but Crunch is viable as well for hurting Ghost-types. Thick Fat returns as the ability of choice for letting Snorlax check Heatran extremely well. If there were ever a set to run Immunity on, it's not this one. RestTalk Snorlax already handles status really well, so it's best to stick with the bonus resistances. A more specially bulky EV spread of 188 HP / 104 Def / 216 SpD with a Careful nature can be used to execute Snorlax's strategy more effectively against special attackers, but leaves him dangerously open to even weak physical attacks.</p>

<p>This is the Snorlax that you want to run with Stealth Rock and Spikes. Skarmory and Forretress both make excellent Spiking partners to this set. Forretress and Skarmory both tend to lure Heatran, which Snorlax can switch into as long as Heatran doesn't decide to Explode. Skarmory also lures Rotom-A and other Electric-type Pokemon like Zapdos that Snorlax can take advantage of. Choice Specs Jolteon will never 2HKO the listed spread, but can certainly 3HKO it. It's a wise idea to have secondary Pokemon with which to check those super-powered special attackers in case Snorlax falters or has taken previous damage. Gliscor is an excellent choice for such a Pokemon because he can set up Stealth Rock, is immune to Electric-type attacks, and resists the Fighting-type attacks that Snorlax will lure left and right.</p>

[SET]
name: Tank
move 1: Body Slam / Return
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Selfdestruct
item: Leftovers
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sometimes the best way to use Snorlax is to take advantage of both his offensive strength and bulkiness at the same time. While the Choice Band set focuses on checkmating frail special sweepers, this set is more about taking multiple hits over the course of a match and continually attacking as your opponent switches in their best checks.</p>

<p>Body Slam and Return both have their merits on this set. Body Slam's paralysis can be immensely helpful in both supporting the team and letting Snorlax actually outspeed something. Return, however, sacrifices the chance of paralysis in exchange for hitting that much harder. Crunch is used in the second slot for the Ghost-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into Snorlax's Normal-type STAB moves. Earthquake is a valuable move to have on this set for OHKOing Heatran and Magnezone while doing respectable damage to both Metagross and Jirachi. In the last slot, what could possibly be picked other than Selfdestruct? Selfdestruct is Snorlax's pitch at taking out one last Pokemon before going down. Fire Punch can be used in the last slot over Selfdestruct for the ability to OHKO Scizor and 2HKO Forretress, but let's face it, you're going to want to blow Snorlax up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since Snorlax is singularly attacking with this set, 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature make those attacks sting as much as possible. You'll also want to invest 252 EVs in Snorlax's Special Defense stat so that he can switch in and force out those special attackers that he's famous for checking. Leftovers boosts Snorlax's longevity substantially given his enormous HP stat. Thick Fat certainly isn't going to waste on this set, either, as Snorlax is a respectable check to Heatran with it.</p>

<p>Despite all of the investment and the Adamant nature, Snorlax is not winning any awards offensively with this set. Skarmory is a huge problem when he comes in and sets up on this Snorlax all day long. Physically defensive Zapdos makes a particularly effective check to Skarmory because it resists the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Snorlax and fries Skarmory with Thunderbolt. Zapdos also soundly beats Scizor and Forretress with Heat Wave, two other Pokemon that will happily take advantage of Snorlax if he's lacking Fire Punch. It's definitely important to pair this Snorlax with a good user of Stealth Rock to help him capitalize on the switches he forces. Gliscor is a great user of the move to consider because of his resistance palette that complements Snorlax so well.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Like most Normal-type Pokemon, Snorlax has an exceptionally diverse movepool with a lot of options. All of the special attacking options available to Snorlax, including Surf, Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, and Fire Blast, are pretty much worthless coming off of a pathetic base 65 Special Attack stat. It's always better to use Snorlax's physical options. Speaking of physical attacks, Snorlax has Ice Punch and ThunderPunch available to him. Against the Pokemon 4x weak to these moves, they are powerful, but against everything else, they're inferior to the listed options on each set. Snorlax also has Zen Headbutt, but there's really no reason to run it given that Snorlax can't outrun any of the Pokemon it might want to hit with the move.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Immunity is a good ability, Snorlax is typically using Selfdestruct to exit a battle or already taking advantage of Rest, which removes status. There is little reason to run Immunity on a Pokemon that plays like Snorlax, especially when Thick Fat allows Snorlax to check Heatran so effectively. However, if your team is particularly vulnerable to Toxic stalling and Snorlax isn't using Rest, you may elect to forgo Thick Fat for Immunity on Snorlax.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>All of the best responses to Snorlax are Pokemon with powerful Fighting-type attacks. Most, if not all, of these Pokemon hate being paralyzed though, so be mindful of switching into Body Slam recklessly. If they can get in safely, Infernape, Lucario, Machamp, and Heracross can all put Snorlax down in a jiffy. Strong and boosted physical attackers will also punch through Snorlax's defenses. With a Life Orb equipped, Pokemon like Metagross and Mamoswine can 2HKO Snorlax easily with their STAB attacks. Ghost-type Pokemon can switch into Snorlax's STAB attacks with ease and also generally pack Will-O-Wisp with which to burn Snorlax. A burned Snorlax is pretty much worthless offensively, so at that point you can proceed to switch in one of the Fighting-type Pokemon he hates facing. Lastly, there are a few Pokemon that can effortlessly wall Snorlax even if he attempts to set up. Skarmory can switch into even sets with Fire Punch, set up Spikes, and Roost off damage taken. Fire Punch boosted by either Curse or Choice Band is about the only thing Snorlax can do that actually stings Skarmory. Bronzong can come into Snorlax much like Skarmory, set up Stealth Rock, and then Explode if Snorlax tries to set up Curse. Forretress functions in a similar manner, but only if Snorlax lacks Fire Punch.</p>
