[Overview]

<p>Monstrous, both competitively and aesthetically, Tyranitar is easily one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the game, and for good reason. Its excellent stat spread gives it incredible versatility, allowing it to perform in nearly any role it wants. Choice Scarf sets make incredible trappers and revenge killers, while mixed and Choice Band sets pack incredible power and generally make stall weep. On top of that, Tyranitar can sweep with a Dragon Dance set. It's no slouch defensively as well, with 100/110/100 defenses bolstered by Sand Stream and its Rock typing.</p>

<p>That said, Tyranitar isn't without issues. Numerous weaknesses to common types make it tough to survive hits from many opponents, and the popularity of Scizor, its greatest nemesis, doesn't help. Despite these faults, Tyranitar is an excellent Pokemon, and easy to fit into nearly any type of team.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Pursuit
move 4: Earthquake / Superpower
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It may seem odd to use a Choice Scarf on such a slow Pokemon, but Tyranitar's great stat spread makes it a superior user of Choice Scarf. 61 base Speed gives it the ability to outspeed Pokemon with 115 base Speed and below, even with a positive nature, which allows it to outspeed notable foes such as Starmie, Azelf, and Gengar.</p>

<p>Stone Edge and Crunch serve as Tyranitar's main attacks, packing incredible power when backed by its outstanding Attack stat. However, the magic of this set lies in the speedy Pursuit, which gives Tyranitar the ability to put opponents into a checkmate position and eliminate them without fail. While Pursuit is guaranteed to OHKO all of the above Pokemon on the switch, it also does a number when they don't switch. For example: on a non-switch, 4 HP / 0 Def Gengar takes 78.2% - 92%, giving Tyranitar a significant chance to OHKO it after sandstorm and Stealth Rock, and guaranteeing the KO with 2 Stealth Rock switch-ins. Superpower and Earthquake round out the set, providing essential type coverage. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Lucario and Metagross, as well as striking opposing Tyranitar. However, Superpower allows Tyranitar to eliminate Blissey more effectively, as Bold Blissey is not 2HKOed by any of Scarf Tyranitar's moves, even Stone Edge.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are required to outspeed positive-natured base 115 Pokemon, and are crucial to this set's performance.</p>

<p>While Choice Scarf Tyranitar may be fast enough to outspeed many offensive opponents, it often finds itself lacking the power necessary to deal significant damage to defensive Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Swampert, and even Blissey. Because of this, it is important to support Tyranitar with Pokemon that are capable of punching holes in these defensive Pokemon. Infernape gets special mention here, as Choice Scarf Tyranitar is excellent at removing popular Infernape checks, such as Starmie and Gengar. Gliscor with Taunt and Toxic can also perform well, as it benefits from Tyranitar's Sand Stream (which activates Gliscor's Sand Veil ability) and easily dismantles defensive teams. Magnezone can trap Bronzong, Skarmory, and Forretress with its ability, Magnet Pull, as well as switch into Scizor and either absorb a U-turn or trap it on a Bullet Punch.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Pursuit
move 4: Aqua Tail / Earthquake
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a monstrous 134 base Attack and a powerful STAB Stone Edge, Choice Band Tyranitar is easily one of the most devastating Pokemon in OU. STAB Stone Edge coming off of Tyranitar's massive 604 Attack is enough to break through even the toughest of OU's defensive Pokemon. Combine this with 100/110/100 defenses and Sand Stream's Special Defense boost, and Choice Band Tyranitar is a Pokemon who can switch in with ease and, once in play, punish the opponent with its devastating power.</p>

<p>Stone Edge is one of the keys to this set's success. After the Choice Band boost, it scores OHKOs on a significant portion of the metagame even when hitting for neutral damage. It also packs enough power to easily 2HKO walls such as Skarmory and Forretress, making it an effective tool against stall. Crunch serves as an accurate secondary STAB, and provides neutral coverage on Pokemon that resist Stone Edge, such as Swampert, Bronzong, and Metagross. Pursuit allows Tyranitar to catch opponents fleeing from its powerful Stone Edge or Crunch and finish them off with ease. This helps Tyranitar eliminate specially-based Pokemon such as Zapdos, Jolteon, Starmie, and Choiced Rotom-A. The final slot provides Tyranitar with much-needed type coverage. Aqua Tail hits Hippowdon, Gliscor, and opposing Tyranitar hard, as well as providing neutral coverage and a reliable attack. Earthquake hits Metagross, Jirachi, and other Tyranitar, but is a dangerous move to be locked into. Finally, Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to OHKO Scizor and Forretress, as well as reliably 2HKOing Skarmory and Bronzong.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Running 72 Speed EVs outpaces 0 Speed Skarmory, allowing Tyranitar to 2HKO them with Stone Edge without being impeded by Roost. However, it is somewhat common for Skarmory to run Speed EVs to avoid this exact situation, so it may be beneficial to boost Tyranitar's Speed investment as well. After maximizing Attack, the remaining EVs are placed into HP for maximum bulk.</p>

<p>Due to its low Speed, this Tyranitar needs two main forms of support: firstly, it needs allies that can switch into its numerous weaknesses with ease, and secondly, it needs allies that give it numerous chances to switch in. Dragonite works extremely well alongside Tyranitar, absorbing Water, Ground, Bug, and Fighting attacks aimed at Tyranitar's rocky exterior. Meanwhile, Tyranitar can come in for free on the majority of Ice attacks aimed at Dragonite and proceed to Pursuit their users. Gyarados is also an effective partner, as it can perform identically to Dragonite alongside Tyranitar. Gliscor shares the Water weakness, but it can take the powerful Ground and Fighting attacks aimed at Tyranitar, and can also protect against Lucario, which sets up with ease on Tyranitar's STAB attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Fire Punch / Earthquake / Aqua Tail
item: Babiri Berry / Life Orb / Lum Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>After a Dragon Dance, Tyranitar has the power of the Choice Band set, speed of the Choice Scarf set, and the ability to change moves. On top of that, Tyranitar's excellent bulk and potential to pose an immediate threat makes it easy to set up a Dragon Dance.</p>

<p>Stone Edge serves as Tyranitar's main attack, packing excellent power. However, Rock Slide can be effective for two reasons. Firstly, it has enough power to OHKO Dragonite, Gyarados, Zapdos, and other common targets of Tyranitar's Rock-type STAB, but with 10% more accuracy than Stone Edge. Secondly, it has a very notable 30% flinch chance, which a Dragon Danced Tyranitar can use as a last-ditch effort to score some important 2HKOs. Crunch provides secondary STAB and reliable power. The last moveslot is used to provide important coverage. Fire Punch hits Steel-types hard as well as reliably OHKOing Scizor and 2HKOing Skarmory with 100% accuracy. Earthquake hits Metagross and Jirachi harder, while providing more power against opposing Tyranitar. Finally, Aqua Tail hits Gliscor, Hippowdon, and other Tyranitar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Babiri Berry allows Tyranitar to absorb Scizor's Bullet Punch and OHKO Scizor with Fire Punch. However, Life Orb can earn some crucial 2HKOs, such as a 2HKO on Swampert, who is unable to OHKO in response. Finally, Lum Berry can allow Tyranitar to set up on Rotom-A, which normally would be able to outspeed and burn Tyranitar, crippling it. It also protects against random paralysis from foes such as Celebi or ill luck from weak Thunderbolts or Flamethrowers that Tyranitar might switch into. Jolly nature allows Tyranitar to outspeed Azelf, Starmie, and anything below 115 base Speed with a positive nature.</p>

<p>Since this Tyranitar has issues with bulky Ground-types, such as Swampert and Hippowdon, it's a good idea to include Pokemon that can deal with them. Skarmory makes an excellent partner for Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as it can freely switch in on Tyranitar's counters and set up Spikes, which can then make it easier for Tyranitar to score OHKOs on opponents such as Metagross and Jirachi. Magnezone can also be effective, especially when running Life Orb, as it can eliminate choiced Metagross, Jirachi, and Scizor for your team. Choice Band Gyarados can also aid Tyranitar's sweep, as it can lure in and weaken or KO many Pokemon that give Tyranitar problems, such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Choice Scarf Rotom with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[SET]
name: Lure
move 1: Stone Edge / Crunch
move 2: Pursuit
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Flamethrower / Fire Blast / Ice Beam
item: Babiri Berry / Expert Belt
nature: Hasty
evs: 252 Atk / 16 SpA / 240 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is meant to bait out and eliminate many of Tyranitar's top counters. Since the types of Pokemon used to check Tyranitar are rather predictable, this Tyranitar can bluff a Choice Scarf and proceed to OHKO or heavily damage whatever comes in on the next turn.</p>

<p>Stone Edge and Crunch are basic STAB moves for Tyranitar, and choosing between them is a matter of choosing what you want to hit. Pursuit is used in tandem with other moves to play mind games with the opponent. For example: A popular tactic with Gengar is to use Protect as Tyranitar uses its first move, and then either attack on the Pursuit that fails to KO or flee from the Crunch. With this Tyranitar, you can fake out the Gengar user by choosing Crunch first, then use Pursuit as it attempts to get away scot-free. Blissey suffers the same fate, as it can easily absorb weak Pursuits, but falls to Superpower.</p>

<p>The last move serves to deter Steel-types. Lucario sets up for free on both of Tyranitar's STAB moves, but Flamethrower will often catch it attempting to Swords Dance on a predicted switch. Fire Blast has less accuracy and reliability, but it allows Tyranitar to 2HKO Specially Defensive Skarmory without Expert Belt. If using Expert Belt, Flamethrower is always the better option. Ice Beam can be used to hit Gliscor and Hippowdon, two common Tyranitar counters, but misses out on Scizor and Skarmory.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Babiri Berry is used to prevent Scizor from OHKOing Tyranitar with Bullet Punch. This means that unless Scizor is running a Scarf set, Tyranitar will always be able to outspeed and OHKO it with Flamethrower or Fire Blast. If using Ice Beam, Expert Belt is always the superior option, as Tyranitar is no longer able to beat Scizor. The EVs are fairly simple. 240 Spe with a Hasty nature allows Tyranitar to outspeed Adamant Breloom and anything below it, such as Adamant Scizor or Metagross. The rest are dumped into Attack, with the leftovers in Special Attack.</p>

<p>Since this set is designed to lure in and eliminate Tyranitar's top counters, it works extremely well with any Pokemon that shares counters with Tyranitar. Aerodactyl is one such Pokemon, as it benefits greatly from the removal of opposing Scizor. Aerodactyl also happens to benefit from Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability, making it much easier to switch into foes such as Heatran. This Tyranitar can also use both Crunch and Pursuit to surprise Gengar, and if it can also take out Gliscor, it makes it significantly easier for Lucario and other Fighting-types to sweep.</p>

<p>On the special side, Celebi and Shaymin work very well with this Tyranitar set. As with Lucario, Gengar can prove troublesome for offensive Grass-types, and Protect variants switching out expecting a Crunch can be eliminated by a surprise Pursuit. This Tyranitar also eliminates common Steel-types, such as Skarmory and Scizor, which have a quad-resistance to Grass and carry super effective Brave Bird and U-turn respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: TyraniBoah (SubPunch)
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Dark Pulse / Crunch
move 4: Flamethrower / Ice Beam / Thunderbolt
item: Leftovers
nature: Quiet
evs: 252 HP / 52 Atk / 176 SpA / 28 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Once the pinnacle of stallbreaking power, TyraniBoah is a legendary set capable of making even the fiercest stall teams shudder. Tyranitar has the perfect combination of bulk, type coverage, and power to punish stall teams that allow it to set up, and with Blissey being such an integral part of stall, it's hard not to let it get set up.</p>

<p>Boah, as it is commonly called, is fairly simple to use. Bring it in on something that can't threaten it, set up a Substitute, and prepare to wreak havoc. With 404 HP, Tyranitar can set up 101 HP Substitutes, preventing Blissey from breaking them with one Seismic Toss. Once a Substitute is up, Tyranitar can start firing off powerful Focus Punches. Dark Pulse and Crunch both provide basic STAB- Dark Pulse is better due to its ability to hit physical walls that Tyranitar otherwise wouldn't be able to hit. However, Crunch is effective, as even with 176 EVs and a boosting nature, Tyranitar's Attack is still superior to its Special Attack. The fourth move allows Tyranitar to take on specific threats. Flamethrower and Thunderbolt both hit Skarmory, with the former also being effective against Scizor, Metagross, Bronzong, and Jirachi, and the latter being effective against Suicune and Vaporeon. Ice Beam's main purpose is to hit Hippowdon, though it can also catch Dragonite and Flygon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Boah's EVs are fairly specific. 252 HP allows for the creation of 101 HP Substitutes, making setting up on Blissey a cinch. 28 Speed EVs are required to out-speed 4 Speed Blissey (the most common type), even after the nature drop. You may shift 4 of those Speed EVs to Attack if you please, but the miniscule gain you would get is far outweighed by the possibility of dispatching opposing Blissey without taking damage the same turn. 176 Special Attack EVs and a boosting nature allows Tyranitar to 2HKO Specially Defensive Skarmory 100% of the time with Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, while also allowing it to 2HKO Hippowdon with Ice Beam. The rest of the EVs are dropped into Attack, to boost Focus Punch. It may be a good idea to shift a few EVs from Attack into Speed to ensure Tyranitar is faster than Blissey and Machamp who invest slightly in Speed.</p>

<p>The best way to support this set is to give it plenty of ways to switch in and do its job. Any time Blissey is out, Tyranitar can come in and set up on it. As such, pairing this Tyranitar with powerful special attackers such as Shaymin, Heatran, or Starmie can make it easy for Tyranitar to wreak havoc on Blissey. Additionally, pairing Tyranitar with Pokemon that are capable of sweeping once key physical walls are weakened works well, since this Tyranitar can lure in and eliminate foes such as Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Swampert.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk / Fire Punch
item: Leftovers
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Between STAB Crunch, excellent defensive stats, and the Special Defense boost from sandstorm, Tyranitar makes an excellent Curse user in the OU metagame. The set is pretty self-explanatory. Curse up for a while, using RestTalk to heal off any damage or status, then eventually sweep with an incredibly powerful STAB Crunch. This works especially well if Tyranitar is the last Pokemon, as then it cannot be forced out by Pokemon such as Skarmory, which resist Crunch and can Whirlwind Tyranitar out. Fire Punch can be used over Sleep Talk, as it deals solid damage to Skarmory and Scizor, who may not OHKO Tyranitar after a Curse due to Tyranitar's solid defenses. However, it renders Tyranitar helpless while sleeping, so be careful when using Tyranitar without Sleep Talk.</p>

<p>The EVs are meant to build on Tyranitar's solid Special Defense stat, making it incredibly difficult to eliminate after multiple Curses. It is not necessary to invest in Tyranitar's Attack, because Tyranitar has 304 Attack before any investment, meaning that after a couple of Curses it can still hit incredibly hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Payback can be used over Crunch, as when Tyranitar goes last it has 25% more power. However, Payback has 33% less PP than Crunch, which can cause problems in a longer match. On top of this, Crunch has a number of advantages. First, in a last Pokemon situation, Skarmory can still use Whirlwind to PP Stall Tyranitar and reduce Payback's Base Power to 50. Second, a Defense drop from Crunch can mean all the difference in a drawn out fight against an opposing Pokemon with recovery.</p>

<p>This Tyranitar mainly fears Pokemon such as Infernape, Lucario, Metagross, Jirachi, and Scizor, which can switch in on Curse and deal massive damage with their STAB attacks, even after the defense boost. Because of this, it is important to pack Pokemon that can eliminate these troublesome foes before attempting to set up with Tyranitar. Choice Scarf Magnezone can trap and eliminate Lucario, Jirachi, and Scizor, as well as dealing solid damage to Metagross, and it can outspeed Infernape and force it out of play. Gliscor can switch into Scizor, Lucario, and physical Infernape with impunity and scare them out with its STAB Earthquake. Gyarados can easily switch into all of these threats, softening the blow with Intimidate and resisting their STABs, but must be wary of ThunderPunch from Jirachi and Infernape, as well as the rare Stone Edge from Lucario.</p>

<p>Bulky Phazers also threaten this set, especially Skarmory. Again, Magnezone can trap and eliminate Leftovers variants of Skarmory, and at the very least force it out and prevent it from using Roost. Suicune can also be troublesome, as it can either Roar out Tyranitar or simply Calm Mind and KO Tyranitar with a boosted Surf. Shaymin and Celebi make excellent partners for Tyranitar, as they can lure out Fire-type attacks for it to set up on, as well as take powerful Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks for Tyranitar. Celebi can also sponge Fighting-type attacks aimed at Tyranitar.</p>

[SET]

evs: 56 Atk / 252 SpA / 200 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike the BaitTar listed earlier, which is used to bluff a Choiced set in order to fool Tyranitar's offensive checks, this specially-based set focuses more on punching holes in the physically defensive cores of opponents. Instead trying to feign a Choice set, this set depends on prediction to attempt to catch one of Tyranitar's counters as it switches in.</p>

<p>Flamethrower is the primary attack, given how often Steel-types, such as Skarmory, Metagross, and Forretress switch into Tyranitar. Ice Beam handily disposes of Hippowdon, Gliscor, Dragonite, and Flygon attempting to switch into a weak physical attack or a resisted attack. The third slot is for coverage. Dark Pulse hits Rotom-A, Gengar, and the like, as well as having solid neutral coverage alongside the other two moves. However, Crunch can be used to bluff a Choice Scarf set and potentially ease prediction against Steel-types such as Skarmory. Finally, Thunderbolt allows Tyranitar to hit Vaporeon and Suicune. For the last slot, Superpower can be used to hit Heatran, opposing Tyranitar, and most notably Blissey, which walls the rest of the set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Scizor. Special Attack is maximized so that Tyranitar deals as much damage to physical walls as possible. The rest of the EVs are dropped into Attack, in order to beef up Superpower (and Crunch, if you opt to use it). Transferring a few Attack EVs into Speed can help Tyranitar outpace other Pokemon who are also aiming to be faster than Scizor. If you feel as though Tyranitar's special attacks aren't hitting hard enough, consider running a Rash nature, a Life Orb, and Fire Blast to ensure Steel-types are brutally punished for switching in.</p>

<p>Like with the TyraniBoah set, this Tyranitar doesn't need much defensive support. Instead, it looks for good opportunities to switch in. Notably, if running Dark Pulse, this Tyranitar can come in on Rotom-A, virtually ignore a burn from Will-O-Wisp, and eliminate it with a powerful STAB attack. Because of this, allies such as Metagross and Scizor, which benefit greatly from the removal of Rotom-A, Skarmory, and other physical walls, can take advantage of Tyranitar's wallbreaking prowess. Special attackers can also do the same–Shaymin works especially well, as it can lure out Fire-type attacks for Tyranitar to switch into, while absorbing Ground-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at Tyranitar. It also benefits greatly from Skarmory's death, as it performs far better once the opponent's Pokemon that 4x resist Grass-type moves are defeated.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are a couple of options that aren't listed in the main sets, but are entirely viable. Rock Slide has more accuracy than Stone Edge, but 25% less power, often making it a lesser option. While the Choice Scarf set is primarily built for using physical attacks, it's possible to swap some of its physical attacks for special attacks. Most notably, Earthquake / Superpower and Pursuit can be swapped for Fire Blast and Ice Beam respectively, allowing Tyranitar to reliably revenge kill things that it normally wouldn't be able to, such as Gliscor, and also 2HKO Skarmory, which is usually more than comfortable switching into anything ScarfTar would normally pack.</p>

<p>Tyranitar is more than capable of using its massive bulk for a defensive set. 100 / 110 / (154) defenses are among the best in the entire metagame, and with a little investment, Tyranitar can be incredibly hard to break on the special side. However, there's no "one spread" that's best for this purpose, so really, using defensive Tyranitar comes down to seeing what you need it to do and then giving it a spread that complements that. For supportive sets, Tyranitar can also make use of its fairly solid utility movepool, which includes Roar, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave.</p>

<p>Tyranitar can also make use of a Choice Specs set. However, Tyranitar benefits greatly from the versatility that its movepool provides, and as such, it is much more effective when using an item that capitalizes on that versatility, such as Expert Belt or Life Orb. Still, Choice Specs provides potentially massive power, and the results are extremely rewarding when you predict correctly.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There are a couple Pokemon in OU that Tyranitar has a tough time hurting. Swampert is the most notable, as it resists Tyranitar's powerful Stone Edge, takes no more than ~40% from Crunch, and is neutral or better to any other attack that Tyranitar would carry. It can also retaliate with a STAB Surf or Earthquake, both of which are super effective against Tyranitar. Machamp is another notable counter to Tyranitar, as it can shrug off both of Tyranitar's powerful STABs and ravage it with a powerful 4x effective DynamicPunch. Hippowdon performs extremely similarly to Swampert, except it is susceptible to Ice Beam from mixed or special sets. Finally, Breloom is probably one of the best counters to Tyranitar in the game. It resists everything that the common Tyranitar uses outside of Superpower or possibly Fire Punch, and it can use Tyranitar as setup fodder.</p>

<p>When dealing with Choice Scarf Tyranitar, options open up somewhat. Skarmory can switch into nearly any attack that Choice Scarf Tyranitar can use and proceed to lay down Spikes, significantly shortening Tyranitar's reign of terror. Blissey actually becomes a viable way to deal with Tyranitar, as outside of an untimely critical hit or a predicted Superpower, Tyranitar is unable to 2HKO Bold variants of Blissey. Forretress can perform similarly to Skarmory, except it trades the ability to recover reliably for the ability to take advantage of Tyranitar and Rapid Spin away hazards. Defensive variants of Rotom-A may not be able to switch in reliably, but they can survive an attack from Tyranitar and burn it with Will-O-Wisp, crippling it for the rest of the match.</p>

<p>Since the most common variants of Tyranitar are Choiced, it's easy to set up on its attacks with Pokemon that resist its STABs. Lucario has the advantage of being able to switch into both Stone Edge and Crunch with a 4x resistance, taking minimal damage despite its frailty. However, variants of Lucario who lack Bullet Punch or Agility should be wary, as even though Tyranitar may be setup fodder, it can later come in and revenge kill Lucario, who cannot respond due to Tyranitar's resistance to Normal-type attacks. However, Bullet Punch and Agility variants need not fear Tyranitar's return, as they are more than capable of eliminating a Scarfed Tyranitar.</p>
