[Overview]

<p>Porygon-Z was vastly over-hyped in the early stages of the 4th generation, claiming to be the only Pokemon that could OHKO Blissey with a special attack after just one turn of set-up. However, it soon fell into obscurity because of its average Speed and lack of resistances. With a couple of new move tutor attacks and some newly discovered sets, it is once more worth looking at for a slot on your team. Boasting the highest non-uber Special Attack in the game and a 160 Base Power Tri Attack (factoring in Adaptability and STAB), Porygon-Z is a potent addition to any team that can be tailored to its needs; it can 2HKO any Pokemon in the game after one Nasty Plot boost.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Choice Specs equipped, Porygon-Z's Special Attack stat goes through the roof, reaching a whopping 607. Coupled with a 160 BP Tri Attack or a +1 Special Attack boost, it can mow down almost anything not named Blissey. Dark Pulse tears into any Ghost-type Pokemon, OHKOing all of them except Dusknoir and Spiritomb. Hidden Power Ground, boosted by Choice Specs, 2HKOes 4/0 Tyranitar with Stealth Rock on the field and hits all the Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon that resist Tri Attack hard. If you plan on running a Timid nature, Hidden Power Fighting may be used instead, as it gives the added bonus of OHKOing 4/0 Tyranitar.</p>

<p>Though it may be tempting to run Hyper Beam on this set just for the power it provides, it's nearly always a bad choice. In today's metagame, it only takes one turn for many of the top sweepers, such as Lucario, to set up and then OHKO you and possibly the rest of your team—and that's only if they don't just kill you outright while you're recharging! Tri Attack provides a much more reliable STAB move and is many times more forgiving if you fail to predict accurately.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Specs Tri Attack 2HKOes both Lucario and 252 HP / 0 SpD Scizor with Stealth Rock, and can even 2HKO 252 HP / 0 SpD Metagross. Blissey is really the only true counter to this set, and she is easily dealt with by strong physically oriented Pokemon that don't mind being hit by status moves, such as Metagross. Since Choice Scarf Pokemon are easily able to revenge kill Porygon-Z, Metagross is also able to help out by beating them down with a priority Bullet Punch, and can take their hits without much trouble.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock, although never necessary, gives a huge boost to Porygon-Z's sweeping ability. Spikes are a plus, as are Toxic Spikes, but the latter won't make too big of a difference due to Porygon-Z's frailty—it usually won't live long enough to take advantage of them, and most of its counters don't mind Toxic Spikes, either. Because of its typing—a double-edged sword to Porygon-Z—it is hurt by all forms of passive damage, including weather conditions, status, and entry hazards. Thus, it is of utmost importance to be able to set up and deal as much damage as quickly as possible. The best way to do this is to switch in after one of your Pokemon has been KOed, preferably on something you know will switch out, such as a Gengar locked into Shadow Ball.</p>

<p>Since Porygon-Z's main counters are Pokemon with priority moves, Pokemon that outspeed it, and Blissey, it's relatively simple to find teammates for it. RestTalk Gyarados beats out most of Porygon-Z's counters and doesn't mind status or switching in to take a hit. Magnezone, especially Choice Scarf variations, helps deal with Scizor and Lucario, as well as many of the Pokemon that naturally outspeed Porygon-Z; it can even Explode on Blissey. Although not as useful as it used to be, Dugtrio can guarantee a kill on all Blissey and Metagross—that is, as long as it survives the likely Bullet Punch.</p>

<p>While Porygon-Z's Normal typing provides a ridiculously powerful STAB move in Tri Attack, it's not that great defensively. Even though Porygon-Z only has one weakness, it has somewhat low defenses, so you will definitely not want to be switching Porygon-Z in to take hits. Defensive Psychics like Uxie don't mind switching in on Close Combats or other Fighting-type moves at all. They also provide Porygon-Z with dual screens and paralysis support, aiding it in its attempt to sweep. However, they must watch out for Scizor, as a Choice Banded U-turn will make heads roll. Dragonite or Heatran is commonly paired with Scizor, Blissey, and Lucario in many teams, so it's important to be able to handle these threats as well. Vaporeon can handle most of the above Pokemon, as it has good enough defenses to sponge hits, and can offer team support through pHazing or Wish support. Swampert with Earthquake and Avalanche also fares well against Heatran and Dragonite and is a very bulky Pokemon overall. In addition, it's also a great user of Stealth Rock, which Porygon-Z needs to get certain OHKOs, and Roar.</p>

<p>Because Porygon-Z is so frail, it's important to scout out your opponent's team before taking a chance at a sweep. Using versatile U-turners, such as Scizor and Scarfed Flygon, allows you to get an idea of your opponent's team and battling style. Bulky phazers, such as Swampert and Skarmory, can shuffle around the enemy Pokemon, and the extra damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes that these Pokemon usually lay out is an added bonus. When using Porygon-Z, you have to remember that it's a glass cannon; it can hit extremely hard, but you must play it extremely carefully. One wrong move can cost you the sweep, and possibly the game.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Agility trades the power of Nasty Plot for much-needed Speed. Offensive teams may struggle to keep up. At +2 Speed, even Choice Scarf Flygon is outsped and taken out by Ice Beam. Hidden Power Ground deals a hefty 65% minimum to Choice Scarf Tyranitar with a Download boost, so with residual damage it should also be taken care of. The main reasons to use Hidden Power Ground, however, are Heatan and Magnezone. Hidden Power Fire is a lesser alternative, which gives you the power to OHKO Scizor as well as Skarmory, while 2HKOing Bronzong. If you know a Scizor is going to switch in, you can use it before Porygon-Z boosts with Agility to avoid Bullet Punch.</p>

<p>The EVs guarantee Porygon-Z after an Agility to be faster than 100s holding a Choice Scarf. Special Attack is maxed and the rest of the EVs are put into Hit Points. Scizor's Bullet Punch will do 74% maximum to Porygon-Z with the given EVs, but will still KO after Stealth Rock and two turns of Life Orb damage. To avoid being knocked out by Life Orb damage, you may opt to give this digital duck a Lum Berry or even Leftovers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With Hidden Power Ground as your choice, Scizor and Bronzong will prove very problematic. Gyro Ball's power will be boosted to max after an Agility, making sure you don't survive more than two hits. Magnezone combats both of these Pokemon, but needs Magnet Rise to effectively handle Bronzong. Heatran also counters these Pokemon well if you can avoid switching in on Superpower or Earthquake. Tyranitar with Flamethrower will often lure both of these Pokemon; it will OHKO Scizor and 3HKO Bronzong. Stealth Rock is extremely important when using this Porygon-Z, as without it Porygon-Z will miss possible KOs on Tyranitar, Skarmory, etc. Swampert is one of the most reliable users of Stealth Rock and also counters Tyranitar.</p>

<p>Download is the chosen ability because if you should get the boost, Tri Attack will become more powerful than if you had Adaptability. It also boosts the power of your other moves, putting the likes of Tyranitar, Rotom-A, and Skarmory into KO range. The majority of the metagame will give you the boost, making it the superior ability on this particular set.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Once the flagship Porygon-Z set, the Nasty Plot sweeper has become a lot less useful due to Scizor and the ubiquity of Choice Scarf Pokemon. It still wields fearsome power, and can sweep an unprepared team. It's very simple to use and can 2HKO any Pokemon in the entire game after just one boost. Like on every other set, Tri Attack is Porygon-Z's most reliable STAB attack, while Dark Pulse hits Ghost-types, and Hidden Power Fighting hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. The biggest letdown is Porygon-Z's middling Speed. Base 90 Speed is outrun by a lot in OU. This makes it difficult to sweep some of the faster teams, but it is by no means a useless set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since this Porygon-Z is meant to sweep, dual screens can help it out a lot. Gengar's Focus Blast only 2HKOes after Light Screen is up, and Choice Banded Scizor's Bullet Punch or any weaker attacks only 3HKO with Reflect set up. In fact, since most of Porygon-Z's counters are 2HKOed or OHKOed themselves, the extra survivability granted by the screens often allows you to survive a hit and KO them in return. Uxie and Cresselia are both reliable dual-screeners, and Azelf has the ability to Explode on Blissey or any special tank the opponent has after setting up the screens. Magnezone can also fulfill this role, as it can set up both screens, trap Steel-types, and use Explosion on Blissey with only one set.</p>

<p>It is important to know your opponent's team before attempting to sweep with Porygon-Z. If the foe has a Scizor or Choice Scarf Tyranitar, it should be eliminated before you set up Nasty Plot. Furthermore, you can hit Tyranitar on the switch with Hidden Power Fighting to severely weaken it before switching out. As for the choice of nature, Timid allows you to outspeed Adamant Lucario and max Speed Rotom-A, while Modest gives you more power.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Porygon-Z has a fairly large special attacking movepool; however, Tri Attack is so powerful that you should only consider moves that complement its type coverage. For the most part, you should be trying to hit Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types; Tri Attack will deal with everything else. Because of this, ignore moves such as Psychic, Signal Beam, SolarBeam, and Zap Cannon. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam have good coverage together, but are only useful on the Choice sets. Hyper Beam is a deadly suicide move, one that can even OHKO Blissey if a Modest Porygon-Z has a Nasty Plot and a Life Orb. However, it is difficult to find a moveslot for this attack.</p>

<p>Porygon-Z has an interesting support movepool as well, thanks to its more defensive pre-evolution, Porygon2. It includes Trick Room, Thunder Wave, Magnet Rise, Recycle, and more. They are better left to other Pokemon, as Porygon-Z packs so much power that it's better to spend your time destroying your targets instead of attempting to cripple them with status or play mind games. Conversion can be used with Dark Pulse and Nasty Plot (and a fourth move like Substitute, Recover, or another attack). Adaptability will make Dark Pulse as powerful as Tri Attack would once Porygon-Z is a Dark-type. The strategy takes two turns to set up, though: one to Conversion, making Porygon-Z a Dark-type (with STAB Adaptability Dark Pulse), and another to Nasty Plot, so you can do some damage. Using just Normal- and Dark-type moves will guarantee Conversion's turning you into a Dark-type. However, you can take a gamble and use a second attacking move as well.</p>

<p>Both of Porygon-Z's abilities are very potent and make it a dangerous special sweeper. Adaptability boosts the power of Tri Attack from 120 to 160 effective Base Power, giving it a considerable punch even when resisted. Download is recommended on the Choice sets, however. This is because Download boosts the power of all your special attacks by 1.5x if your target has lower Special Defense than Defense. Since you can only use one move, and it might not be Tri Attack, it is better to have that boost on your other moves as well. It is also interesting to note that a Download boosted Tri Attack is more powerful than an Adaptability boosted Tri Attack by 12%. This advantage is moot after a Nasty Plot, however. On Nasty Plot sets, Adaptability is far superior, because after one or two boosts, Tri Attack will destroy even Pokemon that resist it. On sets where you have no other means of boosting your Special Attack, use Download.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Porygon-Z can 2HKO anything in the game after a Nasty Plot, even Blissey, but often you only need to get one hit on it to knock Porygon-Z out. Its lack of resistances as a Normal-type and its average Speed make it easier to handle than it might appear. The fact that it is weak to both Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch helps, too.</p>

<p>Blissey is your best bet for countering Porygon-Z, especially ones with Toxic. Scizor with Bullet Punch can chase it away quite easily and come in on a resisted attack, and Lucario can use Vacuum Wave or ExtremeSpeed. Gengar can outrun Porygon-Z and use Focus Blast for a quick kill. Scarfed Heatran is a suitable revenge killer as well, with resistances to Tri Attack, Ice Beam, and Dark Pulse. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is in a similar boat to that of Heatran, but can Pursuit Porygon-Z as well. Basically take advantage of its average Speed and hit it with whatever you can. If you are bold enough, you can switch in a Pokemon such as Infernape or Gengar on Porygon-Z to outspeed and OHKO as it uses Nasty Plot.</p>

<p>The other sets are much easier to handle. Bulky Pokemon like Scizor, Metagross, and Tyranitar can switch in and scare them away, though Tyranitar must watch out for Hidden Power Ground, Fighting, or Water. Spiritomb, Dusknoir, and the Rotom formes can all switch in and attack it, but it's important to first find out if Porygon-Z is running Dark Pulse. Nearly anything faster than Porygon-Z that has powerful attacks, such as Azelf, can usually OHKO it or send it running. Paralysis is nearly as crippling to Porygon-Z as being hit by Scizor's Bullet Punch; once its Speed is quartered, there's really no way it's going to sweep.</b>
