[Overview]

<p>Tentacruel found its niche in OU through a very concentrated form of stall. Its ability to supply Rapid Spin, Toxic Spikes, and great special bulk all at once is extremely helpful. Tentacruel is less at home on balanced and semi-stall teams than it is on pure stall. However, its supporting abilities for the team should not be overlooked, since it is very reliable at what it does.</p>

<p>Despite carrying weaknesses to the common attacking types Ground and Electric, Tentacruel still manages to be a great defensive asset to stall teams, especially with its unusually high Speed and good Special Defense. It's a good consideration when building a defensive team, as while it isn't the best at most of the jobs it does, it can lay down Toxic Spikes extremely well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is easily Tentacruel's most effective set, as it is able to provide the team with both Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin support. Tentacruel's Water/Poison typing alone lets it switch into a multitude of threats, and also lets it clear Toxic Spikes without even using Rapid Spin. Due to its considerable bulk and good defensive typing, Tentacruel can switch in without fear on some of OU's more powerful sweepers, such as Infernape and Heatran. By setting up Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spinning other entry hazards, Tentacruel makes a great pivot for balanced and stall teams, although without recovery, it won't be switching in repeatedly. Despite this, it is still an extremely good tank, as it can threaten common sweepers with a super effective STAB Surf while being able to switch into a variety of threats without fear.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>When it comes to moves, there isn't much Tentacruel can use. Surf is the reliable STAB move of choice, since unless it carries Choice Specs, Heatran's Earth Power will fail to KO, allowing Tentacruel to Surf for the 2HKO. Similarly, Infernape's Grass Knot won't OHKO while Tentacruel's Surf does. Sludge Bomb is the best choice in the fourth moveslot since it allows Tentacruel to do heavy damage to Celebi and Shaymin while packing reasonably high neutral damage against Waters like Suicune and Starmie. The secondary poison effect is also helpful against Pokemon like Zapdos and Gyarados. Hidden Power Electric is also an option to quickly dispose of Gyarados while still doing decent damage to Water-type Pokemon, but will result in Tentacruel being unable to handle Celebi or Shaymin.</p>

<p>The given EV spread allows Tentacruel to take anything but a +2 ThunderPunch from Infernape, while also allowing it to survive most special attacks. This makes Tentacruel very difficult to KO, thus aiding its stalling ability. Knock Off is an option for your fourth move instead, since Tentacruel is most commonly found on a stall team; if it comes to a match of stall versus stall, removing the opponent's Leftovers will be beneficial. You can adjust the EVs to be more physically defensive, or you can add some more Speed to allow Tentacruel to get past some slower threats; however, reducing Tentacruel's bulk is not recommended.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Tentacruel has no reliable form of recovery, so it is often forced to rely on Blissey's Wish or something similar to avoid being quickly weakened. However, with a tweak to its EV spread, Tentacruel can be made to avoid KOs from common physical attackers such as Infernape and Machamp, and if it has set up Toxic Spikes beforehand, it can stall them out and let poison take its toll. Sleep Talk makes Rest viable, as while asleep Tentacruel can still attempt to set up Toxic Spikes or wear the foe down with Surf. This set can stick around longer, but again, Tentacruel cannot stand up to strong threats alone, or it will be hit by a strong, super effective attack. Despite this, Tentacruel can afford to set up and recover endlessly against weaker attackers or defensive Pokemon, giving its teammates safer opportunities to switch in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread has been designed so that Tentacruel isn't KOed by Heatran's Earth Power or Shaymin's Seed Flare, while also doing slightly better against more physical threats like Dragonite. However, you can try to run some more Special Defense EVs if physical threats are not a worry. This set functions most effectively on less stall-oriented teams, as it can still set up Toxic Spikes without needing full-on support. This set is more about support than defense, so don't be worried if Tentacruel dies after it sets up Toxic Spikes. Anything carrying Taunt is the best counter to this set, more so than the previous set. You can forgo Toxic Spikes altogether for one of the attacking moves mentioned in the previous set, although this takes away from Tentacruel's supportive niche. Avoid Acupressure instead of Toxic Spikes - it is a gimmick, since Tentacruel will get phazed too often, and will require a lot of stat boosts to be a viable threat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Tentacruel is generally used as a defensive supporting Pokemon, this set takes a more aggressive approach and functions as both an offensive threat and a Rapid Spinner. Hydro Pump is Tentacruel's main form of STAB, dealing major damage to any Pokemon that does not resist it. Sludge Bomb is Tentacruel's secondary form of STAB and offers excellent neutral damage when combined with Hydro Pump. Additionally, Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types significantly harder than Ice Beam thanks to the STAB boost. The last move is up to personal preference; Ice Beam secures OHKOs on Dragonite and Flygon, while Toxic Spikes supports the team by wearing the enemy down.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is different from Tentacruel's standard set, and it is one that you'd more likely find on a standard special sweeper. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Tentacruel to deal as much damage as possible, while 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Tentacruel to outpace threats such as Heatran, Lucario, Dragonite, and Gliscor, as well as Speed tie with opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon. Life Orb is the preferred item as it strengthens Tentacruel's average base 80 Special Attack, guaranteeing a 2HKO on defensive Rotom-A. Liquid Ooze is the preferred ability as it hurts opposing Leech Seed users. Clear Body doesn't help Tentacruel much because Attack drops from Intimidate—the only common method of stat reduction—don't matter to this specially offensive Tentacruel. As for other attacking options to consider in the last slot, Giga Drain can be used to hit Swampert harder than any of the other moves and gives Tentacruel some form of recovery. Hidden Power Electric is a valid option if you'd really like Tentacruel to OHKO Gyarados.</p>

<p>At a glance, this set may seem inferior to Life Orb Starmie, but Tentacruel sports several distinctive qualities that set it apart. Tentacruel's Poison typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes upon entry, and its neutrality to Grass- and Dark-type attacks make it easier for Tentacruel to switch in and out, even in the face of powerful Pursuits. Furthermore, its resistance to Bug-type attacks helps it switch in against U-turns from Scizor and Infernape as needed. Tentacruel also has greater special bulk, allowing it to switch in easily on resisted Fire-, Water-, and Ice-type special attacks. On the other hand, though, Starmie deals more damage with its higher base Special Attack, outruns more Pokemon with its higher base Speed, threatens opposing Water-types with Thunderbolt, and has increased longevity with Recover.</p>

<p>One of Tentacruel's biggest drawbacks is its inability to deal with typical bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Suicune; while Starmie is able to power through with Thunderbolt, Tentacruel's Sludge Bomb barely dents them. Tentacruel also suffers from a Ground-type weakness and a low base Defense stat, making it incredibly vulnerable to the omnipresent Earthquake. Rotom-A and Grass-types such as Shaymin and Celebi effortlessly shrug off both Electric- and Ground-type moves, making them great teammates to this Tentacruel. Other teammates to consider are Scizor and Jirachi, as they appreciate Tentacruel's ability to switch into Fire-type attacks with ease and will appreciate the Rapid Spin support to get rid of Spikes.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Tentacruel's base 70 Attack is underwhelming, but it can do reasonable damage once it obtains a Swords Dance. Combine this with its useable Special Attack and it can utilize Hydro Pump to become an effective mixed sweeper. This means that physically-oriented defenders like Skarmory can be 2HKOed by Hydro Pump with proper EV investment. Tentacruel's STAB moves - Poison Jab and Waterfall - even provide reasonable coverage coming from its newfound strength. Occasionally, Tentacruel can catch the opponent by surprise and gain a second Swords Dance boost as they switch again in fear of the first. However, even with a single Swords Dance boost, Tentacruel has enough power to 2HKO many common attackers, while its own natural bulk prevents it from getting OHKOed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>To show the effectiveness of Tentacruel, here are some damage calculations against common defensive Pokemon, especially ones that are likely to switch into Tentacruel:</p>

<ul class="damage calculation">
<li>Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Hippowdon: 87.1% - 102.9%</li>
<li>Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Forretress: 46.9% - 55.4%</li>
<li>Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Skarmory: 61.4% - 72.8%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Blissey: 63.0% - 74.1%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Poison Jab vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Celebi: 88.1% - 104.5%</li>
<li>Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Swampert: 41.6% - 49.0%</li>
<li>Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 80 SpD Rotom-A: 44.41% - 52.30%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Poison Jab vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Gyarados: 52.5% - 61.9%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Poison Jab vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Suicune: 58.9% - 69.8%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 120 Def Tentacruel: 40.9% - 48.4%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Swampert: 46% - 55%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Rotom-A: 55.3% - 65.1%</li>
<li>+2 Life Orb Poison Jab vs 156 HP / 96 Def Gyarados: 72.4% - 85.4%</li>
</ul>

<p>The EVs give Tentacruel enough Speed to outpace Pokemon in the base 80 Speed group. This includes the likes of Dragonite, Mamoswine, and Togekiss, which Tentacruel can then proceed to KO with Poison Jab or Waterfall. An alternative EV spread of 212 Atk / 80 SpA / 216 Spe and a Hasty nature can be used as this lets Tentacruel outspeed Gliscor and KO with Hydro Pump, as well as KOing Gyarados with Poison Jab, since Clear Body prevents Intimidate from working. However, the drop in power will be extremely noticeable, and Tentacruel will not get the 2HKOs it needs. Gliscor and Flygon are still good counters, as Flygon will always outspeed Tentacruel, and Gliscor can be EVed to survive Hydro Pump. After switching in, both can OHKO Tentacruel with STAB Earthquake. This can be remedied by attempting a Hydro Pump on the switch to weaken them, but this makes it harder to obtain a Swords Dance boost later on.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Tentacruel's support options aren't as limited as you might think. It has Giga Drain for dealing with Swampert and other Ground-types, even if its power is lackluster. Ice Beam can be useful for hitting Flygon and Gliscor on the switch, although they're going to beat you with Earthquake most of the time. Confuse Ray and Mirror Coat can be good for hurting the foe more, but Tentacruel's other options are generally better. Tentacruel can attempt to use Accupressure to sweep when it's the last Pokemon on your team, but this is a bad idea as it'll likely be KOed before it can accumulate enough boosts.</p>

<p>Aside from Leftovers, Tentacruel, being a Poison-type, can use Black Sludge to heal HP. This makes Trick users more wary about using Trick, but if that happens then they also have a damaging item to Trick onto your non-Poison Pokemon. You can try running an alternate EV spread with Timid and more Speed in order to 2HKO the likes of Gliscor and Roserade with Ice Beam, although 252 HP is a priority. 216 Special Attack EVs let Tentacruel always OHKO Dragonite with Ice Beam, and 132 Special Attack EVs let Tentacruel OHKO Infernape with Surf.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Despite Toxic Spikes hampering most of Tentacruel's counters, Swampert still has enough bulk to come into any attack Tentacruel has and launch an STAB Earthquake. The likes of Bronzong and Forretress are unaffected by Toxic Spikes and sometimes carry Earthquake. Similarly, Gyarados and Metagross have high-power Earthquakes while being immune to Toxic Spikes. Gengar and Rotom-A can be annoying since not only do they prevent Rapid Spin, but they also have Levitate (making them immune to Toxic Spikes) and Thunderbolt, which hits Tentacruel super effectively. Jirachi can also be a pain if it's the Calm Mind variant, as it will easily set up on you.</p>
