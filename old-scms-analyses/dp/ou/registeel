[Overview]

<p>Registeel is a fantastic Pokemon with base 150 defenses and a solid base 80 HP. With it's Steel-type, it can resist many of the Dragon-type attacks flung around in OU, while simultaneously acting a general support Pokemon to the rest of the team. Registeel also provides a solid switch-in to many set up sweepers such as Jirachi and Celebi.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In a metagame in which teams are constantly threatened by Pokémon such as Dragon Dance Kingdra, Choice Scarf Flygon, Life Orb Gengar, Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf and Calm Mind Jirachi, and SubRoost Zapdos, finding a comfortable "check" that simultaneously meshes with a wide variety of teams is difficult. This set serves to effectively "check" various threats without sacrificing general utility.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This works either as lead or as a switch-in to check a threat. If utilized as a lead, be careful with common lead Taunters and lead Heatran, which tend to run Shuca Berry. Registeel will have no problem switching into Zapdos, after which it can Ice Punch / Earthquake (on a predicted Roost) to kill Zapdos. Should Flygon or Zapdos carry high Defense or a Fire move, Registeel can easily deal with the threat by using Explosion. This can also surprise the common Choice Scarf Heatran by never getting OHKOed by Fire Blast and OHKOing back with Earthquake (again, with Expert Belt) very close to 100% of the time on a 4 HP / 0 Defense Heatran. Aside from checking these threats, it also supports its teammates by setting up Stealth Rock and Exploding on dangerous threats.</p>

<p>The last moveslot is a matter of dealing with Heatran, Metagross, Jirachi, and Tyranitar switch-ins (all of which are common) with Earthquake, or the general usefulness of Toxic. Note that Toxic will help you deal with Zapdos, Togekiss, and non-Taunt Gyarados more effectively. As for the item, that is an issue of personal preference. If specific spreads don't suit your style, you can exchange Expert Belt for Leftovers, and then shift the Attack EVs into the defenses. Since Registeel's Steel-typing is optimal for switching into Choice Specs powered Draco Meteors and the powerful attacks of Gengar and Magnezone, putting a significant amount into Special Defense is also a plausible option.</p>

<p>Fighting-types appreciate the presence of Registeel, because of its ability to take care of Zapdos and Gengar, which is a major setback for sweepers such as Heracross. Registeel can even lure and KO Heatran, which is a great benefit for Pokémon such as Scizor and basically any Pokémon with a Fire-type attack.</p>

<p>Registeel needs help with opposing Fire and Fighting-types, namely Infernape. Pokémon such as Starmie can effectively deal with Infernape, as well as any other Fighting or Fire-types that may cause Registeel trouble.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thunder Wave is a useful option for paralyzing many Pokemon that may try and stay in vs Registeel such as Skarmory and Gengar. Iron Head can be used in conjunction with Thunder Wave to take out a few Pokemon before they can even land a hit. Iron Head also provides Registeel a somewhat serviceable STAB attack that can be used to deal higher damage to Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Blissey.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Registeel is plagued by a pitifully low Attack stat which makes gaining kills a hard task. Despite being able to check a fairly large portion of the metagame, Registeel is somewhat useless against Swords Dance Scizor, Spikes Skarmory and Forretress, and many bulky Water-types. Registeel is also weak to Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, three of the most common attacking types in the metagame. Because Registeel can be such an important check to so many different kind of Pokemon, whittling it down with these super-effective attacks will bring it down.</p>
