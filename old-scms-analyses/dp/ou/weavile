[Overview]

<p>Weavile certainly isn't winning any awards defensively, as not only is he stripped of 25% of his health every time he switches into Stealth Rock, but he also has poor defensive stats and weaknesses to common attacking types, namely Rock, Fire, Steel, and Fighting. He can also be easily walled, so outside of the late-game, his sweeping potential is limited. On the other hand, Weavile's combination of Speed, Attack, and useful STAB moves can be a great asset to many teams. Is Starmie causing you trouble? Pursuit it to death. Is Choice Scarf Flygon irritating with its high Speed? Not with Weavile's Ice Shard in the wings. While Weavile faces stiff competition for STAB Dark-type attacks from Tyranitar, Weavile has significantly higher Speed and access to Ice Shard which can sometimes give him the edge depending on what your team needs. Overall, Weavile can be extremely threatening with proper team support, and as such, he is a physical attacker who should not be underestimated.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Pursuit
move 2: Ice Shard
move 3: Low Kick
move 4: Ice Punch / Night Slash
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
nature: Jolly
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>At first glance, this Weavile seems to be a generic physical attacker, but he functions as insurance against many of the metagame's top threats. This is mostly thanks to Weavile's STAB Pursuit, which allows him to outspeed and KO threats such as Gengar. Starmie is also OHKOed by Pursuit on the switch, letting your Gyarados or Infernape sweep with their check eliminated.</p>

<p>Weavile's STAB Ice-type attacks allow him to easily OHKO any Dragon-type Pokemon in OU bar Kingdra. Ice Shard is used on this set as it handles both Choice Scarf Flygon and Dragon Dance Dragonite regardless of their Speed. Low Kick OHKOes Tyranitar, whom Weavile can outspeed even after a Dragon Dance, and hits Steel- and Normal-types for super effective damage as well. Ice Punch can be used in the last slot as a means of hitting Flying- and Grass-types harder, while Night Slash can be used for stronger Dark STAB. Choice Band is the main item choice for extra power, but Life Orb is a viable option if you wish to retain decent power and still have the freedom to switch attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Gyarados and Scizor can be serious threats to this set, especially bulky variants. None of Weavile's attacks do significant damage to either, and both can do serious damage with Stone Edge and Bullet Punch respectively. Both Scizor and Gyarados fear Rotom-H as he can take most of Scizor's attacks and OHKO back with Overheat, while also OHKOing Gyarados with Thunderbolt. Choice Scarf Magnezone is a fantastic Scizor counter, as he can come in on a 4x resisted Bullet Punch and OHKO Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. Magnezone can also take care of other Steel-types who wall Weavile, such as Skarmory and Forretress. Celebi and Vaporeon are also good Gyarados counters; nothing Gyarados commonly uses can touch Celebi or Vaporeon (with the exception of Bounce in Celebi's case) and they can KO it in turn with Grass Knot or Hidden Power Electric respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Night Slash
move 3: Ice Shard / Ice Punch
move 4: Low Kick
item: Life Orb / Expert Belt
nature: Jolly
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weavile's combination of Speed and power makes him an excellent candidate for a late-game sweeper when his counters are weakened or gone altogether. With Swords Dance to boost his already impressive Attack, very few Pokemon can switch in on his boosted Night Slash, and your opponent will usually have to resort to a priority move or a Choice Scarf user to take down Weavile without taking significant damage themselves.</p>

<p>Night Slash is a great STAB move that hits most types neutrally, and Low Kick lets Weavile handle Steel-types and Tyranitar. Ice Shard is generally a better option than Ice Punch because it OHKOes the same Pokemon, such as Flygon, who you would be hitting with Ice Punch, but allows Weavile to always strike first. It is also helpful against faster Pokemon, particularly Jolteon, who is always OHKOed by a +2 Ice Shard after taking Stealth Rock damage. Still, Ice Punch is an option if you want a more powerful attack to use, especially against bulky Ground-types, namely Hippowdon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The item choice is somewhat difficult, and largely depends on personal preference. Life Orb is a great option if you can predict a switch-in well, but given the popularity of Stealth Rock and Weavile's general frailty, it's not always the best choice. Expert Belt gives your attacks a little extra kick and can help Weavile bluff a Choice item, but it's usually not needed because anyone hit with a Swords Dance-boosted super effective attack is going to faint anyway. Lum Berry is another option, as it will let Weavile set up against the likes of Blissey, who would otherwise use Thunder Wave to stop Weavile's sweep.</p>

<p>The greatest issue for this set is Scizor due to his ability to revenge kill Weavile with Bullet Punch. Scizor can easily be taken care of by a Substitute Heatran, who can take Scizor's Bullet Punch, scare it out at the prospect of a STAB Fire Blast, and set up a Substitute to wreak havoc on the opposing team. However, Heatran fears Superpower from Scizor, so this makes Gyarados and Rotom-A excellent choices to threaten him as well. Rotom-A in particular can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Scizor, while Gyarados can set up a Dragon Dance on Scizor's Choice-locked Bullet Punch and proceed to sweep the opposing team.</p>

[SET]
name: Attacking Lead
move 1: Fake Out
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Counter
move 4: Night Slash / Ice Punch
item: Focus Sash
nature: Hasty
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weavile is one of the few Pokemon who can stop the popular suicide leads in today's metagame, particularly Azelf and Aerodactyl. Fake Out is the most important move on the set, as it allows Weavile to break the Focus Sashes on leads such as Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Azelf, while keeping his own intact. Night Slash lets Weavile finish off Azelf, while Ice Punch handles Aerodactyl.</p>

<p>The other half of the set, Taunt and Counter, allows Weavile to deal with slower, bulkier Pokemon such as Bronzong. First, Taunt to prevent them from using a support move such as Stealth Rock. Now that they are forced to attack, Counter back their physical attacks for an OHKO. This strategy also works when facing a lead Metagross, who will probably attack from the start, so using Counter first is advised. This strategy is very risky, especially when facing dangerous leads such as Infernape, but if you predict correctly, the payoff is enormous.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Low Kick can be used over Counter if you want Weavile to beat Heatran and Tyranitar leads. However, keep in mind that doing this means that Weavile won't be able to deal with some other leads as easily. For instance, he can no longer Counter back Swampert's Earthquake or Metagross's Meteor Mash. While Weavile will lose out on the ability to beat these leads, he will gain the ability to beat Heatran and Tyranitar leads right off the bat, which can be valuable if your team struggles with them.</p>

<p>The occasional Pokemon with Inner Focus can be damaging to this set. In particular, Lucario leads can tear the set apart, and can also easily set up a Swords Dance against it. For this reason, Gliscor makes a great partner for Weavile, as he can check Lucario very easily thanks to his high Speed and STAB Earthquake. Swampert is also a problem; even if Weavile Taunts, Swampert could hit him with a STAB Surf, which can't be Countered. Celebi makes a fantastic Swampert counter, as he isn't heavily damaged by any of Swampert's moves, and threatens an OHKO with Grass Knot. However, using Celebi is neither a necessity or a guaranteed failsafe, as most Swampert forgo Surf in place of Ice Beam.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Punishment is useful for taking out Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, as it will do more damage than Night Slash after a few boosts. Assurance can also be used if you have Stealth Rock support, but Night Slash is generally the better choice due to its greater Base Power, high critical hit rate, and general reliability. Stay away from using special attacks, because although Weavile gets Nasty Plot, he will never be doing much damage with his terrible Special Attack stat. Focus Punch and Substitute can be used if you want Weavile to pack a more powerful Fighting-type move, although Life Orb and Substitute, as well as entry hazards, will deteriorate Weavile's health quickly. Reflect can be used, but it has little utility on such a defensively challenged Pokemon.</p>

<p>Always use a Speed-boosting nature to take advantage of Weavile's great Speed stat. Maximizing Speed isn't needed, so just aim for 373 Speed (216 EVs) to outrun Base 120 Speed Pokemon such as Dugtrio and Alakazam, and put the remaining EVs in HP. Max Attack is a given, because Weavile needs all the power he can get. On the lead set, you needn't put any EVs into HP, because the aim is to activate Focus Sash quickly so that Weavile can then use Counter to OHKO the opposing lead.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types are particularly troublesome for Weavile. Scizor is easily Weavile's greatest enemy; he can KO Weavile with either Bullet Punch or U-Turn while taking minimal damage from any of Weavile's attacks. Similarly, Metagross does a fine job beating Weavile with either Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch, although he must be wary of switching into a Choice Band Night Slash. Jirachi is a good option as he is able to withstand any attack Weavile uses and respond with Iron Head. Bronzong is also a good counter to Weavile as Weavile will have a hard time breaking through his high defenses. He can use his defensive ability to set up Stealth Rock and then subsequently KO Weavile with Gyro Ball. Skarmory can come in on Weavile to set up Spikes and then Roost off any damage Weavile inflicts, or can opt to KO Weavile with Brave Bird. Forretress can also switch into Weavile with impunity and proceed to either set up hazards or KO with Gyro Ball.</p>

<p>Pokemon with a high amount of bulk are also a challenge for Weavile, as with Weavile's pitiful defenses, almost any attack will put him in a dire situation. Gyarados is a good example, as with Intimidate he is able to take any attack Weavile throws at him and KO Weavile with Waterfall. Swampert can switch into Weavile and KO him with Earthquake, with Weavile failing to do any meaningful damage. Suicune and Vaporean can do much of the same, being able to KO Weavile with Surf before Weavile can KO them.</p>

<p>Machamp is an excellent counter to Weavile, as Weavile isn't able to do nearly enough damage to KO him before he responds with a super-effective DynamicPunch. Faster Pokemon are also major threats to Weavile. Choice Scarf Heatran and Lucario can switch into everything barring Low Kick and then proceed to outspeed and KO Weavile with their respective STABs. Jolteon outruns Weavile and can proceed to deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt. Infernape and Hitmontop can switch into any of Weavile's moves and KO him with priority Mach Punch.</p>
