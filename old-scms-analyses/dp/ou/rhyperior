[Overview]

<p>Rhyperior's biggest problem is the competition it faces for a team slot. Although it possesses greater defensive stats than any of its fellow Ground-types, its lack of instant recovery is a letdown, something Gliscor and Hippowdon both have access to. Swampert's offensive and defensive stats seem poor compared to Rhyperior, but the mudfish has superior defensive typing and can use special attacks effectively. When considering Rhyperior for a slot as an offensive Pokémon, its low Speed means it requires support to effectively use Swords Dance to sweep with. Metagross provides stiff competition for the Rock Polish variants because it is able to reach much higher speeds and employ Explosion if necessary to get a team member in for free. However, this does not take away from the fact that Rhyperior is a very powerful Pokémon. 434 HP and 394 Defense are very hard to break when paired with Solid Rock and the potential for a free Special Defense buff from a sandstorm. Rhyperior is not to be underestimated and is a good choice on most teams if you can play to its strengths.</p>

<p>In short, using Rhyperior is akin to making a pact with the devil: you gain incredible amounts of physical power. This can let you 2HKO anything in the metagame with a Choice Band, and the potential to boost your offensive prowess further with Swords Dance or Rock Polish is tempting. However, you should be ready to pay the price in accruing a painful weakness to the ever-so-common Scizor, Gyarados, and Starmie. Rhyperior is not the kind of Pokémon you can simply throw on a team and expect to succeed. It needs a good deal of support to truly shine.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge

move 4: Megahorn / Fire Punch
item: Choice Band
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rhyperior has one of the highest Attack stats in the game combined with two extremely useful STABs. Not many things will enjoy taking an Earthquake or Stone Edge from 624 Attack. The attacking combination of Ground and Rock is only resisted by a handful of Pokémon in OU, including Bronzong, Breloom, and Flygon. The remaining two slots are used to deal with these Pokémon. Aqua Tail deals a minimum of 59% damage to 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Hippowdon, a guaranteed 2HKO even when factoring in Leftovers recovery. Megahorn is Rhyperior's best option against enemy Celebi, easily OHKOing even the most defensive variants. Fire Punch allows Rhyperior to net a guaranteed 2HKO against 252 HP / 80 Def Sassy Bronzong.</p>

<p>Maximum Attack EVs are a given on a Pokémon with such an astoundingly high Attack stat. 252 Spe EVs allow Rhyperior to reach a stat of 177, just outspeeding Skarmory that sit at a stat of 176. Rhyperior is now able to 2HKO Skarmory with a Stone Edge before it has the chance to shed its Flying-type with Roost. As an alternative, Rhyperior can run 192 HP / 100 Atk / 156 SpD / 60 Spe in order to always survive 236 SpA Grass Knot from Celebi and 405 Attack Meteor Mash from Metagross. It is recommended that you run both Megahorn and Fire Punch when using this defensive spread.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>When employing this set, it is integral that you possess a response to Dragon Dance variants of Gyarados and Dragonite, as both will enjoy setting up on Megahorn and Earthquake. A Choice Scarfed Gengar is an excellent option for this role, and it is also immune to the Ground- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. Therefore, it can also deal with Flygon if it comes in on an Earthquake or a U-turn. If using a Gengar, you should have a plan to deal with Scizor. A Lucario can set up on a Pursuit aimed at Gengar and take advantage of Rhyperior's ability to pound through Hippowdon with Aqua Tail. A Gyarados or Zapdos can handle anything that Scizor possesses, but should watch out for repeated U-turns. Rotom-A also handles Gyarados, as well as Scizor.</p>

<p>Bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune will give you problems, taking your attacks and striking back with a Surf to OHKO unless you use a defensive EV spread (though Swampert cannot OHKO with Waterfall regardless). A good option to deal with this is an offensively oriented Celebi, such as a Tinkerbell or Swords Dance set. Breloom is another solid option, but you should watch for Ice Beams, as Breloom lacks the Special Defense that Celebi possesses.</p>

<p>Celebi itself gives you trouble if it comes in on anything but a predicted Megahorn or a Stone Edge with prior damage. Tyranitar is a good option to deal with Celebi, and it also sets up the sandstorm that Rhyperior thrives in. Bronzong is annoying, but isn't doing much to you with Gyro Ball, and it dislikes taking Megahorns or boosted Stone Edges. Breloom is another potent threat to Rhyperior, but Gyarados handles it fairly easily provided you have something to take the sleep.</p>

<p>Choice Band Scizor, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Starmie are also potent threats that can force out this set. Magnezone support is an option for dealing with the first two. Fortunately, Tyranitar easily revenge kills Starmie, so it is not a concern.</p>

[SET]
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Megahorn / Aqua Tail / Substitute
item: Life Orb
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rock Polish solves the problem of Rhyperior's abysmal Speed. With max Attack and Life Orb, Rhyperior will be firing off attacks with an Attack stat of roughly 492. Earthquake and Stone Edge give the set the basis of its coverage, while the fourth moveslot is used to cover specific threats. Aqua Tail seriously dents Claydol and Hippowdon while Megahorn quickly disposes of Celebi. Substitute can be used in tandem with Rock Polish in order to protect Rhyperior from status and aid in getting a boost off successfully. On this set, Fire Punch lacks the raw power to successfully deal with Bronzong, so Fire Punch is not used.</p>

<p>With a Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs, Rhyperior reaches a Speed stat of 196. Therefore, Rhyperior's Speed stat is 392 after a single Rock Polish. An Adamant nature can be used, but Rhyperior will outspeed Gengar at most, losing to Starmie, an opponent that is relatively vital to outspeed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set can handle Celebi and (barring a miss on Stone Edge) Dragonite, but still dislikes dealing with Swampert, Suicune, Gyarados, Flygon, and Breloom. Therefore, the recommended partners of this set generally mirror the partners of the previous set. One concern, however, is that unlike the Choice Bander, this set doesn't have the raw power necessary to defeat Hippowdon and Skarmory. Therefore, it is a good practice to employ a sweeper or a lure capable of breaking through a stall team. A Choice Specs Lucario can lure in such physical walls and overwhelm them on the special side. A Gyarados is another potent threat to a stall team, though Rotom-A is a concern. A Tyranitar also works well here, setting up a sandstorm and either luring in Hippowdon and Skarmory and defeating them on the special side or blasting through them with Choice Banded Aqua Tails and Stone Edges.</p>

move 4: Megahorn / Fire Punch
item: Life Orb
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A Pokémon such as Rhyperior is an excellent candidate for Swords Dance. Being aided by its somewhat impressive defensive capabilities, its massive Attack stat, and very powerful STAB attacks make Rhyperior perfect for this type of set, if it wasn't for his Speed. Thankfully max Speed is adequate to outpace most Skarmory, so using Stone Edge will be of little concern for Rhyperior. Speaking of Stone Edge, following a Swords Dance it OHKOes Gliscor if Rhyperior is using an Adamant nature; a true feat for this set. Earthquake deals massive damage even to Hippowdon, doing roughly 85% damage on average. Megahorn is an excellent choice because it 2HKOes Bronzong. Fire Punch is capable of beating down Bronzong; however, that will be the only time it will be useful.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set works best with Pokémon who can Baton Pass Speed to it or when surrounded by paralysis support. Zapdos is one of the best Agility Passing Pokémon to combine with Rhyperior, as the only real problem is Ice attacks, and quite a few of them are physical anyway. This set also functions equally well under Trick Room conditions by reversing Speed and allowing Rhyperior to attack first the majority of the time. If Rhyperior opts to use Fire Punch, it can lower its Speed to 164 EVs, just outspeeding Swampert. The remaining EVs can be invested in HP.</p>

<p>This set can deal with Dragonite, Flygon, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Skarmory, but it cannot defeat any of the other nemeses of the prior sets. As such, you should employ similar partners as for the previous sets. However, paralysis and sandstorm support are a necessity for this set because it remains abysmally slow and it needs to remain on the field in order to sweep. Using Tyranitar is a given, as Hippowdon doesn't have enough of an offensive presence. A good option for paralysis support is Celebi, who can also counter Gyarados. Jirachi is another good option for this role, as the Wish support can help Rhyperior set up. However, this will further your weakness to Earthquake. Scizor is useful here for the purpose of dispatching Celebi, who ordinarily gives this set a fair bit of trouble, but some Celebi employ Hidden Power Fire to deal with this threat.</p>

[SET]
name: Su(b)perior
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Swords Dance / Megahorn
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Leftovers
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Adamant
evs: 136 HP / 192 Atk / 16 SpD / 164 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rhyperior's ability to conjure 101 HP Substitutes, the ability Solid Rock cutting super effective moves to 1.5x damage instead of 2x, and the 1.5x boost to his Special Defense thanks to the presence of sandstorm make this Rhyperior a potent threat when played correctly. Substitute is the key move on this set. With the given EVs, Blissey is not able to break Rhyperior's 101 Substitutes with Seismic Toss. Cresselia also suffers this same scenario, provided she didn't get a Special Attack boost from Charge Beam or has Psychic in her move pool to obtain a Special Defense drop. After the Substitute is set up, Rhyperior can act accordingly by either boosting its 400 Attack stat to an impressive 800 with Swords Dance or simply using its powerful STABs to attack.</p>

<p>The Speed EVs outpace minimum Speed neutral-natured Swampert. Don't worry about being walled by Bronzong because Gyro Ball is doing pitiful damage and after a couple of Swords Dances even Bronzong won't enjoy a boosted Stone Edge. If Celebi and other bulky Psychic-types become a problem, Megahorn fits nicely over Swords Dance.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sand Stream support is an absolute requirement for this set as well, as Rhyperior needs it to turn 2HKOs from Heatran's Earth Power and Zapdos' Hidden Power Ice into 3HKOs and also to stop Blissey and Cresselia from breaking the Substitute with a super effective attack. But due to the more defensive approach of this set, Hippowdon is a good option for providing it, as well as Tyranitar. If you are using Megahorn, you don't need to worry about Celebi. If you are using Swords Dance, Swampert is not a concern, as it is outsped and OHKOed by Earthquake after a Swords Dance.</p>

<p>Choose your partners accordingly, noting that it is not optimal to choose offensive options such as Gengar if you decide to use Hippowdon for weather support. This is because Gengar is a highly offensive choice, and it works better when your team can apply offensive pressure to the opponent. Tyranitar excels at this with its powerful physical and special attacking stats (as well as its ability to lure in Scizor). Hippowdon applies little offensive pressure with its comparatively weaker Attack, non-existent Special Attack, and shallow movepool.</p>

<p>Paralysis is a bonus for this set, and Celebi and Jirachi work well at spreading it around. You will need Swords Dance to have a chance at beating opposing Skarmory and Hippowdon. If you don't use it, then you will need to employ sweepers capable of breaking through a common stall team, such as Lucario and Tyranitar. Dragonite is another option, but it despises Sand Stream.</p>

[SET]
name: Tank

move 3: Megahorn / Avalanche
move 4: Stealth Rock / Roar
item: Leftovers
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Impish
evs: 244 HP / 184 Def / 80 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The idea is pretty simple—switch into physical attackers with Rhyperior's amazing defenses and strike back with 316 Attack and great STAB moves. Megahorn provides coverage against Grass-types and makes a big dent in Cresselia and Celebi, while Avalanche hits Gliscor hard and can also bring down a Dragon Dancing Dragonite, if you don't want to rely on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Stealth Rock is always useful due to its ability to shave off a portion of any opponent's HP. Roar helps phaze Dragon Dancing Dragonite and other possible threats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With 244 HP and 80 SpD EVs in a sandstorm, Timid Heatran's Earth Power will never 2HKO Rhyperior. With an HP stat of 432, Rhyperior also receives an extra point of Leftovers recovery. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense.</p>

<p>This set does little to bulky special attackers such as Suicune and Vaporeon, who directly threaten it. A Kingdra laughs at most attacks that these Pokémon possess, and can set up Dragon Dances on them. A Dragonite or Gyarados can do the same, but they can be struck down by Ice Beam or Hidden Power Electric, respectively. Other than that, Tyranitar is an excellent partner to this set to help deal with Celebi.</p>

<p>Without the power of a Choice Band or a Life Orb boosting your Attack, you deal little damage to Bronzong, who laughs at your attacks. Rotom-A can deal with Bronzong and Gyarados. Alternatively, Heatran and Infernape can defeat Bronzong, though you are increasing your weakness to Ground-type attacks by using them in conjunction with Rhyperior. Finally, Breloom is a problem for this set, although a Gyarados or a bulky Dragonite goes a long way towards dealing with it.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Leftovers
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Impish
evs: 244 HP / 184 Def / 80 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>This set is similar to the above set, but now Rhyperior has recovery in the form of RestTalk. Rest allows Rhyperior to snooze away any damage it has taken during the course of the battle while removing any hindering status effects. Sleep Talk allows Rhyperior to continue attacking even while asleep. However, Rhyperior is not the most effective absorber of sleep, due to the opponents who commonly use the status, such as Gengar, Breloom, and Roserade. The specifications of the EVs are mentioned in the above set's comments.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Generally, this set should be paired with the partners of the above set. However, you will need a way to set up Stealth Rock, as this set sacrifices that ability in exchange for recovery. Swampert is not recommended, as having two Pokémon 4x weak to Grass-type attacks is inadvisable. Metagross, Jirachi, and Bronzong are superior candidates for that task. This is a set that you employ to defeat specific threats such as Heatran and physically based Dragonite, not a set that you build a team around.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rock Blast can be used to break Substitutes and destroys any Ninjask that dare to try and set up on Rhyperior. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if the low PP and accuracy concern you, although the flinch rate is of no real consequence on anything but the Rock Polish set. Focus Punch isn't generally much use due to a STAB Earthquake or Stone Edge having the same power and Fire Punch being just as powerful against Bronzong. Toxic works decently on the more defensive sets if bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon prove to be a large problem. Counter can be used to launch back things such as Flygon's Earthquake and unboosted Gyarados' Waterfall. Endeavor can work on the Rock Polish set if you are low on health. The only thing to say about Rhyperior's signature attack, Rock Wrecker, is that it shouldn't be used.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Barring boosted Megahorns and Focus Punches, Bronzong can shake off pretty much anything Rhyperior can throw its way and hit back with Grass Knot. Skarmory can't hurt Rhyperior, but can stall Rhyperior out—especially the Choice Band set—provided it is faster by wasting Stone Edge's PP with Roost and simply Whirlwinding Rhyperior away.</p>

<p>Swampert handles Rhyperior decently and can bring him down with STAB Water attacks. Surf and Hydro Pump are more effective than Waterfall because they hit the weaker of Rhyperior's defensive stats. Suicune also fares well if it can avoid a critical hit from Stone Edge. Hippowdon can wear Rhyperior down by alternating between Earthquake and Slack Off. Beware of Choice Banded or Swords Danced Avalanches or Aqua Tails though.</p>

<p>If you can get them in on either of Rhyperior's STAB moves, Breloom and Torterra handle Rhyperior well. Both can fire off Seed Bomb, while the latter can also use the more powerful Wood Hammer. Flygon can also work somewhat, although like the previously mentioned Grass-types, be sure to avoid Ice attacks and repeated hits from Megahorn. Defensive Celebi also works well as a counter; however, it must avoid a predicted Megahorn. STAB Grass Knot, with 120 Base Power due to Rhyperior's girth, will OHKO the rocky beast as long as Rhyperior does not invest heavily in Special Defense and a sandstorm is not raging.</p>
