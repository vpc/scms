[Overview]

<p>Blissey's enormous base 255 HP and large base 135 Special Defense stats just scream special wall; in fact, there is no better special wall in the game. While Blissey has both Softboiled and Wish + Protect, Snorlax lacks an instant recovery move, and Cresselia's Moonlight is unreliable due to the prevalence of sandstorm. Regardless, these traits combine to make Blissey impossible to OHKO with a special move without prior setup. She also makes a great team player by healing her teammates with Wish, curing them of status with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell, and crippling the opponent with Toxic and Thunder Wave. All in all, Blissey is the perfect choice for teams that are weak against special attackers such as Choice Specs Jolteon, SubPetaya Empoleon, and Life Orb Starmie. </p>

<p>Blissey does come with negative traits, however. First and foremost is her horrible Defense stat, which the opponent can easily exploit. Taunt, from the likes of Gyarados and Skarmory, also ruins Blissey and leaves her unable to wall special attacks as easily. However, with team support, Blissey is sure to do her job well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With her massive specially defensive stats, Blissey is the best special wall in the game. She can freely switch into nearly any special move, heal off the damage, and then either stall the opponent out with Toxic or slowly whittle it down with an attacking move.</p>

<p>Wish allows Blissey to heal both herself and her teammates, while Protect lets Blissey scout your opponent's move and stall for Wish healing, but Softboiled can be used to instantly heal Blissey while she uses Wish to heal her team. Seismic Toss is the superior attack as it hits all Pokemon—except Ghost-types—for 100 HP damage, but Flamethrower lets Blissey do more damming to Steel-type switch-ins, such as Scizor and Lucario, and also hit Ghost-type Pokemon. However, Flamethrower leaves Blissey walled by Heatran. Toxic rounds off the set, and works well alongside Wish + Protect to allow Blissey to stall out her foes.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are other factors worth considering when choosing between Protect and Softboiled. In addition to scouting utility, the former lets Blissey Toxic stall more easily. For example, should Choice Tyranitar use Pursuit, Blissey can stay in on it and stall it out with Toxic; if it uses Crunch, Blissey can safely switch out to a teammate. Softboiled variants, on the other hand, would have to heal every turn and risk the additional chance of a critical hit. However, Softboiled does ensure instant healing, which is useful as Blissey might otherwise become setup bait during the Protect turn.</p>

<p>In terms of alternative moves, Blissey can run Ice Beam in the third moveslot to prevent Dragonite from setting up with Dragon Dance, and either Heal Bell or Thunder Wave in the fourth moveslot to provide cleric and paralysis support. However, the latter changes leave Blissey with only one attacking move as a way to deal damage, and also prevent her from Toxic stalling.</p>

<p>Despite Blissey's outstanding Special Defense, she is easy prey for physical attackers. Her teammates should therefore be able to handle the likes of Choice Band Tyranitar, Machamp, and Swords Dance Lucario. One of the best defensive core is the well-known SkarmBliss combination, which complements Blissey's immense Special Defense with Skarmory's physical bulk. Aside from sponging a plethora of physical attacks Blissey cannot, Skarmory can also set up Spikes or phaze the opponent with Whirlwind. Forretress enjoys having Wishes passed to it, as this enables it to come back in several times to set up entry hazards or spin away entry hazards on its side. Gliscor also fulfills the role of physical wall well, as its typing provides it with a resistance to Fighting-type moves, while its access to Taunt lets it prevent opponents from healing or setting up with Taunt. Hippowdon is an incredible physical tank that can also set up Stealth Rock and use Roar to shuffle the opposing team around. Defensive Gyarados resists Fighting and has access to Roar and Taunt as well. In the meantime, Blissey can handle the various special attacks, such as Flamethrower, Surf, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, targeted at the aforementioned Pokemon.</p>

<p>Despite the synergy between Blissey and the aforementioned physical walls, there are still several Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Lucario, Dragonite, and Gyarados, who can set up on Blissey and menace her teammates. Fortunately, many different Pokemon can handle these threats. Choice Band Scizor can revenge kill all bar Babiri Berry Tyranitar. Gliscor can handle Lucario and Tyranitar with some luck, as even +1 Tyranitar might not 2HKO it with Crunch, while Gliscor can 2HKO Tyranitar in return with Earthquake. Rotom-H can handle Metagross, Lucario, and Gyarados, while a bulky Water-type, such as Vaporeon or Suicune, can handle Gyarados and Dragonite with Hidden Power Electric and Ice Beam, respectively. Should Dragonite not carry Fire Blast or Flamethrower, Skarmory can switch in and phaze it with Whirlwind. Choice Scarf Jirachi is also a good check to most of the aforementioned threats because it can KO Tyranitar with Iron Head, Lucario with Fire Punch, and Gyarados with ThunderPunch.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The idea behind this set is fairly straightforward: switch in on a special attacker, then heal your team of any status ailments. Aromatherapy is the main move on this set for this reason. With cleric support, your team no longer has to worry about having a dedicated status absorber. Softboiled provides Blissey with an instant recovery move, while an attacking move prevents her from being Taunt bait. Thunder Wave cripples Gengar and Rotom-A, who might switch in expecting Seismic Toss, while Toxic lets Blissey stall out some foes. However, the lack of Protect reduces Blissey's stalling capabilities as she can no longer alternate between Wish and Protect, and instead must rely on constantly using Softboiled.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set is incredibly useful on a stall team, whose members greatly appreciate being cured of crippling status. While she can also be used on an offensive team as burn and paralysis cripples sweepers as well, she can be a liability as the turn spent using Aromatherapy allows an opposing attacker to freely come in and immediately threaten Blissey.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, Blissey needs team support in order to deal with Pokemon she cannot handle: physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor and Lucario scare her out, while Substitute variants of Gengar and Rotom-A are immune to both Seismic Toss and status moves. Gliscor, Skarmory, Hippowdon, Gyarados, Rotom-H, Scizor, Jirachi, and bulky Water-types can check or counter most physical attackers, while Calm Mind users such as Jirachi and Suicune, as well as Spiritomb, can check Gengar and Rotom-A. Swampert can freely switch in, stop SubCharge Rotom-A from setting up, then force it out and remove its boosts with Roar.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you are not satisfied with only one attacking option, this is the set for you; it combines good coverage with the ability to spread status while sponging attacks. With an additional attacking move, opposing Pokemon will find it harder to set up on Blissey.</p>

<p>Seismic Toss is chosen for its consistency, while Ice Beam hits opposing Flygon and Dragonite, as well as Ground-type Pokemon that are immune to Thunder Wave. Flamethrower, on the other hand, is best used alongside Toxic, as it hits Steel-types that are immune to poison. However, any combination is viable; feel free to tweak the set to fit your team's needs.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stealth Rock can be used in the third slot because Blissey will have many free turns to set it up. In addition to Skarmory, Thunderbolt also hits bulky Water-types, such as Vaporeon and Gyarados, while Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran. Grass Knot is Blissey's strongest option against Swampert and Hippowdon, but Toxic deals with them well anyway.</p>

<p>Despite its slightly different moveset, this set plays similarly to other Blissey sets and requires similar team support. Physical walls are once again good partners for Blissey, as they can take the physical attacks aimed at her. Gliscor, Skarmory, and Hippowdon are all excellent physical walls with their own forms of instant recovery, while Cresselia serves as a great mixed wall. With Seismic Toss and Ice Beam, Steel-types such as Scizor and Metagross can easily come in and set up on Blissey; Rotom-H is a fantastic counter to these two Pokemon. If Blissey is using Flamethrower, Heatran can come in and poison her with Toxic, and fears only Seismic Toss due to Substitute's ability to block Thunder Wave. Tyranitar can also come in and set up Dragon Dance while fearing only a predicted Thunder Wave. RestTalk Gyarados and CroCune can handle Heatran, while Swampert, Hippowdon, Scizor, Jirachi, and Machamp can deal with Tyranitar.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Blissey can also use Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Ground to hit Dragon-types and Gliscor, Gyarados, as well as Heatran and Infernape, respectively; however, she will have to hit Infernape on the switch. Focus Blast hits Tyranitar, Lucario, and Weavile for super effective damage, but its accuracy is a large letdown. Hidden Power Fighting and Grass Knot take down Tyranitar more reliably, but Blissey can simply hit it with Toxic and then switch out; furthermore, Tyranitar is usually too threatening for Blissey to stay in on. Note that the biggest advantage of these moves is their surprise factor.</p>

<p>Counter can also work as a surprise move, but it generally only works once because the opponent will use a stronger physical move to KO Blissey the next time. Charm can soften physical blows, but it is incompatible with Seismic Toss due to breeding restrictions. Blissey can make good use of support options such as Stealth Rock and Gravity, as she can often switch in several times thanks to Softboiled and Wish. Psych Up lets her steal Calm Mind boosts from opposing Jirachi and Suicune; Blissey even has Calm Mind to boosts her own stats. Similarly, with Snatch, Blissey can steal the effects of boosting moves, Substitute, Reflect, and Light Screen.</p>

<p>There are a few other key Special Attack benchmarks Blissey might want to hit.  112 Special Attack EVs allow Blissey to OHKO 248/0 Scizor with Flamethrower after Stealth Rock, while 96 EVs enables her to OHKO 252/0 Gliscor with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. With maximum investment, Blissey can always break Charge Beam Rotom-A's Substitutes, and 252/0 Rotom-A's Substitutes 41% of the time, as well as OHKO 160/168 Scizor after Stealth Rock. 92 Speed EVs let Blissey outspeed standard 8 Speed Choice Band Scizor and KO Scizor before it can threaten her.</p>

<p>While a Bold nature is recommended, a Calm nature with a spread of 24 HP / 252 Def / 232 SpD provides larger overall defenses along with a Leftovers number. While this spread does leave Blissey 2HKOed by attacks such as Swampert's Earthquake and Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Stone Edge, this Blissey survives the 2HKO from the likes of Choice Specs Lucario's Aura Sphere and Choice Specs Heatran's Flash Fire-boosted Fire Blast.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Machamp can switch into any Blissey set with ease; while RestTalk variants can heal off status and threaten with DynamicPunch, Guts versions gain a boost from both Toxic and Thunder Wave. Heracross is in a similar boat as Machamp, but doesn't like paralysis as much. Electivire can switch into Blissey's Thunder Wave and deal large amounts of damage with Cross Chop. Scizor can use non-Flamethrower Blissey as setup bait or threaten her with Superpower, as can Lucario with Swords Dance and Close Combat, but the latter must be wary of switching into Thunder Wave. Choice Specs Lucario can also threaten standard Blissey, as her lack of Special Defense investment leaves her 2HKOed by Aura Sphere. Infernape can easily KO Blissey with Close Combat, while Breloom can come in on a status move once its Toxic Orb is activated and threaten Blissey with Spore or a Fighting-type STAB move.</p>

<p>Snorlax, non-Agility Metagross, and non-Choice Scarf or Dragon Dance Tyranitar don't mind being paralyzed and can hit Blissey hard with their STAB attacks or Pursuit. Nasty Plot Togekiss can set up on Blissey while keeping itself healthy with Roost + Heal Bell. Celebi and Shaymin can use Leech Seed to stall out Blissey. Celebi can also switch out to a more threatening teammate, while Shaymin can lower Blissey's Special Defense with Seed Flare and eventually KO her. Gengar and Rotom-A can come in on any attack besides a status move and set up a Substitute to block status; the former can use Focus Punch while the latter can set up with Substitute and Charge Beam, and potentially 2HKO Blissey with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fighting. Finally, Dugtrio can trap and KO weakened Blissey.</p>

<p>Taunt users can easily stop Blissey by preventing her from healing or spreading status. Gliscor, Gyarados, and Tyranitar are all excellent Taunt users that can either set up on Blissey or outright attack her. Trick users, such as Gengar, Rotom-A, and Starmie, can also cripple Blissey by reducing her ability to wall attacks.</p>
