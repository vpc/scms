[Overview]

<p>Kingdra had often been bashed in past generations due to its poor movepool; however, DPP has given it an array of blessings, including incredible new options such as Outrage. While Kingdra's movepool still isn't anything to write home about, it can do a lot with what it has. All in all, Kingdra has changed from quite the mundane sweeper to a Pokemon that many teams will have significant problems with.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Excellent dual STABs in Waterfall and Outrage coupled with Dragon Dance make Kingdra a top threat capable of sweeping unprepared teams. Kingdra's excellent defensive typing, along with its deceptively bulky stats, allow it to take strong special hits and Dragon Dance with a comfortable amount of HP remaining. Suicune and Starmie, two excellent checks to other Dragon-types, usually hope to bait Outrage, only to find themselves unable to stop Kingdra from setting up two or three Dragon Dances, then Rest and restore itself to full health thanks to Chesto Berry. Chesto Berry will not cure anything but sleep, so Pokemon relying on Will-O-Wisp or Toxic might think that they have beaten or crippled Kingdra, only to find they have given it an opportunity to gain more boosts before healing off status with Rest. With its boosted Waterfall, Kingdra is able to beat many Pokemon without locking itself into Outrage, and becomes very difficult to stop if the opponent no longer has a defensive wall such as Skarmory or Forretress.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The HP and Special Defense EVs are chosen so that Kingdra will survive at least two attacks from Life Orb Starmie and +1 Suicune. This special bulk allows Kingdra to Dragon Dance without fear of a 2HKO. A minimum of 164 Speed EVs should be used to outpace Choice Scarf Flygon after two Dragon Dance boosts. While the idea of this set is to Dragon Dance in spite of status moves and bulky Water-types thanks to Chesto Berry, Lum Berry is an acceptable substitute. With Lum Berry, Kingdra can cure itself of confusion if it is forced to Outrage before it is able to Rest. Lum Berry makes the set vulnerable to status users that Kingdra would otherwise have little difficulty setting up against, though.</p>

<p>Because the point of this set is to set up on opposing bulky Water-types, strong Fire-type attackers such as Heatran and Infernape make excellent partners to this set. In addition, sweepers such as Tyranitar are good teammates to clean up the remnants of the opposing team after Kingdra has eliminated the opposing bulky Water-types. Because Kingdra's only weakness is to Dragon-type attacks, Steel-types are able to switch in and set up on the opponent's attempts to revenge kill Kingdra; Heatran, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross are ideal for this role. Rather than Kingdra's typical counters, this Kingdra is hindered by very defensive Pokemon. Kingdra almost always finds itself unable to beat Pokemon such as Skarmory, Swampert, and Metagross. Again, Heatran makes an ideal partner for beating down these defensive threats; Heatran can even run Hidden Power Grass to lure and eliminate Swampert.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With two physical STAB options to go with Dragon Dance, Kingdra is a fearsome foe with nearly perfect type coverage provided by Waterfall and Outrage; the combination is resisted only by Empoleon and Shedinja. Kingdra can use its unique typing to set up on opposing Pokemon that are unable to do significant damage to it, such as Starmie, Heatran, and Vaporeon. Substitute protects Kingdra from status moves that could otherwise ruin its sweep, and can help it set up on Pokemon such as Toxic Vaporeon. When using a Lum Berry, it is best to Dragon Dance the first time the foe uses a status move on Kingdra, and then use Substitute the next time to get another Dragon Dance as they hopelessly try to status Kingdra once more.</p>

<p>This Kingdra has trouble with bulky physical walls with a phazing move, such as Skarmory, Suicune, and Swampert. Magnezone can trap Skarmory who lack Shed Shell, and its powerful STAB Thunderbolt will scare off Suicune. If you pack Hidden Power Grass, it can even beat Swampert. Rotom-A also works well at warding off said Pokemon, although it cannot trap Skarmory. Celebi easily defeats Suicune with Leaf Storm or Perish Song, and it will also appreciate Kingdra's resistance to Fire-type attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum Speed EV investment is used to guarantee that Kingdra outspeeds neutral xnatured base 80 Speed Pokemon and Gyarados. 252 Attack EVs are used to maximize Kingdra's power. More bulk can be used to make Kingdra's Substitutes bulkier, but this is generally not worth the loss in power or Speed. While both abilities are viable, Swift Swim is arguably the better option as it enables Kingdra to take advantage of opposing Rain Dance teams. Most Pokemon on Rain Dance teams are slower than Kingdra, so Outrage can rip through these teams once Steel-types are removed.</p>

<p>Celebi can do a decent job against Kingdra because of its bulk, but Substitute will block Thunder Wave, so it must be careful it doesn't give Kingdra too many free Dragon Dances. Some good options for dealing with Celebi are Scizor and Tyranitar. Specially defensive versions are the best ways to defeat Celebi, as this almost always ensures Scizor will survive Hidden Power Fire, and lets Tyranitar more easily sponge Grass Knot. They both have super effective moves at their disposal to take out Celebi, and even switching out is not an option for Celebi, as it might take lethal damage from Pursuit.</p>

<p>Faster Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Naive Heatran can cause Kingdra problems, as they are able to revenge kill it if it only has one Dragon Dance and isn't behind a Substitute. Scizor and Tyranitar can trap Starmie, using Pursuit to take it out. Having a Steel-type on your team can help in taking an Outrage from Flygon or a Dragon Pulse from Heatran. Heatran is probably your best bet for countering opposing Heatran because it only fears Earth Power, while your Heatran can revenge kill it with an Earth Power of its own. Heatran can also revenge kill Flygon locked into Outrage with Dragon Pulse. You must also be wary of Steel-types switching into Outrage to revenge kill Kingdra; it is therefore useful to have Magnezone on your team. Choice Scarf Magnezone is ideal, as it can trap and kill most Steel-types thanks to Magnet Pull. Toxic Spikes support from Roserade can be useful as well, as the poison grants Kingdra an easier time against bulkier Pokemon such as Celebi, Suicune, Swampert, and Vaporeon. Roserade can also absorb your opponent's Toxic Spikes, because Kingdra's sweeping time will be cut short if it is statused.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is arguably Kingdra's most destructive set, capable of smashing through even the game's most defensive Pokemon. It can work very well outside of Rain Dance teams, but is generally best used with rain support from its teammates. Hydro Pump is the real selling point of the set, as it significantly out-damages Waterfall and demolishes the physically based OU metagame. Surf can be used, but it doesn't pack the power that Hydro Pump does. Draco Meteor rounds out the set by allowing Kingdra to deliver a powerful hit to Grass-types and opposing Water-type Pokemon that resist its Water-type STAB. On Rain Dance teams, though, you will have other Pokemon to set up Rain Dance, so you might not need it on Kingdra.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs generate enough Speed to outrun Jolly Choice Scarf Jirachi and Flygon in the rain. The natures listed do not drop Kingdra's Attack or Special Attack, but which defense stat to drop is up to you. Life Orb is the obvious item, because Kingdra greatly appreciates the power boost. As alternatives to Rain Dance, Signal Beam is a great alternative to hit Celebi hard, KOing after it switches into Hydro Pump or Waterfall, while Hidden Power Electric enables Kingdra to 2HKO offensive Empoleon, as well as OHKO Gyarados every time with Stealth Rock support.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock support is incredibly useful to this set as it provides Kingdra with a much better chance of attaining notable OHKOs. Azelf, Bronzong, Jirachi, and Swampert are the best options for Rain Dance teams as they can all provide both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock. The same Pokemon can also do well outside of Rain Dance teams, but Swampert is not recommended in this case due to similar typing. Toxic Spikes wreck this set, so having a Rapid Spin user such as Starmie can be useful to get rid of them. Qwilfish and Roserade can absorb Toxic Spikes, and Roserade can set up its own to help against the bulky Water-types and Celebi; both can also set up Rain Dance. Qwilfish can make a deadly partner as its Swords Dance-boosted Waterfalls rip through much of OU, and a well-timed Explosion on one of Kingdra's counters could prove useful.</p>

<p>Celebi, Empoleon, Gyarados, Tentacruel, and most bulky Water-types can make good counters, although Hydro Pump + Draco Meteor can 2HKO many of them. Celebi must watch out for Signal Beam as well; after a Hydro Pump or Waterfall, it will KO. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon are good revenge killers. Scizor and Skarmory can make good partners, as they are are the best options to deal with Flygon. Other Steel-types can also take out Flygon locked into Outrage, and ones with Rain Dance will be especially helpful. Tyranitar and Abomasnow also do well against Kingdra by taking away its precious rain, and although Tyranitar is weak to Water-type moves, it won't be OHKOed and can OHKO in return with a Choice Band Stone Edge. Abomasnow resists Water-type moves and can survive Draco Meteor thanks to its solid Special Defense. Blizzard will also badly hurt Kingdra; alternatively, Abomasnow can SubSeed stall it. Scizor therefore makes a great partner again to deal with them thanks to its STAB- and Technician-boosted Bullet Punch. Choice Band Dugtrio can trap and OHKO Tyranitar with Earthquake, and finish off a weakened Abomasnow with Stone Edge.</p>

name: Mixed Dragon Dance

move 4: Ice Beam / Hydro Pump
item: Life Orb
nature: Naughty / Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 24 SpA / 232 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes a more offensive approach than the former set. Kingdra retains its two physical STAB options, Waterfall and Outrage, but also carries a special attack to hit physical walls harder. The big difference is that with Life Orb, Kingdra can utilize Hydro Pump to 2HKO Skarmory or Ice Beam to take out opposing Dragon-type Pokemon without needlessly locking itself into Outrage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given Speed EVs give Kingdra a stat of 264, enough to outrun base 130 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance. After this, Attack is maximized and the remaining EVs put into Special Attack. Swift Swim is arguably the preferred ability since you can take advantage of opposing Rain Dance teams. This Kingdra can actually be a very good sweeper in a Rain Dance team; with doubled Speed and boosted Water-type attacks, it will be an absolute terror. Hydro Pump would be the best option in that case.</p>

<p>Electric-types such as Jolteon, Rotom-A, and Magnezone work well alongside Kingdra, as they are able to force out enemy bulky Water-types. Jolteon and Rotom-A make fairly good counters to Celebi, due to Grass Knot having a pathetic Base Power against the pair. If Jolteon can switch in safely, Shadow Ball will badly hurt Celebi. Magnezone can trap Steel-types so Kingdra doesn't have to worry as much about locking itself into Outrage. These Electric-types also come in handy when using Ice Beam over Hydro Pump, as Skarmory once again becomes an issue.</p>

<p>Similar to the Substitute + Dragon Dance set, fast Choice Scarf users are an annoyance unless you pack Rain Dance support. Scizor and Tyranitar can trap and kill Choice Scarf Gengar and Starmie with Pursuit, and Steel-types can switch into Choice Scarf Flygon's Outrage and take it out with an appropriate move. Toxic Spikes can drastically hinder Kingdra; therefore, a Rapid Spin user or Poison-type to remove them is a good option. Roserade is a great choice as it can also incapacitate a Pokemon with Sleep Powder, as well as set up its own Toxic Spikes to give Kingdra an easier time against bulky Water-types and Celebi. Starmie too can Rapid Spin; Life Orb Starmie also lures in Celebi, Suicune, and Rotom-A, and can severely weaken each of them with an appropriate move.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a purely special rain sweeper. It can't hurt Blissey much, but this set has some advantages over the mixed version. Kingdra doesn't need Attack EVs, so it can maximize Speed, making revenge killing it a much harder task. Hydro Pump can be used for some extra power, specifically to OHKO Swampert and Metagross, but Surf's reliability makes it the better choice overall. Signal Beam may seem a bit specific, but scores some nice KOs, namely against Celebi and Abomasnow after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Electric is an alternative option if you don't particularly fear the aforementioned Grass-type Pokemon; it 2HKOes offensive Empoleon, and does slightly more damage to other Water-types in comparison to STAB Dragon Pulse.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum Speed is used because winning the Speed tie with opposing Kingdra can be game-changing. Kingdra also outspeeds all common Choice Scarf users with support from the rain. Maximum Special Attack is obvious for hitting as hard as possible. If you prefer, an alternative bulkier EV spread of 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe can be used instead to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar outside of rain, and positive natured Choice Scarf base 100s in rain. Life Orb is used for the power boost, which makes Surf a very deadly attack. One could use Damp Rock, but this Kingdra should generally be sweeping, not supporting.</p>

<p>As with the mixed Rain Dance set, Stealth Rock support is recommended. Azelf, Bronzong, Jirachi, and Swampert are the best options for this Kingdra on Rain Dance teams. Toxic Spikes are problematic for this set, so a Rapid Spin user such as Starmie helps. Qwilfish and Roserade can absorb Toxic Spikes, and Roserade can set up its own to help take down bulky Water-types and Celebi. Qwilfish also makes a deadly Rain Dance sweeper, so it makes a nice partner.</p>

<p>This set is a lot harder to revenge kill, but there are still many Pokemon that cause it problems. Bulky Water-types not named Swampert counter this set well, as even Hidden Power Electric won't 2HKO most of them. Thanks to its powerful STAB Grass-type attacks, Ludicolo makes an amazing partner to this Kingdra on Rain Dance teams. Jolteon, Rotom-W, and Zapdos can also do well against the aforementioned Pokemon. This set also has trouble against special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax; Choice Band Dugtrio therefore makes a nice partner to trap and 2HKO Blissey, as well as to finish off weakened Snorlax. Scizor is also an option, as Superpower takes care of Blissey and Snorlax. It can also do well against Tyranitar and Abomasnow, whose abilities remove the rain.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The strategy on this set is to use Rain Dance first. As Waterfall is Kingdra's main attack, this is the equivalent of the boost from Dragon Dance, but it immediately doubles Kingdra's Speed to outpace many Choice Scarf revenge killers. Rain Dance also clears other weather effects, thereby restoring Kingdra's Leftovers recovery, and offers the rest of your team temporary protection from Fire-type attacks. Kingdra can then attack or continue to set up with Dragon Dance. After a Dragon Dance in the rain, Kingdra essentially gains three times as much Speed and a 2.25x boosted Waterfall, able to crush offensive teams. Even Choice Scarf Flygon will fail to outspeed with rain falling from the sky if Kingdra has obtained a Dragon Dance. Unlike the Dragon Dance set, Kingdra can also afford to invest in his HP, thus improving Kingdra's survivability and increasing the chance of it getting the opportunity to set up Dragon Dance.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>224 Speed beats bulky Gyarados and Adamant Tyranitar outright. It also allows Kingdra to outrun base 100s after Dragon Dance, as well as neutral Choice Scarf base 100s after Rain Dance. The remaining EVs allow Kingdra to hit 336 HP, a Leftovers number. Four Attack EVs can be moved to HP to allow Kingdra an extra turn of survival when the only damage is residual. When using Damp Rock, this Leftovers threshold isn't important so you can opt for more Speed to outrun more threats in the rain.</p>

<p>This set has the same counters as the first set, but is slightly harder to revenge kill thanks to Rain Dance doubling its Speed. Empoleon, Skarmory and Suicune are all good counters, and can phaze it out before Kingdra gets a chance to Dragon Dance. If using this Kingdra on a Rain Dance team, Ludicolo can be a great partner to deal with most of these threats, thanks to STAB Grass-type attacks and a powerful Surf with which to hit Skarmory. Ludicolo will also outspeed and 2HKO offensive +2 Speed Empoleon with either Energy Ball or Grass Knot. Outside of Rain Dance, powerful Electric-types such as Jolteon and Rotom-A can scare the aforementioned Pokemon off. Jolteon needs Hidden Power Grass for Swampert, though, and is very frail, so it can't switch in directly. Rotom-A, however, can do very well. Rotom-C stands out as an exceptional choice, as Swampert is OHKOed by Leaf Storm. Celebi can make a nice partner for dealing with bulky Water-types thanks to STAB Grass-type attacks and solid defenses.</p>

<p>Scizor can do well on Rain Dance teams, as it can deal with many problematic Pokemon, including Abomasnow and Tyranitar. Roserade and Starmie can make nice partners for getting rid of Toxic Spikes. Bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzong, Jirachi, and Magnezone all make good partners. They can set up Rain Dance should you use Kingdra on a Rain Dance team, take the Dragon-type moves aimed at Kingdra, and also set up Stealth Rock in Bronzong and Jirachi's case.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kingdra's Dragon-and Water-type STAB core form a nearly perfect combination, so there are no reasons to use any other attacks for this set. The idea is to come in on predicted non-damaging support moves, or Fire- and Water-type attacks, and unleash pain on your opponent. Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump are good early-game moves for tearing holes in the opposing team, while Surf and Dragon Pulse are better used for sweeping late=game since they have decent power and perfect accuracy.</p>

<p>With four STAB moves, it is important to know when it is appropriate to use each attack. The choice for which move to use depends mainly on what Kingdra switches into. For example, if Kingdra switches in on a Heatran's Fire Blast early in the game, Draco Meteor is the best option to use as it will beat Naive Choice Scarf Heatran whether they switch or not, and will maim an incoming Water-type resist. Later in the game, Surf and Hydro Pump are generally safer options because most Water-type resists are Water-type Pokemon and do not threaten Kingdra directly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on the set allow Kingdra to outspeed Adamant Lucario, Jolly Mamoswine, and Jolly Gyarados before a Dragon Dance, which gives Kingdra a chance to defeat them before they wreak havoc. It is important to note that the preferred ability on this set is Swift Swim, because a Timid Kingdra with 286 Speed outspeeds everything commonly seen on a Rain Dance team, and other Kingdra almost never run Speed-boosting natures. A Modest nature can be used instead to achieve more power.</p>

<p>Like any offensive Pokemon, Kingdra will appreciate residual damage to secure more KOs. However, Choice Specs Kingdra is more of a supporter for the team, as it offers a very sturdy resist to Fire- and Water-type attacks and the power to retaliate against many Pokemon that carry those moves. Therefore, pairing Kingdra with Pokemon that have weaknesses to these types will allow more opportunities for Kingdra to switch in and fire off attacks. One thing to note is that Kingdra is susceptible to Toxic Spikes and neutral to Stealth Rock, so a grounded Poison-type or a Rapid Spin user will increase the number of times Kingdra will enter the field to do damage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Kingdra lacks any form of recovery outside of Rest, his excellent typing and respectable 75 / 95 / 95 defenses make it a great status absorber and offensive tank. Unlike other Kingdra sets, this one can actually switch in multiple times throughout the match without worrying too much about taking damage and status effects. People are often even thrown off-guard by Rest, since some just aim at weakening Kingdra to the point of revenge killing with a priority attacker—a strategy that will lead straight to their demise against this set.</p>

<p>Typically, this Kingdra will be able to Dragon Dance a few times then Rest off the damage before using Outrage. Sleep Talk remedies the issue of being locked into Outrage if it is selected while sleeping, and thus makes Outrage the superior choice over Waterfall as Kingdra's STAB attack. Outrage also has the advantage of not being walled completely by the likes of Vaporeon and other Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks, and allows Kingdra to hit Dragon-types for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Kingdra's main purpose on a team is to act as a pseudo-counter to many common Pokemon while still maintaining offensive momentum. It makes a great addition to any balanced team, particularly those that carry Pokemon to beat common phazers and stall, which are this set's downfall. This set is usually better suited as an early- to mid-game sweeper as it tends to outlive most of its counters in the long run and will have multiple opportunities to switch in. Unfortunately, being countered by common OU Pokemon, such as Scizor and Metagross, tends to hinder Kingdra's effectiveness.</p>

<p>An EV spread of 252 HP / 96 Atk / 160 SpD will allow Kingdra to shrug off special attacks directed at it and easily set up on defensive Pokemon such as Celebi, Swampert, physical Jirachi, Vaporeon, Suicune, Hippowdon, Blissey, and Dusknoir. Life Orb Starmie can only 4HKO this set, turning a powerful sweeper into setup fodder. Despite these advantages, it may be worthwhile to use a more offensive spread; if you decide to go this route, using an EV spread of 244 HP / 112 Atk / 152 Spe with an Adamant nature is recommended. This grants Kingdra the ability to outrun Choice Scarf Tyranitar after one Dragon Dance, and gives it a Leftovers number.</p>

<p>This set benefits from partners who can switch in on the Steel-type Pokemon whom Kingdra has trouble against, particularly Metagross, Scizor, and Skarmory. Rotom-A makes a decent partner to this set for its ability to take on all three of the noted Pokemon. Unless they switch in on Superpower or Earthquake respectively, Heatran and Infernape can threaten all three Pokemon listed; Kingdra in turn can switch in on many Ground- and Water-type attacks that threaten these Pokemon. Thanks to Magnet Pull and a resistance to Dragon-type attacks, Magnezone is one of the best partners for Kingdra. However, care must be taken to make sure Magnezone doesn't switch in on a Scizor U-turn or Metagross Earthquake.</p>

<p>Having a Steel-type Pokemon of your own to switch in on Dragon-type attacks from Dragonite or Choice Scarf Flygon is also a good idea. Scizor can switch in on all of the aforementioned Dragons, take a Dragon-type attack, and hit them with Bullet Punch. Choice Band Scizor works best as it has Pursuit to take out fleeing Starmie and Celebi, and also tends to attract Fire- and Water-type Pokemon, whom Kingdra can set up on.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Although only a minor option, Yawn can replace Substitute on the first set, as Yawning your opponent's first switch-in can result in forcing them to go to a Pokemon less equipped to deal with Kingdra, lest they allow their best Kingdra counter to be put to sleep. If they decide to save their Pokemon from sleep, Yawn has the added benefit of racking up residual damage on both opposing Pokemon. In addition, since their second switch-in to Kingdra will more than likely be unable to handle Kingdra to the same extent as their first, you might be able to pull off an extra Dragon Dance.</p>

<p>Kingdra's movepool is fairly shallow and it doesn't have much in the way of other options. Flail is decent if you can manage it, but good luck pulling it off with Tyranitar, users of priority moves, and Stealth Rock everywhere. Kingdra can run a Choice Band set, but the lack of a decent physical movepool hinders its viability.</p>

<p>Specific EVs are given for each set. Adamant, 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe is best for the Substitute + Dragon Dance set. The Mixed Rain Dance set could use Naughty, 252 Atk / 240 SpA / 16 Spe to outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran in the rain, but Naughty, 192 Atk / 240 SpA / 76 Spe is a good alternative to outspeed +1 neutral-natured base 100s at the slight cost of Attack. Adamant, 252 Atk / 24 SpA / 232 Spe is the best option for the mixed Dragon Dance set. The Special Rain Dance set should use either Modest 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe or Modest, 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe for a bit more bulk. Timid, 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe can even be used for surprise factor outside of rain, as well as to outspeed almost all opposing Kingdra and +2 Jolly Gyarados in the rain. The Double Dance set is best with Adamant, 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe, but can use Adamant, 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe to outspeed +1 positive-natured base 100s in the rain.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Empoleon easily walls most mixed and special Kingdra sets, fearing only the occasional Hidden Power Electric, but when it comes to the Dragon Dance set, Empoleon has to focus its EVs into Defense or it will be 2HKOed by boosted Outrages. Celebi and Tangrowth also do decently at stopping Dragon Dance sets, but still have to be wary of Life Orb variants as Outrage can 2HKO both of them. Although hits from Draco Meteor will still take their toll, Milotic, Ludicolo, Suicune, and Vaporeon are also effective at stopping the mixed and special sets as well, due to their Water-type resistance and good Special Defense. Blissey and Snorlax will beat the specially based Rain Dance set. Tyranitar and Abomasnow also can annoy Rain Dance sets by taking away their rain and hitting back hard.</p>
