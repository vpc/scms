[Overview]

<p>Once upon a time, Raikou was one of the most dominant special attackers in the entire game, and ignoring it would be PokeSuicide. Unfortunately, that time is long since past in the ADV metagame. With the addition of Choice Scarf, Toxic Spikes, and monstrously powerful attackers such as Heatran, Raikou has been largely left in the dust in DPP. However, it's not all grim for Raikou. While Raikou faces stiff competition both as an Electric-type attacker and as a Calm Mind user, it's still more than adept at both, and with the addition of coverage moves such as the now-special Shadow Ball and Aura Sphere, Raikou still has all the tools it needs to be a top threat this go around.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind

move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Fighting
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a pretty straightforward set, and still one of Raikou's most lethal. After a Calm Mind, Raikou's looking at 493 Special Attack, which becomes even scarier when backed by a Life Orb and STAB Thunderbolt. There are very few Pokemon that can come in on this beast once it's gotten a Calm Mind up, and with Calm Mind's boost to Raikou's already solid 100 base Special Defense, the opponent is essentially limited to checking Raikou with physical Pokemon, allowing it to sweep unprepared or worn down teams with impunity.</p>

<p>The choice of Thunderbolt here is obvious, as after STAB, Life Orb, and a Calm Mind, it's pretty hard to survive it unless you resist it or your name is Blissey or Snorlax. Shadow Ball provides important type coverage, hitting Rotom-A and Celebi hard, as well as dealing significant damage to neutral targets. Hidden Power Grass is mainly used for smacking Swampert around, though it's also effective against other Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Mamoswine. Hidden Power Fighting is a viable alternative if you're not afraid of Swampert, as it hits Tyranitar extremely hard. The standard Choice Band Tyranitar is OHKOed 100% of the time after Stealth Rock by Hidden Power Fighting, and with solid prediction, Raikou can also nail Choice Scarf variants for serious damage on the switch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Aura Sphere is an alternative for the last slot, as it allows you to hit Blissey extremely hard and also guarantees an OHKO on all variants of Tyranitar. However, using it requires a Rash nature, which lowers Raikou's Speed from 361 to 329. This isn't all bad, though; you lose the ability to Speed tie with Azelf and Starmie, and you are also outsped by Infernape and Gengar, but with Calm Mind, the only threat posed by these Pokemon are physical attacks from Azelf and Infernape. On top of that, the Rash nature guarantees some notable KOs, such as an OHKO on Celebi and Rotom-A with Shadow Ball. Hidden Power Ice is also an option, as it hits Dragonite and Gliscor and allows Raikou to threaten Flygon on the switch, but it also leaves Raikou completely walled by Swampert.</p>

<p>There's really no reason to get fancy with the EVs here. Simply maximizing Speed and Special Attack with the leftovers in HP suffices. A Timid nature allows Raikou to outspeed Gengar and Infernape, and also tie with Azelf and Starmie. However, when using Aura Sphere, a Rash nature is required, and the advantages and disadvantages of that were detailed in the above paragraph.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is absolutely necessary for the success of this set in order to net OHKOs on some notable Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Celebi, and Rotom-A. This set also benefits a lot from Rapid Spin support, as Raikou tends to get worn down fairly quickly between Stealth Rock, sandstorm damage, and Life Orb recoil. Forretress can lay down Stealth Rock and use Rapid Spin, while Starmie is an excellent offensive Rapid Spin user that benefits from Raikou's ability to switch into Electric-type attacks. Raikou also needs a teammate that can get rid of Blissey, as it walls Raikou until the ends of the earth. Heatran can lure in Blissey and kill it with Explosion. Scizor and Tyranitar can Pursuit it, though Scizor is preferred since the sandstorm Tyranitar brings tends to have a significant negative effect on this set's performance. If neither of these are to your liking, a powerful Fighting-type Pokemon like Lucario and Machamp can come in on the pink blob and obliterate it with Close Combat or DynamicPunch, respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: SubCM
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 128 HP / 76 Def / 52 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With the combination of Substitute and Calm Mind, Raikou can set up on the bulky Water- and Grass-types that are commonly found on many teams, such as Vaporeon, Milotic, Celebi, and Shaymin that lack Earth Power. Substitute also allows Raikou to avoid status ailments and Trick, which can give it even more chances to set up.</p>

<p>With Substitute and Calm Mind, this set only has room for a single coverage move. The most effective choices for this slot are Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass. Electric and Ice provide excellent two-move coverage, and Hidden Power Ice's poor Base Power is supplemented by this set's ability to set up multiple Calm Minds. Hidden Power Ice also easily defeats Flygon, which is a common Raikou switch-in, and Substitute guarantees that Raikou can KO Flygon before it gets hit by Earthquake. However, Hidden Power Grass is an effective option and hits Swampert, which effectively walls Hidden Power Ice variants.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>128 HP EVs means that defensive variants of Celebi cannot break Raikou's Substitutes after a single Calm Mind. Pairing the HP EVs with 76 Defense EVs means that Jolly Flygon cannot break Raikou's Substitutes with U-turn. Speed is maximized with a Timid nature to beat Gengar and Infernape as well as tie with Starmie and Azelf, and the remainder is dropped into Special Attack. Leftovers is used to replenish the HP lost by using Substitute, and prove especially effective against Pokemon that cannot break Raikou's Substitute in one hit.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes are simultaneously this set's best friend and greatest enemy depending on which side of the field they're on. Toxic Spikes from an enemy will put a timer on Raikou's sweeping potential, but when set up on the opponent's side of the field, they allow Raikou to outstall Blissey, Celebi, Swampert, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and other Pokemon that usually threaten this set. As a result, Forretress is one of the most effective teammates for this set due to its ability to set up Toxic Spikes and then spin away entry hazards on your side of the field. Roserade is also an excellent teammate, as it can set up Toxic Spikes and absorb opposing Toxic Spikes simply by switching in. This set also works extremely well with Gyarados for multiple reasons. Gyarados can switch in on opponents packing Earthquake, which is the most common attack used against Raikou. Gyarados is also especially effective against Metagross, which can be extremely hazardous for this set. As an added bonus, Gyarados tends to lure in bulky Water- and Grass-types for Raikou to set up on, which significantly improves its ability to threaten opposing teams.</p>

[SET]
name: Attacking Lead
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: ExtremeSpeed
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Extrasensory / Shadow Ball / Aura Sphere
nature: Rash
item: Lum Berry
ability: Pressure
eVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its excellent Special Attack, solid type coverage, and priority in the form of ExtremeSpeed, Raikou can serve as an extremely effective attacking lead. This lead is designed to pose a significant offensive threat from the first turn onward, forcing opponents to decide whether entry hazards are worth facing a 100% Raikou. Thunderbolt serves as the primary STAB move, and with maxed Special Attack and a Rash nature, it hits like a truck. Thunderbolt easily puts most faster leads into KO range for ExtremeSpeed, while many slower leads, such as Heatran and Metagross, are 2HKOed with ease. Hidden Power Ice covers most Pokemon resistant to or immune to Thunderbolt, including Celebi, Shaymin, Gliscor, Dragonite, and Flygon. The last slot is up to personal preference. Extrasensory is the preferred option, as while it provides largely redundant coverage, it OHKOes Breloom and guarantees a 2HKO on Machamp and Roserade. The flinch chance can also prove valuable, as getting an Extrasensory flinch on either Roserade or Machamp lets you beat them without taking any damage at all. Shadow Ball is your best option against Rotom-A, and also guarantees victory against bulkier Azelf leads. Finally, Aura Sphere hits Tyranitar and Mamoswine, and also gives Raikou a more powerful option against Heatran.</p>

<p>One of the big advantages of this set is that despite the need to run a Special Defense reducing nature, Raikou is still incredibly bulky. Its 90/75/100 defenses allow it to take almost any attack that an opposing lead would throw at it. For example: Heatran needs a Life Orb in order to OHKO Raikou with Earth Power or Fire Blast; even with a Rash nature, Timid Heatran still does only 80.1% damage maximum to Raikou with Fire Blast or Earth Power. Roserade's Leaf Storm maxes out at 90.7% damage. Even Starmie's Hydro Pump only does 87% damage max. Meanwhile, on the physical side, Machamp's DynamicPunch can't deal more than 83.2% damage, and even Focus Sash Aerodactyl's Earthquake fails to OHKO. The only lead that can reliably OHKO Raikou is Metagross, which in turn is 2HKOed by Thunderbolt, meaning that its user has to choose between killing Raikou or setting up Stealth Rock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is simple: just maximize Special Attack and Speed. The inability to run a Timid nature on ExtremeSpeed Raikou may seem like an issue, but few leads sit between Rash and Timid's speed tiers. Rash Raikou has 329 Speed, which is fortuitous in that it allows Raikou to outspeed all non-Choice Scarf base 100 Speed Pokemon. The only Pokemon that it would be able to outspeed with a Timid nature are Infernape and Gengar, and Infernape needs to be running maximum Attack and a Life Orb in order to OHKO Raikou with Close Combat. Gengar is rarely, if ever, seen as a lead nowadays, and it also has issues killing Raikou, which can OHKO it easily with Extrasensory or deal significant damage with Thunderbolt. You do lose out on the speed tie with Pokemon such as Azelf and Starmie, but neither is truly significant, and the increased power from the Rash nature allows you to score a number of important OHKOs and 2HKOs. Lum Berry is used as a way to guarantee victory against Machamp and Roserade, as well as less common leads such as Smeargle and Choice Scarf Breloom. Shuca Berry is an alternative that can be used to guarantee the win against Metagross, and also allows Raikou to serve as a Flygon lure in a pinch. However, losing 50% of the time to Machamp is an unwelcome consequence, and allowing Roserade to hit Raikou with Sleep Powder also significantly decreases its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Grass is usable if you're seriously terrified of Swampert, but in return, Raikou gives up significant coverage against top threats such as Flygon, Celebi, Shaymin, and Dragonite. Hidden Power Fire is also a pretty terribly idea, as it requires a 30 Speed IV, which forces Raikou to Speed tie base 100 Speed Pokemon. In addition, Thunderbolt is stronger than Hidden Power Fire against all but a few of the Steel-types in the game, and of the commonly seen ones, only Magnezone isn't 2HKOed by Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Optimally, Raikou's teammates should be able to deal with the few leads that Raikou performs poorly against: Swampert and Metagross. For offensive teams, Gyarados works extremely well alongside Raikou, as it is immune to Earthquakes aimed at Raikou and can soften physical blows with Intimidate. Gyarados can also setup on non-Roar Swampert and resists Metagross's Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch. Skarmory is useful on balanced teams as a partner to this Raikou, as it can use Raikou's few poor matchups to set up free Spikes against many teams. Rotom-A provides some redundant coverage, but is immune to Earthquake and can threaten the two aforementioned threats with a burn. This lead also performs poorly against Blissey, so it benefits greatly from Pokemon that are effective against Blissey, such as Scizor and Tyranitar. Scizor is a very good choice, as Raikou can support it by threatening Gyarados, which is commonly paired with Blissey on defensive teams. Raikou is also very effective against Skarmory, which is yet another common Scizor counter on defensive teams.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Aura Sphere / Extrasensory
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
nature: Rash / Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Raikou becomes an extremely effective revenge killer. With a Rash nature, Choice Scarf Raikou is capable of outspeeding top threats such as +1 Dragonite, +1 Gyarados, +1 Tyranitar, and +2 Adamant Metagross, and with its 361 Special Attack, it is more than capable of taking out all of these targets. Alternatively, Choice Specs Raikou is a powerhouse hit-and-run attacker that can come in on many defensive Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Zapdos, Vaporeon, as well as nearly every variant of Jirachi, and unleash an extraordinarily powerful Thunderbolt that's capable of 2HKOing even the great Tyranitar.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt, as always, is the most effective STAB attack for Raikou. Hidden Power Ice completes the BoltBeam coverage and allows Raikou to hit Dragonite, Gliscor, and Flygon, all of which can otherwise deal with Thunderbolt. Shadow Ball hits Rotom-A hard, and also deals the most damage to Pokemon such as Gengar and Celebi. Finally, Aura Sphere puts a beatdown on Tyranitar while still allowing Raikou to use Hidden Power Ice. Extrasensory is also an option, as it hits Machamp, Breloom, Roserade, and Heracross harder than any other attack that Raikou can use.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Again, this set uses a pretty simple EV spread: maximized Special Attack and Speed with the leftovers in HP. Aura Sphere requires the use of a Rash nature, but if Raikou is using Extrasensory instead, it can use a Modest or even a Timid nature. Modest is preferred for its power, but Timid can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Infernape and Gengar, as well as +2 Jolly Metagross.</p>

<p>Gyarados makes an excellent offensive partner for Raikou for a number of reasons. It can switch in for free on Earthquakes aimed at Raikou, while Raikou can switch in on Thunderbolts and other Electric-type attacks that threaten Gyarados. Choice Band Gyarados can also lure in common checks for Raikou, such as Shaymin and Celebi, and hit them hard enough that they are unable to come in on Raikou later in the game. Choice-locked Raikou also benefits significantly from Pokemon that can pass Wish to it, such as Vaporeon and Jirachi. Vaporeon is the preferred choice, as Jirachi's shared weakness to Ground-type attacks can make it hard for Raikou to switch in and benefit from Jirachi's Wish.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Calm Mind / Roar
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes use of Raikou's significant bulk to allow it to play a more supporting role. While mono-Electric coverage is fairly poor, this Raikou is an extremely potent counter to most special attackers, and can easily sweep once the opponent's Ground-types are removed. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk allows Raikou to absorb status for the team, and also enables it to outstall most defensive Pokemon that give other Raikou sets trouble, such as Celebi and Blissey.</p>

<p>This set comes in two main flavors: Calm Mind and Roar. Calm Mind makes Raikou a hard counter to many special attackers, including Suicune, Vaporeon, Zapdos, and Gengar. However, it leaves Raikou extremely vulnerable to Ground-types, which can switch in with absolute impunity and force out Raikou for free. Roar reduces this set's offensive prowess, but brings with it a number of advantages. Raikou's excellent Speed allows it to activate Roar through Sleep Talk and shuffle out many opponents before they can act, and it can also wear down opposing teams through entry hazard damage. Roar Raikou also acts as an ironclad counter to Pokemon like SubCM or Wish and Calm Mind Jirachi, as Raikou can come in, absorb a weak attack, and Roar it out with ease.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set are less offensively-minded, as this is a more support-oriented set. HP is maximized to provide bulk, while Speed is maximized to outrun Infernape and Gengar. Leftovers is used to keep Raikou healthy while it's asleep, and also to increase its survivability.</p>

<p>Entry hazards are especially effective alongside this set for multiple reasons. First, it's an effective counter to a ton of special attackers, and can force a lot of Pokemon out with ease. Second, if Raikou is using Roar, it can shuffle opponents around with Sleep Talk and Roar, racking up residual damage. Skarmory is the best Spikes user to pair with Raikou, as it counters many Ground-types, and Raikou can switch in on many of the special attackers that threaten it. Forretress also does well, as it can lay down both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and it can also Rapid Spin away hazards that can cause problems for Raikou. It's also a good idea to carry a Pokemon that can absorb Trick, as many special attackers are capable of crippling Raikou by Tricking it a Choice item. Flygon makes an excellent candidate, as it is immune to Earthquake and can also scout switches for Raikou to come in on with U-turn.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Raikou has a couple of neat toys that aren't viable enough for full sets but can still provide some niche usefulness. Raikou gets Reflect and Light Screen, making it a decent user of dual screens, and it can also combine Reflect and Calm Mind to reduce both physical and special damage significantly. Charge Beam can be used over Calm Mind on the offensive set for a more offensive feel. If Raikou can hit an opponent on the switch with Charge Beam and pick up a Special Attack boost, it can allow for some KOs that it wouldn't normally be able to achieve. Finally, Event Raikou can use Weather Ball on a Rain Dance set, giving it perfect accuracy Thunder as well as a Rain-boosted 100 Base Power Water-type attack to use against Ground-types.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey is the number one counter to pretty much every single Raikou set. As long as Toxic Spikes aren't up, Raikou has no chance against a healthy Blissey. The only thing that can cause problems for Blissey is either a RestTalk Calm Mind set or two layers of Toxic Spikes, but other than that, Blissey can wall Raikou, Thunder Wave or Toxic it, and then Seismic Toss it away. Tyranitar is also a solid counter to Raikou, though Hidden Power Fighting and Aura Sphere deal significant damage to it. Choice Scarf Tyranitar outspeeds Raikou and can easily KO it with either Earthquake or Stone Edge, though. Swampert walls variants of Raikou lacking Hidden Power Grass, while Flygon and Gliscor wall variants without Hidden Power Ice, and all three can eliminate Raikou with Earthquake. Snorlax may have issues switching into Life Orb or Choice Specs Thunderbolt, but it does threaten to KO Raikou with Earthquake. Hippowdon can KO Raikou with Earthquake and isn't KOed by a super effective Hidden Power. Finally, Electivire can serve as a situational counter to Raikou, as it can pick up a Motor Drive boost from Thunderbolt and hit Raikou with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes get their own mention here, as they absolutely demolish every single set other than RestTalk. Even a single layer of Toxic Spikes can cripple Raikou to the point that it can no longer sweep. Offensive Raikou doesn't last very long when it's taking 22% damage per turn, and SubCM can't stall Pokemon out with Substitute when it's losing HP instead of gaining it. Roserade is an excellent source of Toxic Spikes, as its significant Special Defense and resistance to Electric-type attacks enables it to come in on Raikou later in the match as well. Forretress can also lay down Toxic Spikes and spin away Toxic Spikes on its owner's side of the field.</p>
