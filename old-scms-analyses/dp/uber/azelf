[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Azelf may appear to be an odd Pokemon to use in Ubers, being outclassed by both Mewtwo and Darkrai in virtually all roles. However, its access to U-turn and Explosion, coupled with high Attack and Speed stats, give it a unique niche in the Ubers metagame and allow it to serve as a nimble anti-lead. When played correctly, Azelf can give headaches to many Ubers teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Azelf reaches 541 Speed, enough to outspeed most of the Ubers metagame, allowing it to serve as a decent anti-lead. With its fast U-turn, Azelf can corner faster and frailer leads such as Deoxys-S and Darkrai, while Trick can mess up bulkier leads such as Groudon and Dialga. Though it may appear that Mew is a better choice for such a role, Azelf's additional power makes all the difference. Azelf's U-turn, when coupled with standard Ubers Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, guarantees a 2HKO on max HP Deoxys-S, limiting it to one layer of entry hazards at best. Standard lead Mew does not guarantee the 2HKO, meaning Deoxys-S may be able to put up an extra layer, which can make a huge difference in the long run. Against a lead who can run different sets, like Kyogre, it is usually better for Azelf to U-turn away and use the damage done by U-turn to try and scout its set. After Azelf has taken out the opposing lead, it can set up Stealth Rock of its own, or do huge damage to the current victim with Explosion. It should be noted that having a fast Explosion is very useful mid-game, as Azelf can outspeed many sweepers and blow up on them as an emergency countermeasure; due to this utility, it is usually a good idea to preserve Azelf if possible.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ice Punch can be used over Stealth Rock, or even Trick, to allow Azelf to take down Rayquaza leads and do reasonable damage to Giratina-O. Similarly, Azelf can use Fire Punch to take out Forretress and Scizor leads.</p>

<p>Since U-turn is only used to break opposing Focus Sashes, a priority abuser is necessary to dispose of Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A to stop them from setting up more than one layer of entry hazards. Scizor is the ideal partner for Azelf, as it can finish off max HP Deoxys-S with Bullet Punch after Azelf has hurt it with U-turn. Scizor can also play mind games with a powerful U-turn of its own. Rayquaza is another good priority abuser who can immediately pressure the opponent with ExtremeSpeed or a by possibly setting up.</p>

<p>Giratina-O is virtually impervious to Azelf's attempts to dismantle it, as it resists U-turn, is immune to both Trick and Explosion, and is able to severely damage Azelf with Shadow Sneak before Azelf is able to achieve anything. Scizor leads also cause a lot of trouble since it can use Pursuit to put the hurt on Azelf as it U-turns. Choice Scarf Darkrai outspeeds and can either OHKO Azelf with Dark Pulse or put it to sleep with Dark Void. Dialga, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh are good switch-ins to Scizor, although it is usually better to set up Stealth Rock with Azelf and sacrifice it in the process, seeing as Scizor will KO Azelf with Pursuit anyway. Tyranitar, Dialga, and Lugia are good switches into Giratina-O, while a good sleep absorber like Kyogre or RestTalk Dialga is a good switch-in for Darkrai. Choice Scarf Darkrai can still threaten these switch-ins with Trick, so tread carefully when switching into it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Azelf can run a rather decent Choice Band set with U-turn, Explosion, and a combination of Ice Punch, Fire Punch, or Trick. Azelf has the second fastest Explosion in the game after Electrode (who is not usable in Ubers), and an Explosion off its 523 Attack will utterly maim, if not KO, anything that is not immune to it. A Nasty Plot set is also usable with Azelf's decent movepool, but it is heavily outclassed by Darkrai, and to a certain extent, Mewtwo. Finally, Azelf also has a range of other moves it can use, like Fire Blast, Thunder, Shadow Ball, and Grass Knot, but oftentimes they are too situational and not worth the moveslot.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Giratina-O and Ghost Arceus, are, without a doubt, the best counters to Azelf in the Ubers metagame. They are immune to both Trick and Explosion, and both resist U-turn. Giratina-O's great defenses also allow it to tank a potential Ice Punch. Scizor also counters Azelf very well, as it can Pursuit Azelf as it U-turns, potentially KOing it, although it needs to watch out for a potential Fire Punch. Choice Scarf Darkrai outspeeds Azelf and can OHKO it with Dark Pulse. Giratina leads can also defeat Azelf without much trouble, although it won't enjoy Trick.</p>
