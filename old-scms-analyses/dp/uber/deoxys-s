[Overview]

<p>Deoxys-S is in no way a bad Pokémon, but must now compete with powerful cleaners such as Deoxys-A and Mewtwo, as well as other team supporters like Deoxys-D. Still, one cannot deny the usefulness of the fastest Stealth Rock and Taunt in the game, and while its offensive stats aren't in any way comparable to powerhouses like Mewtwo or Deoxys-A, its blistering Speed and diverse movepool make it one of the best revenge killers in the game. While Deoxys-S can't sweep teams by itself, underestimating it is a very dangerous thing to do.</p>

[SET]
name: Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Taunt
move 4: ExtremeSpeed / Superpower
item: Lum Berry / Focus Sash
nature: Jolly
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Of all leads who can deploy entry hazards, Deoxys-S is perhaps the single best choice for your team. With its unmatched 504 Speed, getting Stealth Rock up is almost guaranteed, and if you're lucky, a few layers of Spikes. Taunt is a great choice in order to cripple Scarf Darkrai leads trying to sleep you, as you should be able to overcome the status thanks to Lum Berry and Taunt them, leaving them helpless as you deploy the entry hazard of choice. ExtremeSpeed is the primary option, though if you want a more powerful attack, Superpower is an option.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Shadow Ball is an option if you'd like to hit opposing Deoxys-S leads. If you decide to go that route, 252 Special Attack EVs plus a Timid nature will ensure you 2HKO all Deoxys-S running a similar EV spread. </p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screen
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Stealth Rock / Spikes 
item: Light Clay / Lum Berry
nature: Timid
EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe 

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Deoxys-S makes a fantastic lead thanks to its blistering 504 Speed coupled with a numerous amount of support options, ranging from dual screen to Stealth Rock. Taunt prevents opposing leads from setting up Stealth Rock or Spikes, as well as denying sweepers the chance to set up. </p>

<p>Light Clay is the item of choice on this set due to the fact that Deoxys-S uses both Light Screen and Reflect. Focus Sash could be used, but eight turns of Reflect / Light Screen compared to five can be a deciding factor in any match. With Light Screen up, Deoxys-S can survive many hard hits, even from boosted foes. Even Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout fails to OHKO in the rain, letting Deoxys-S set up twice 100% of the time. The decision between Stealth Rock and Spikes depends on which is needed more. Stealth Rock is generally the preferred option as it only takes one turn of setup. Still, with the highest Speed in the game, Deoxys-S is almost guaranteed to get a layer or two of Spikes up. Most of the time, Deoxys-S will be hard pressed to get three layers of Spikes up due to the power of most Uber sweepers, so it'd be preferable to get a more reliable Spikes user, such as Forretress, to complete that task.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Max Speed is essential so that Deoxys-S can outrun Hasty Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and even Rock Polish Groudon. Max HP is used to maximize both Deoxys-S' defenses. Even without Reflect, an ExtremeSpeed from a Hasty Deoxys-A will never 2HKO.</p>


[SET]
name: Mixed Offensive
move 1: Superpower
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Thunder / Grass Knot
move 4: Shadow Ball
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive
evs: 100 Atk / 172 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Offensive Deoxys-S is often cast aside by many Uber players in favor of its much more powerful forme, Deoxys-A. While it is true that Deoxys-S won't even come close to hitting as hard as Deoxys-A, its 30 points higher base Speed can make Deoxys-S a more effective revenge killer in a tier where almost nothing outruns it, including many Choice Scarf Pokémon who sit at Speeds lower than 500. Its incredible Speed makes it a great revenge killer and with its impeccable coverage can take out a surprisingly wide variety of threats in the Uber tier.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>With a Naive nature and 236 Speed EVs Deoxys-S is able to outrun Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp and anything slower. 100 Attack EVs allow Deoxys-S to OHKO Darkrai, on average; and always with Stealth Rock damage, with Superpower. They also allow Deoxys-S to 2HKO Uber Blissey (Calm, 4 HP / 252 Def) and 120 HP EV Mild Dialga. The remaining EVs were distributed to Special Attack and give Deoxys-S the ability to function as a revenge killer to some dangerous threats in the Uber metagame. Deoxys-S is capable of outrunning once Dragon Danced Rayquaza and Choice Scarf Garchomp, and OHKO with Ice Beam. An interesting note is that Jolly Rayquaza only has a 7.69% chance to OHKO Deoxys-S with ExtremeSpeed, making Deoxys-S a decent check against even those Rayquaza with ExtremeSpeed. Additionally, Deoxys-S is able to 2HKO almost all Groudon with the same Ice Beam. Thunder is for Lugia and Kyogre, both of whom are 2HKOed with Stealth Rock damage. Thunder also can be used to pick off weakened Palkia. Grass Knot is an alternative to Thunder, hitting Groudon harder than Ice Beam and still nailing Kyogre with a 2HKO thanks to Stealth Rock. Finally, Shadow Ball is mostly for Mewtwo and Deoxys-A who are 2HKOed and OHKOed, respectively, with again the help of Stealth Rock.</p>

[SET]
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Recover
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Knock Off
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Unlike the Uber Lead set, the main focus here is to get Spikes up on the field. This set is designed to effectively set up Spikes, as well as prevent foes from setting up entry hazards or sweeps.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Deoxys-S is often compared to Deoxys-D in terms of team support, and while Deoxys-D is much bulkier, its speedy counterpart claims advantages such as a faster Taunt and the ability to get more Spikes out on the field before the opponent has the chance to attack. Recover is there to enable it to stall out attacks such as Blissey's Seismic Toss, or even Lugia's Ice Beam or Giratina's Dragon Claw thanks to Pressure. Knock Off cripples walls by denying them of their precious Leftovers. Knock Off is also excellent for stripping Latias or Latios of its Soul Dew, as well as messing up Choice-reliant Pokémon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wow, this thing's movepool is insane. Counter and Mirror Coat can be used on a set, but it is still quite risky due to the hard-hitters in the Ubers environment; Deoxys-S will usually not survive an assault before it can react with a Counter or Mirror Coat. To use these moves effectively, Focus Sash is recommended. Pursuit can easily help revenge kill weak Pokémon who attempt to escape with the "can run but can't hide" tactic, however, due to Deoxys-S's relatively low Attack coupled with Pursuit's low Base Power, Pursuit isn't viable as it cannot deal sufficient damage. Psycho Boost can be used for an insanely powerful STAB attack, but due to the amount of Dark, Psychic, and Steel types in Ubers, very rarely will one find Psycho Boost to be effective. Cosmic Power is a move that Deoxys-S could use effectively, but ultimately, it's outclassed by the bulkier Deoxys-D. Deoxys-S can run a Choice set, as it indeed has the movepool, whether it be physical or special, however, diversity is one of the only reasons one would use Deoxys-S in the first place, and being locked into a single move is not ideal for a revenge killer such as Deoxys-S, so Life Orb suits it better. </p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Unlike Deoxys-A or Mewtwo, Deoxys-S doesn't have huge offensive stats. Therefore, countering offensive sets is much more manageable. Even though it has Ice Beam, Deoxys-S cannot touch Latias outside of a Choice Banded Ice Punch. Lugia can take most versions thanks to Whirlwind, and is only mildly threatened by a Choice Specs Thunder. Although they risk the rare Hidden Power Fire / Fire Punch, Scizor, Metagross, and Forretress can come in and take out Deoxys-S with Bullet Punch and Gyro Ball respectively. Dugtrio, while extremely fragile, can trap Deoxys-S with Arena Trap, giggling as it Sucker Punches it for the OHKO. Anything with Pursuit that isn't OHKOed by one of Deoxys-S's moves can be defined as a "check" as well.</p>

<p>Support sets are a bit trickier to handle, the Uber Lead set being impossible to stop without having a faster Pokémon who can OHKO or cripple it (Scarf Darkrai, Scarf Gengar, etc.). Rapid Spinners such as Forretress also shut down all attempts of Spikes or Stealth Rock, as well as being able to beat Deoxys-S 1 vs. 1.</p>
