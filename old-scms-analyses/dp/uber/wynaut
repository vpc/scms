[Overview]

<p>When looking at Wynaut, you'll probably be asking yourself why this cute little creature was banished to the forbidden land of Ubers. With terrible stats and the fact that Wobbuffet completely and utterly outclasses it, really the only reason Wynaut is banned from standard play is its access to the taboo combo of Shadow Tag and Encore. However, it does have a minor perk over its big brother Wobbuffet in that it has lower defensive stats, allowing it to activate Custap Berry faster, which, in and of itself, is a gimmick. When it comes down to it, Wobbuffet is always the better option on a serious team, but then again, why not use Wynaut?</p>

[SET]
name: Why not? (Custap Destiny Bond)
move 1: Destiny Bond
move 2: Counter
move 3: Mirror Coat
move 4: Encore
item: Custap Berry
nature: Calm
evs: 152 HP / 180 Def / 176 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>The idea behind this set is to bring Wynaut in on your opponent's revenge killer after a kill, preferably one with a Choice Scarf, and trap it with Shadow Tag. Once they're trapped, Wynaut can then appropriately use Counter or Mirror Coat to KO the opponent, and if all goes accordingly, leave itself with low enough HP for Custap Berry to activate the next turn. This will allow Wynaut to go first the next turn and take the next Pokemon down with Destiny Bond unless they use a priority move. Wynaut can also Encore a support move from a wall and give a sweeper on your team a free turn, much like Wobbuffet.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs give Wynaut maximum overall bulk, with some bias towards the special side. This will allow Wynaut to always survive an unboosted Draco Meteor from Palkia and Dialga at full health. Wynaut will also survive an Outrage from Choice Scarf Garchomp, regardless of whether Stealth Rock is up or not.</p>

<p>Since Wynaut's main attraction is his ability to trap and remove revenge killers, Pokemon that can take advantage of this are obvious teammates. Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Salamence can sweep without fear of being revenge killed once Choice Scarf Garchomp or Palkia are out of the way, as is the case for Swords Dance Lucario and Rayquaza with Choice Scarf Dialga is removed. Mewtwo and Darkrai can sweep more easily should Choice Band Scizor be eliminated, though Wynaut would be wise not to come in on a U-turn, and Rock Polish Groudon can plow through opposing teams should Choice Scarf Shaymin-S be removed. Note that Wynaut has problems taking out Choice Scarf Kyogre when it is locked into a Water-type move, so a Pokemon such as Latias or Palkia is useful to deal with it.</p>

<p>Since priority moves can take out Wynaut even after its Custap Berry has activated, Pokemon can stand up to common priority moves are ideal teammates. Dialga, Salamence, Manaphy, and Kyogre can all set up on Scizor's Bullet Punch, while Darkrai and Tyranitar can easily put pressure on a Giratina-O looking to use Shadow Sneak. Strong Steel-types, such as Jirachi and Metagross, are also useful to take on Rayquaza and Deoxys-A, common users of ExtremeSpeed. Wynaut is also stopped cold by Taunt. Common users of Taunt in the Uber tier are Deoxys-S and Mewtwo. Scizor is a good choice to take on the both of them, as it can use U-turn to put them in a checkmate position, dealing massive damage to them if they stay in, and scouting out the switch-in if they switch out. Rapid Spin and dedicated anti-leads can also stop the setup of entry hazards which will whittle down Wynaut's health. Forretress is the premier Rapid Spinner in the Uber tier, while leads like Deoxys-S, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai can all prevent the opponent getting up entry hazards reliably.</p>

<p>An interesting option would be to use Wobbuffet and Wynaut together on the same team. You can use Wynaut to take out revenge killers, while Wobbuffet can provide free turns for your own sweeper to set up. However, this is a team slot that could've been used for a more powerful sweeper, tank, or supporter.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wynaut only has eight moves in his movepool, therefore it really doesn't have any other options to run. Safeguard and Tickle are both done better by Wobbuffet.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Apart from Shed Shell, U-turn, or Baton Pass, Wynaut cannot be countered since there is no way for you to switch out. Essentially, use the same methods of dealing with Wobbuffet to defeat Wynaut. Taunt stops Wynaut cold, and putting it to sleep or Tricking a Choice item onto it will cripple it. Generally, you'll end up losing a Pokemon to Wynaut simply because it catches you off-guard. The easiest way to take Wynaut out before it uses Destiny Bond on the second Pokemon is to send in a Pokemon with access to priority.</p>
