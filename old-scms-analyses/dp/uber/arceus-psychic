[Overview]
 
<p>Once upon a glorious first generation, Psychic-types were the dominant force of the metagame, with virtually zero weaknesses, and a powerful STAB that made all cower in fear. Truly, had Psychic Arceus chosen to reveal Himself at that time, He would have been the mightiest among gods. But alas, it was not to be, for Psychic Arceus appears instead in a time when His own devious Dark- and Steel-type creations run rampant, placing His very survival in jeopardy. Competition from other Psychic-types also threatens to overshadow the prowess of Psychic Arceus; the mighty Mewtwo, born of the technologies of mere mortals, actually completely beats Arceus on the offensive front; while Lugia, the harbinger of tempests and halcyon winds alike, surpasses even its creator in defensive ability. Psychic Arceus is unquestionably formidable, but whether He can make an impact against so many others remains to be seen.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
 
<p>Psychic Arceus, like every other Arceus forme, can be an excellent Calm Mind user. Funnily enough, this ultimately comes back to bite him, as he is often considered outclassed by Dark and Ghost Arceus, both of whom sport significantly better STAB, as well as Steel Arceus, who has a better defensive typing and can beat Blissey one-on-one. Additionally, Latias, Latios, Kyogre, Mewtwo, Lugia, and Giratina-O are also usually referred to as "better" Calm Mind users, for their own reasons. This draws much from Psychic Arceus's appeal, but he's still completely viable.</p>
 
<p>Judgment is the same great, effectively 120 Base Power STAB move that all Arceus formes share. Following it, Focus Blast covers Steel- and Dark-types, hitting both super effectively, but leaves Psychic Arceus open to opposing Psychic-types. Conversely, Shadow Ball will hit Psychic-types super effectively, but leave Arceus open to Steel- and Dark-types. Finally, Recover is what sets Arceus apart from most other Calm Mind users—who can only rely on Rest for healing—by giving him a reliable recovery move with which he can take advantage of his bulk.</p>
 
[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
 
<p>Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be a decent secondary attacking move, getting reliable coverage on Steel-, Dark-, and Psychic-types, but losing out on Tyranitar. Ice Beam is also usable for its harder hit on Dragon- and Flying-types, although STAB Judgment hits most for about equal damage, while Latias and Latios are both bulky enough specially to avoid being 2HKOed by it. The EVs are such because the only legally obtainable Arceus is received at Lv. 100, meaning he caps out at 100 EVs per stat (with Vitamins). Therefore, the best way to EV Arceus is to put 100 EVs in each stat, except for the one which is least useful, here being Attack. A Timid nature is used so that Arceus can still outspeed base 90 and 95 Speed Pokemon, many of which are prominent in Ubers.</p>
 
<p>Latias can handle every other Calm Mind user that can set up on Psychic Arceus with its own Calm Mind set, but shares, along with team role, Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-type weaknesses with Psychic Arceus. Lucario has a 4x resistance to both Bug- and Dark-type attacks, allowing him to set up on Pursuits, Crunches, Megahorns, and other such things aimed at Psychic Arceus, or just hit hard off the bat with Close Combat. Darkrai causes problems for this set, so a RestTalk or Choice Scarf user such as Kyogre or Heracross would be nice. Finally, Magnezone can trap and KO Steel-types, who would wall Psychic Arceus if you opt for Shadow Ball.</p>
 
[Other Options]
 
<p>If it wasn't made clear enough, Psychic Arceus is heavily outclassed in many roles. In fact, the only reason a Calm Mind set is there is because every analysis needs at least one set. Despite being overshadowed, however, Psychic Arceus can pull off Swords Dance and RestTalk sets successfully; just know that Pokemon such as Ghost Arceus, Dark Arceus, Garchomp, Rayquaza, Groudon, and Lucario; and Steel Arceus, Ghost Arceus, Giratina-O, and Kyogre; respectively, are probably better candidates for the job.</p>
 
[Checks and Counters]
 
<p>Most Calm Mind users give Psychic Arceus a hard time, as his poor STAB and typing allow many to beat him in a Calm Mind war with a simple type advantage. Latias and Lugia, in particular, give him the most trouble, as their huge Special Defense stats, resistances to both Psychic and Fighting, and access to Recover allow them to take everything Psychic Arceus can throw at them and eventually come out on top. Non-Calm Mind Lugia can also deal with Psychic Arceus by taking a hit and phazing him out with Whirlwind. Choice Band Scizor can take most boosted attacks (besides Flamethrower / Fire Blast), U-turn out, and leave Psychic Arceus weak enough to be KOed by most things. Darkrai outspeeds Psychic Arceus, and can put him to sleep with Dark Void or smack him with Dark Pulse before he can do anything. Wobbuffet can Encore Calm Mind or even Mirror Coat Shadow Ball to beat Psychic Arceus. Specially defensive Tyranitar can take a +1 Focus Blast if it has to, and then weaken Psychic Arceus with STAB Crunch.</p>
