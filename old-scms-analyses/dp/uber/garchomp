[Overview]

<p>Do not be fooled by Garchomp's previous status as an OU Pokémon, because Garchomp is still a force to be reckoned with, even in the Uber tier. With a Choice Scarf, Garchomp is an excellent revenge killer that can stop sweeps from both Swords Dance and Dragon Dance Rayquaza. With a Choice Band, Garchomp is a fast physical powerhouse that requires no set up. Given that chance though, Garchomp can use Swords Dance to become a sweeper that can bring even Bold Lugia to its knees, single-handedly crumpling the Uber metagame with its mighty STAB Outrage. Give Garchomp the chance to sweep, and it will respond quickly with devastation, leaving only dust in its wake.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Scarf Garchomp is an excellent revenge killer and cleaner in the Uber environment. Thanks to its base 102 Speed, Garchomp can easily outrun and revenge kill almost every other Dragon-type used in Ubers. Choice Scarf Garchomp is also one of the few things that can revenge kill both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance Rayquaza, thanks to its good defenses and higher Speed. Note that if Garchomp is a team's main method of dealing with Swords Dance Rayquaza, it is advisable to try keeping Garchomp at near full health until it has KOed it, as a Swords Danced, Life Orb Adamant Rayquaza deals 80%-94% to Garchomp with ExtremeSpeed and may KO it if it has previously taken any residual damage.</p>

<p>Outrage is important for this set, because Garchomp does not have the power of Choice Band to boost its attacks, Outrage's STAB and 120 Base Power help make up for the lack of a boost. STAB Earthquake is also important for coverage, taking out Steel-types such as Dialga, and Metagross. Dragon Claw is weaker than Outrage; however, it retains Garchomp's freedom to switch out of battle if the need be. Stone Edge is the best option for the final moveslot, as it is capable of OHKOing Ho-Oh and, with Stealth Rock damage, has a chance of 2HKOing Timid Lugia. A Fire-typed move can also be used in the last slot (either Fire Blast or Fire Fang) if you are bringing sun support, to do a severe amount of damage to Forretress and Scizor. Toxic can also be used in place of Stone Edge to cripple Lugia and Groudon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If using Dragon Claw on this set, Stealth Rock support is very important. Without Stealth Rock, Garchomp's Dragon Claw cannot OHKO Palkia or Rayquaza. Steel-types such as Forretress and Scizor, can easily switch into Garchomp's Dragon-type attacks and set up entry hazards or attack, while Lugia and Deoxys-D can also switch into any attack and wall Garchomp. Because of these checks, support Dialga can be a fantastic teammate for Choice Scarf Garchomp, resisting most of the Steel-type Pokémon's attacks, and with the ability to either OHKO them with Fire Blast or set up Stealth Rock. Dialga can also cripple Lugia and Deoxys-D with Toxic. Choice Specs Kyogre can be a very useful teammate as well. Not only does Choice Specs Kyogre easily OHKO most of Garchomp's checks with its STAB, but Choice Scarf Garchomp can also revenge kill Palkia and Latias, or switch into Thunders aimed at Kyogre in return. Finally, Wobbuffet can easily switch into any of Garchomp's attacks, bar Outrage (which only has a 22% chance of 2HKOing 28 HP / 228 Def neutral natured Wobbuffet with Leftovers, even after switching into Stealth Rock), and KO with Counter. There isn't much that can be done to solve this, beyond predicting a Wobbuffet switch-in, because Garchomp will be trapped, due to Wobbuffet's Shadow Tag ability. Darkrai and Taunt Mewtwo can use Wobbuffet as set up bait, so using them alongside Garchomp is not a bad idea.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Garchomp's main advantage over Rayquaza as a Swords Dance sweeper is its Speed. Seven base points may not seem like much, but outspeeding Hasty Palkia is invaluable. It also gives Garchomp a chance of decimating most Latias who don't invest heavily in Speed. The lack of ExtremeSpeed is rather unfortunate for Garchomp, but with its bulk, typing, and ability, it's still very viable. Immunity to Thunder also allows Garchomp to potentially switch into Choice Specs Kyogre and obtain a free Swords Dance while Kyogre switches out.</p>

<p>After a Swords Dance, and with the power boost of Life Orb, Garchomp is nearly unstoppable offensively; being able to outspeed a large portion of the Uber metagame and outright OHKO even Support Groudon, one of the most physically defensive Pokémon in the tier, after 3 layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock. This, added to a STAB Earthquake with which to wreck grounded Steel-types, such as Dialga and Metagross, that are able to take a boosted Outrage, and you'll realize that there are very few Pokémon left that can be relied on to defeat Garchomp.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Some other item options that also work well when using Swords Dance Garchomp are Haban and Yache Berry; the former allows Garchomp survive any Dragon-type move from a faster Dragon-type Pokémon, bar Draco Meteors from Soul Dew Latias and Latios, and KO them, while the latter works in a similar manner, but with Ice-type attacks. It is worth noting that Garchomp is still OHKOed by a Choice Specs Kyogre's Ice Beam even with a Yache Berry. Also note that OHKOs on Groudon and Lugia are lost if you use any other item besides Life Orb, and will require entry hazard support to be reattained.</p>

<p>Dragon Claw is a useful option over Outrage if being locked into one move is a problem for you. The Base Power is an issue, however, and it can lose some important KOs; for example, Giratina is only 2HKOed by Dragon Claw after a Swords Dance, but an Outrage with the same boosts easily OHKOes it. If you are using Life Orb, this will become less of an issue, because it will often resecure such KOs with Stealth Rock support. Fire Fang is an option over Stone Edge if your team has ways of dealing with Lugia, as Fire Fang can OHKO Forretress and Scizor, as well as Skarmory with Stealth Rock, if it is not raining.</p>

<p>Wobbuffet is an excellent teammate for Swords Dance Garchomp for a number of reasons. Thanks to Shadow Tag, Wobbuffet can trap and KO Choice Scarfed Dragon-types with either Mirror Coat or Counter, eliminating one of the main barriers to Garchomp's sweep. Wobbuffet can also help Garchomp set up a Swords Dance with Encore. Additionally, Wobbuffet can use Tickle to lower Lugia's Defense. After two Tickles, Choice Band Tyranitar can OHKO Lugia with Pursuit as it switches. With Lugia gone, Garchomp will have a much easier time sweeping, and can more comfortably opt to run Fire Fang. Scizor is a helpful partner that can beat offensive Mewtwo who lack Fire-type moves. Choice Scarf Heracross and Sleep Talk Kyogre can switch into the faster Darkrai's Dark Void. Even with Garchomp's 102 base Speed, many Ubers still can outspeed and OHKO it. Therefore, paralysis support can be helpful for stopping faster foes from disrupting its sweep. This is especially true when Garchomp is not running a type-resist Berry. Lugia is a good choice for paralysis support, as it often lures in Mewtwo and Darkrai, and can promptly cripple them with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave Kyogre is another good choice, because it can lure in Choice Scarf Palkia and Latias.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Garchomp makes a fantastic user of Choice Band in the Uber environment. With 333 Speed and 538 Attack, not a whole lot can switch into this set safely. Opponents expecting the Choice Scarf variant will be surprised when Earthquake 2HKOes many of the set's common switch-ins, particularly Scizor and Wobbuffet. Earthquake will also OHKO most Dialga (unless it has used Bulk Up once) and any other grounded Steel-type in Ubers. Outrage is an excellent clean-up attack to use once the main threats to Garchomp have been eliminated, and can even 2HKO Support Groudon after Stealth Rock. Outrage should always be used with extreme caution though, because once it is used, Garchomp cannot switch out and is forced to use it repeatedly.</p>

<p>Stone Edge is Garchomp's best move against Lugia, and although Garchomp should not square off against Timid Lugia, Bold Lugia will be 2HKOed by Stone Edge after Stealth Rock. As with the Choice Scarf set, Dragon Claw is useful for finishing off weakened Pokémon without any of the issues of the other moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set has issues with faster Pokémon with super effective moves; specifically Mewtwo, Darkrai, Latias, Latios, and any Dragon-type with a Choice Scarf. The Uber Trapper Scizor is a good Pokémon to use to deal with these threats, as it is able to switch into any Choiced Dragon-type move, and then Roost away the damage, predict a switch and use Pursuit, or use U-turn to scout the next switch-in. Scizor can also beat Darkrai if Sleep Clause is in effect, in addition to checking offensive Mewtwo and Latias that lack a Fire-type move or Thunder. Heracross is another viable teammate for Choice Band Garchomp, because Heracross can absorb Darkrai's Dark Void and also switch into a defensive Mewtwo's Will-O-Wisp, thanks to its ability, Guts. Finally, Choice Band Tyranitar can easily defeat both Latias and Latios, thanks to the Special Defense boost granted by Sand Stream. The sandstorm it brings also makes Choice Band Garchomp harder to beat, thanks to the evasion boost that Sand Veil grants it.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSalac
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Dragon Claw / Outrage
move 4: Earthquake
item: Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
ivs: 30 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set allows Garchomp to safely Swords Dance without as much prediction, thanks to Substitute. Behind the Substitute, feel free to use Swords Dance until the Substitute breaks. Once the Substitute is broken, repeat the process until the Salac Berry activates, then Garchomp is ready to sweep. Dragon Claw allows Garchomp to switch attacks, ensuring that Garchomp is not stopped cold by most Steels. Outrage is still a worthwhile secondary choice, however. Because Garchomp will be at low HP after the Salac Berry activates, Outrage is worth considering due to its higher Base Power over Dragon Claw. Even with a Swords Dance, there are a number of Pokémon Garchomp will still be unable to KO with either of its other attacking moves. Outrage offers the strongest alternative possible, at the risk of being walled after using it. Whichever Dragon-type attack you choose, Earthquake is the best move to pair with it, offering the most additional coverage and STAB. Stone Edge isn't worth considering on this set; you lose the guaranteed OHKO on Lugia, but Dragon and Ground offer far superior coverage than any other combination, and you still maintain a slim chance of OHKOing Lugia with Outrage after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Much like the Swords Dance set, SubSalac Garchomp has a much easier time sweeping with Wobbuffet as a teammate. Bold Lugia can use his combination of Reflect, Roost, and Ice Beam to defeat Garchomp, since Garchomp is no longer using Stone Edge. Choice Band Tyranitar will easily KO a fleeing Lugia after Wobbuffet Tickles it twice, providing Garchomp with a much easier opportunity at sweeping. Wobbuffet can also use Encore to help Garchomp set up, while Tyranitar's Sand Stream will boost its evasion, making it even more difficult to take down.</p>

<p>Due to Garchomp using Substitute to lower its HP for a Speed boost, users of priority moves can be a problem after Garchomp's Substitute is broken. The main users of priority moves in Ubers are Rayquaza, the Deoxys formes, Scizor, and Lucario. It is best that these threats are KOed before you try and set up SubSalac Garchomp. Choice Scarf Magnezone can be a useful teammate because of this, as it can revenge kill Rayquaza who lacks a Speed boost and trap Lucario and Scizor. However, Groudon can easily set up on Magnezone locked into Thunder. When using Magnezone, rain or sun support are welcome additions to boost Thunder and Hidden Power Fire respectively. Gengar is a great teammate for Garchomp as well. Gengar can easily lure in Scizor and OHKO it with Hidden Power Fire. Gengar also has the option of using Hidden Power Ice to OHKO Rayquaza. With Stealth Rock support, Rayquaza will be OHKOed by Life Orb Gengar's Icy Wind as well, allowing the use of Hidden Power Fire with it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Garchomp's movepool isn't massive compared to other Uber Pokemon. The moves listed are best choices for Garchomp in most scenarios.</p>

<p>On the Choice Band or Choice Scarf sets, Crunch is a reasonable option over Stone Edge. Crunch can still 2HKO Lugia on the Choice Band set, while giving Garchomp a safer alternative against the omnipresent Psychic-types in Ubers. Given that Garchomp has better overall defenses than Swampert, running a defensive set that utilizes RestTalk or Stealth Rock may seem like a viable option, but Dialga is generally the better choice for this, as Dialga has no 4x weaknesses and has better defenses than Garchomp.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Timid Lugia is the best check for Garchomp. It can live by using Reflect, Roosting off the damage, and scaring Garchomp off with Ice Beam. However, Timid Lugia needs to watch out for Choice Scarf Garchomp's Stone Edge, as it will be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Groudon must invest heavily in HP and Defense in order to be a buffer against Garchomp. Unfortunately, Groudon is still at risk of being 2HKOed from a Swords Danced Outrage, while Thunder Wave will not paralyze Garchomp, thanks to its Ground-typing. Cresselia can easily switch into Garchomp that lack Swords Dance and retaliate with Ice Beam. Moonlight's recovery is boosted by Groudon's Drought, allowing Cresselia to more efficiently take hits from Garchomp. Skarmory and Bronzong can switch into Garchomp, especially because the vast majority of Garchomp lack Fire Fang or Fire Blast. Metagross can switch into a locked Outrage and KO Garchomp with Ice Punch.</p>

<p>Many Pokémon can rely on their high Speed in order to revenge kill Garchomp. Keep in mind that the Choice Scarf set is an exception. Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Deoxys-A carry moves that threaten to OHKO Garchomp. Mewtwo commonly has Ice Beam to dispose of Garchomp quickly and also access to Will-O-Wisp and Reflect. A combination of Darkrai's STAB Dark Pulse, Dark Void, and Bad Dreams will usually force Garchomp to switch out. Deoxys-A can easily scare Garchomp off with Ice Beam, but cannot switch into Garchomp at all. Deoxys-S can always outpace Garchomp, with enough Speed investment, and bring it down with Ice Beam. For the non Choice Scarf sets, Latios, Latias, and Choice Scarf Dragon Pokémon can revenge kill Garchomp. This can be risky though, because Haban Berry Garchomp will survive any of the faster Dragon-type attacks, bar a Draco Meteor from Soul Dew Latios or Latias. For any user of Ice Beam, 269 Special Attack minimum is required in order to OHKO Garchomp.</p>

<p>Sand Veil makes countering Garchomp difficult. Because Sand Veil reduces Ice Beam's accuracy to 80%, it may sometimes miss, resulting in Garchomp gaining a KO. Dark Void suffers an accuracy cut from 80% to 64%. Thankfully, Rayquaza's Air Lock prevents Sand Veil from screwing up ExtremeSpeed's accuracy.</p>
