[Overview]

<p>Latios is one of the strongest sweepers in the entire Ubers tier. His signature item, Soul Dew, boosts his already great Special Attack to stupendous amounts, allowing him to OHKO or 2HKO near anything with the correct move. Soul Dew also grants him a special defense boost, meaning that he can easily switch in to non-super effective special hits (as well as the ubiquitous Earthquake courtesy of Levitate) to easily set up or just KO something with his astonishingly powerful Draco Meteor attack. Latios also outspeeds a huge portion of the Uber metagame, which just makes him even more of a threat.</p>

<p>Despite his great power, Latios is not perfect. His typing afflicts him with weaknesses to common Uber attacking types such as Ghost-, Dark-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks. That Dark-type weakness makes him vulnerable to Pursuit, meaning that he is easily removed by trappers such as Scizor and Tyranitar. He also won't be getting past Blissey anytime soon either. Furthermore, he has to compete with Latias often for a team slot, as his sister is usually easier to fit in a team thanks to her superior bulk. Despite these flaws, Latios is still a great Pokemon to consider using in any Ubers team.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Latios is an amazingly powerful sweeper in the Uber environment. After a single Calm Mind, Latios reaches a jaw-dropping 808 Special Attack stat, and is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing most of the commonly seen Uber Pokemon. This combined with a base 110 Speed stat gives you one frightening sweeper.</p>

<p>Dragon Pulse is a crushingly powerful attack, 2HKOing literally any Pokémon who is not Blissey or a Steel-type. Grass Knot's Base Power climbs to 120 against Kyogre and Groudon, easily OHKOing them both. Grass Knot also 2HKOes Tyranitar, a popular counter to this set. Thunder is also an excellent option over Grass Knot, if one does not fear Tyranitar. Thunder allows Latios to OHKO Lugia and most Scizor, Ho-Oh, and Forretress after Stealth Rock damage and one Calm Mind. You also have the ability to 2HKO Metagross and Heatran without any boosts at all. Most Groudon are OHKOed by Dragon Pulse after one Calm Mind as well. Recover is the preferred option in the last slot so Latios can heal himself while setting up Calm Minds. If one would prefer to OHKO Scizor in the sunlight, one may use Hidden Power Fire over Recover. However, Latios may not get as many chances to set up without Recover to help it stay alive, and the drop in its Speed IV will make it slower than other Latios lacking Hidden Power Fire. If one does not fear Kyogre or Lugia, one may use Hidden Power Fire over Grass Knot or Thunder as well.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Latios will run into roadblocks against most Steel-types, such as Scizor, Forretress, Bronzong, and Metagross; however, all of these Steel-types hate boosted Thunders. All of them have a super effective attack with which they can hit Latios with, but Latios needs to watch out for Scizor and Metagross in particular because of Pursuit, which will assuredly KO him if he tries to switch out. Specially Defensive Tyranitar can switch in and OHKO Latios with Crunch, and has the defenses to take one boosted Grass Knot at full HP. Blissey walls Latios thanks to her huge HP and Special Defense stats and can wear him down with Toxic or cripple him with Thunder Wave. Darkrai won't like switching into an attack, but can come in on anything else, send Latios to sleep with Dark Void, and then set up for a sweep using Nasty Plot. Deoxys-D can hamper Latios' ability to sweep and take hits by Knocking Off his Soul Dew and inflicting him with Toxic status. Mewtwo and Darkrai commonly carry Trick, which will take away Latios' Soul Dew and cripple his ability to sweep effectively. Finally, Choice Scarf users, such as Garchomp, Dialga, and Palkia, can easily revenge kill Latios with their powerful STAB Dragon-type strikes. Kyogre is a good teammate for Latios because it can easily check most Steel-types, thanks to it resisting their STAB moves, and being able to smash them with powerful STAB Surfs. Kyogre can also destroy Tyranitar quite easily with Surf, and a Rest + Sleep Talk set with Calm Mind is able to set up on Blissey and Deoxys-D, take status attacks aimed at Latios, and can absorb Darkrai's sleep and do fatal damage back with Surf. Kyogre also provides rain support should Latios want to use Thunder. Scizor is also a good answer to Darkrai, OHKOing it with U-turn (Just be careful because Scizor can't stand up to a +2 Focus Blast). Furthermore, since Scizor usually carries a Choice item itself, it can come in on a predicted Trick Darkrai and Mewtwo and can force them out, also while dealing good damage with Pursuit (This is not always worth it, however, because losing your Choice Band hampers your attacking power.). Scizor can also come in on any of Latios' weaknesses, and is capable of dealing with Tyranitar via Bullet Punch and Blissey via Superpower. Wobbuffet can revenge kill any Choice Scarfer, sans Darkrai, by trapping them with his Shadow Tag ability and sending their attacks back at them with Mirror Coat and/or Counter. Wobbuffet can also use Encore to help create an opportunity for Latios to come in and set up. Should Latios get KOed by Pursuit, Lucario can switch in and set up for practically free, due to its has a 4x resistance to Dark-type attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set eschews Calm Mind in lieu of being capable of posing an offensive threat right from the start. Draco Meteor is a ridiculously strong attack, as it severely hurts any Pokémon who does not resist it besides Blissey, and it is capable of OHKOing Mewtwo without any prior damage. Grass Knot easily OHKOes Groudon and most Kyogre while also doing significant damage to Tyranitar. Thunder covers Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Manaphy, and also 2HKOes most of the Steel-types in Ubers. Recover allows Latios to live longer to deal more damage. Hidden Power Fire is also a usable option, as it easily OHKOes Scizor and Forretress while giving Latios a way to reliably hurt Steel-types in the sun; however you must watch out, as the drop in Speed will make you lose to other Latios. Dragon Pulse may also used if you want a STAB attack that deals consistent damage, making Latios more usable as a late-game sweeper.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set is very, very hard to switch into due to Latios' sheer power and excellent type coverage. Unfortunately, Blissey can still switch into this set with impunity and throw a debilitating Toxic or Thunder Wave at Latios. Tyranitar can come into any attack, except Grass Knot, and OHKO Latios with Crunch, or it can use Pursuit to KO Latios should it flee from the field of battle. Without Hidden Power Fire, Scizor can come in and 2HKO Latios with a Choice Band Bullet Punch or OHKO with U-turn while not being OHKOed in return by Thunder (Scizor can't switch in on Thunder however, as it is 2HKOed). Scizor has Pursuit with which to chase down Latios as well. After using Draco Meteor once, Wobbuffet can hop in and trap Latios with Shadow Tag, rendering Latios trapped and easy pickings for Mirror Coat. Lucario is an excellent counter to Blissey, as it takes little damage from most of her attacks and is immune to Toxic, and can set up on Blissey using Swords Dance. Lucario can also switch in on Tyranitar's Dark-type attacks, thanks to its 4x resistance, and drop it with one Close Combat (Keep in mind that Lucario is pretty frail). Groudon is an excellent answer to Blissey, Tyranitar, and Scizor, fearing nothing at all from them, thanks to its great defenses and it can destroy all three of them with a powerful STAB Earthquake. Wobbuffet is uncounterable thanks to its Shadow Tag ability, which stops your Pokémon from switching out. However, a mixed Expert Belt Dialga or Lustrous Orb Palkia can help you out, as they are able to bluff a Choice item, which will preserve the unpredictability of whether you will use a physical or special move, allowing you to wipe out Wobbuffet.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens + Memento
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Memento
move 4: Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse
item: Light Clay
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set, contrary to the other Latios sets, is not based on sweeping; instead, it is based on Latios's ability to set up another Pokémon for a sweep. This set works exactly how you would think: you bring in Latios and then set up both Reflect and Light Screen. With Light Clay the two moves will each last 8 turns, including the turn in which you used it. After Reflect and Light Screen are up you have the option to use Memento, which causes your Latios to faint, but also lowers your opponent's Attack and Special Attack by two stages each. After your opponent's Pokémon is completely crippled, you're free to bring in a brand new Pokémon. In most cases, bringing in a sweeper or a Baton Pass Pokémon to set up a sweep is a good strategy.</p>

<p>The EVs and nature should be fairly straightforward. Timid with 252 EVs in Speed will make sure that you're fast enough to set up on most Pokémon, while the 252 HP EVs give Latios the bulk he needs to run this set. Light Clay is the best option for an item, as it greatly extends the duration of the two screens. An attacking move is used in the last slot so that Latios isn't rendered useless by a faster Taunt-user. Even with no Special Attack investment, Latios' Draco Meteor off its impressive base Special Attack stat will dent most Pokémon who don't resist it. The Special Attack drop is not too worrying as this Latios set likes to switch in and out a lot anyway. If you prefer more consistent damage, Dragon Pulse is also another STAB move that you can use, if you don't want to lower your Special Attack. Similarly, if you would like to lure in and remove Scizor, Hidden Power Fire is a usable option as well. Safeguard is also a viable option to prevent your switch-in from being hit with a status infliction.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set works best on an offensive team with powerful, hard to stop sweepers who take advantage of the added protection of the dual screens. Mew is an excellent teammate for this Latios. With the added protection of Latios' screens and the attack-lowering effects of Memento, Mew can easily boost it stats with Rock Polish and Swords Dance/Nasty Plot, and then pass them to a deadly sweeper, such as Groudon or Dialga, turning them into nigh impossible-to-stop offensive juggernauts; Mew can also find excellent boost recipients in Substitute users, such as Mewtwo and Giratina-O, who only need one turn to pose an enormous threat to your opponent. Pokémon such as Rayquaza, Lucario, or Darkrai will work excellently alongside this set, as the added protection of Reflect and Light Screen allows them more opportunities to stat up as well as making them tougher to revenge kill.</p>

<p>This set tends to force a lot of switches, so having entry hazard support alongside this Latios is a great idea. Stealth Rock can be provided by Groudon (who can also stop Scizor and Tyranitar that may want to Pursuit you). Deoxys-S is a great lead for a team with this set that provides Stealth Rock and Spikes. Forretress can provide all three of the entry hazards and also resists all of Latios' weaknesses.</p>

[SET]
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Thunder / Grass Knot
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
item: Soul Dew
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Using Dragon Dance on something like Latios may seem silly at first, considering that Latios only has a modest base 90 Attack stat, but Latios can actually use Dragon Dance's Speed boost to deadly effect. After one Dragon Dance, Latios hits 525 Speed, allowing him to outspeed and KO all of his normal revenge killers—Darkrai, Mewtwo, common Choice Scarf users such as Dialga, Palkia, Kyogre, and Garchomp, and the standard Kingdra in the rain—before going on to smash through the rest of the opponent's team. With Latios's great bulk, resistances to Grass-, Water-, Fire-, Electric-, and Fighting-type attacks, and an immunity to Ground-type attacks, he isn't short on opportunities to switch in and grab a boost.</p>

<p>Dragon Pulse, backed by STAB and Soul Dew, will score an OHKO or a 2HKO on anything that isn't Blissey or a Steel-type. Thunder OHKOes Kyogre, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Manaphy after they have taken Stealth Rock damage. It also 2HKOes most Steel-types, including Scizor, Metagross, Heatran, and Forretress. Hidden Power Fire allows Latios to fry Scizor and Forretress, while 2HKOing any Steel-type not named Heatran or specially defensive Jirachi in the sunlight. Grass Knot is also a viable option over Thunder, as with it, Latios will OHKO Groudon and Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage. It also 2HKOes any Tyranitar variant. However, using Grass Knot means that you lose coverage against Steel-types in the rain, so only use it if your team is centered around sunlight.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are several other somewhat viable moves that Latios can run on this set. Recover allows Latios to live longer, and after a second Dragon Dance, Latios will outspeed everything in the game aside from Choice Scarf Deoxys-S. However, since Latios is not using Calm Mind to boost his Special Attack, he needs the type coverage provided by using three attacks. Surf can be used over Hidden Power Fire if using a rain-centric team. Heatran is always OHKOed by Surf, while Tyranitar and most other Steel-types will be 2HKOed. Dropping Hidden Power Fire also means that Latios does not have to lower his Speed IV. Thunder will usually do enough damage to Steel-types, though, and running Hidden Power Fire means that Latios will not lose coverage on Steel-type Pokemon in the sunlight. Draco Meteor can be used to muscle past Pokemon that Dragon Pulse may not fell in one shot, such as Dialga and defensive Groudon, but the Special Attack drop will force Latios to switch out. Outrage can also be used to 2HKO Blissey after a Dragon Dance, assuming Stealth Rock is up. If you do opt for Outrage, it should be used alongside a Hasty nature. Latios becomes vulnerable to being revenge killed after locking himself into Outrage, so it should only be used as an absolute last resort to KO the fat pink blob.</p>

<p>This set works best with entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes to achieve important KOs. Stealth Rock and Spikes can both be set up by Deoxys and Forretress. Froslass is also a good user of Spikes, while Dialga and Groudon can set up Stealth Rock reliably.</p>

<p>Latios has a hard time with Blissey, who can take all of Latios's special attacks with ease and cripple him with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Tyranitar hates Grass Knot and Surf, but can come in on anything else and eat Latios with his STAB Crunch. Defensive Jirachi can survive Hidden Power Fire in the sunlight and paralyze Latios with Thunder Wave. Defensive Dialga is a slight issue as well, as Latios cannot OHKO it with Dragon Pulse, despite the fact that he can't be OHKOed back. Wobbuffet can handle a Dragon Pulse and KO Latios with Mirror Coat. Finally, Scarf Mewtwo and Darkrai pose problems for Latios. Although neither can OHKO him, they both outspeed Latios after a Dragon Dance boost and steal his Soul Dew with Trick, thus neutering his offensive power. Scizor is a great partner for this Latios set as a response to Blissey, Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Mewtwo and Darkrai. Scizor also lures in Fire-type attacks that Latios can easily set up on. Tickle Wobbuffet can trap Blissey and proceed to Tickle away her Defense stat, enabling a follow-up Pursuit OHKO. Groudon is the epitome of a Tyranitar counter thanks to its huge Defense stat and STAB Earthquake. It can also switch in on defensive Jirachi with impunity and provide the sunlight that Latios's Hidden Power Fire so desperately needs. Mixed attackers are great to pair with Latios as they make great lures for his counters. Dialga, in particular, fills this role admirably by using an Expert Belt to feign a Choice item. Latios also covers both of Dialga's weaknesses, meaning that he can come in and Dragon Dance once Dialga has removed Latios's primary counter.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>In the manner of EVs, usually Latios is going to want max Speed with a Speed-boosting nature, as it needs to be as fast as possible to sweep effectively. However, you can run less Speed if you want. There really is no Latios that should be used with lower than 307 Speed. In fact, Latios generally shouldn't be used with lower than 330 Speed. However, if the user feels that Palkia is no threat at all, and would like to conserve Latios' EVs and nature for something else, he/she may want to go with 307 Speed, which requires 204 EVs if Latios has a neutral Speed nature. Next is max Speed with a neutral nature (319 Speed, 252 EVs). This allows Latios to outrun maximum Speed Jolly Rayquaza and tie with other max Speed neutral Speed natured Latios and Latias. After that, one might as well go to 330 Speed, which requires 176 Speed EVs with Timid nature to outspeed a max Speed Hasty or Timid Palkia. 320 Speed does absolutely nothing but outspeed an opposing neutral nature Latias or Latios. Next is 334 Speed, which requires 192 Speed EVs with a positive nature, if one is paranoid of Garchomp in Ubers. This Speed also allows Latios to outrun a max Speed Adamant Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Latios can also outspeed a neutral max Speed Arceus with 216 EVs in Speed, putting him at 341 Speed in the stat.</p>

<p>Roar could work on a Calm Mind or Psych Up set, but Latias is better for that, thanks to her higher Special Defense. Heal Block looks interesting on a set with Toxic to kill Blissey, but only use this with Aromatherapy or Safeguard to keep your opponent from killing you with a Toxic of their own. Heal Block can also be used with a set that just uses brute force against the opponent (like the all-out attacker set) to keep Blissey from walling you for long. Refresh can be used on the Calm Mind set to guard Latios against status. However, when using Refresh, Latias is usually better due to her superior bulk and ability to switch into more threats. </p>

<p>Trick is possible with Choice Scarf, allowing Latios to become a revenge killer of sorts, especially helpful against common threats like Dragon Dance Rayquaza. Blissey will detest Choice Scarf, which could well open a sweep for the likes of Kyogre easier. However, Latios won't like being without Soul Dew.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If Blissey has Toxic, she will always beat a Latios without Safeguard, Refresh, or Psycho Shift. Even if he has Safeguard, Icy Wind can allow Blissey to get in a Toxic before Latios can refresh the Safeguard after it expires the first time. Thunder Wave Blissey can be annoying, as being fully paralyzed can spell your doom if Blissey also has Seismic Toss. Psych Up / Calm Mind Blissey with Ice Beam has a high probability of beating Latios as well.</p>

<p>Metagross is a great counter, thanks to its resistance to Dragon Pulse, Grass Knot, and Ice Beam, meaning that it really only has to worry about Thunder and Hidden Power Fire. It will OHKO Latios with a Choice Band Meteor Mash or a Choice Band Pursuit on the switch. Scizor works in much the same way as Metagross, though it is more vulnerable to Hidden Power Fire. Forretress can set up entry hazards against Latios if he lacks Hidden Power Fire. Bronzong can set up Light Screen to lessen the power of Latios' attacks and it can wear the Eon Pokemon down with Payback. Dark- / Bug-type Arceus can stop Latios in much the same way, but Arceus needs to be wary of letting Latios get in too many Calm Minds. Steel-type Arceus will resist a lot of Latios' attacks, much in the same way Metagross does. Tyranitar's Special Defense is boosted thanks to Sand Stream, and it OHKOes Latios with Crunch.</p>

<p>Deoxys-A, although incapable of switching into any offensive attack, can come in on Recover, Calm Mind, or any other non-damaging move, and OHKO with a Choice Band or Life Orb Ice Punch. Knock Off and Trick in general really hurt Latios, as Soul Dew is a major part of his success. Deoxys-D commonly carries Knock Off, and Mewtwo and Darkrai are common users of Trick.</p>
