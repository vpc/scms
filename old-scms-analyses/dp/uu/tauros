[Overview]

<p>In the first generation, Tauros was known as the "King of RBY"; however, due to severe changes in the game since, he now lingers in the lower tiers, where he faces stiff competition from his fellow Normal-type, Kangaskhan. While Kangaskhan has the ability to hit Ghost-types thanks to Scrappy, Tauros has higher Speed and Attack as well as Intimidate, which gives him more chances to switch into physical attacks and makes up for his lack of resistances. When used properly, Tauros can be a potent physical threat in UU.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Tauros variant is a standard offensive Normal-type. The basic premise of this set is to switch into weak physical attacks, and then choose the right move to use accordingly. Double-Edge is recommended with Choice Band in order to 2HKO sturdier physical walls such as Donphan, Slowbro, and Tangrowth; however, success is dependent on either an Adamant nature or entry hazard support. For example, a Jolly Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge will fall short of securing the 2HKO on Slowbro, dealing only 42.1% - 49.7%. However, with an Adamant nature, you have a much better chance of 2HKOing Slowbro, as Double-Edge will now deal 45.9% - 54.3%. Earthquake is a staple on this set, as it inflicts high damage to Steel- and Rock-types, who would otherwise wall Tauros.</p>

<p>The choice in the third slot is between Return or Stone Edge. Return is generally more convenient if you opt to use Life Orb, since the recoil from both Life Orb and Double-Edge can spell doom for Tauros in only a matter of turns. However, Stone Edge is recommended with Choice Band to hit defensive Ice- and Flying-types such as Walrein, Staller Moltres, Altaria, and Articuno for higher damage. Finally, Payback allows Tauros to catch Ghost-types on the switch, OHKOing most of them. However, Pursuit is always an option if you want to trap and KO fleeing Ghost-types. Using Pursuit, however, is sometimes risky, and because of its weak Base Power, healthy Ghost-types can survive if they choose not to switch. They then can use Will-O-Wisp to render Tauros useless.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are two items to choose from: Choice Band and Life Orb. Choice Band is great in tandem with an Adamant nature as it allows Tauros to muscle his way through bulky physical walls such as Tangrowth, Donphan, and Slowbro. With Stealth Rock down, Tauros has a high chance of 2HKOing Slowbro and Donphan, and a small chance of 2HKOing Tangrowth. However, it's important to note that positive-natured Scyther and Mismagius will outpace Tauros if you opt to use an Adamant nature. On the other hand, if you're not looking to break specific walls, Life Orb lets Tauros fare better against offensive teams, as it allows him to switch moves accordingly.</p>

<p>Steel- and Rock-types are major barricades to this set since they can easily switch into Tauros's STAB. Because of this, Torterra works exceptionally well alongside Tauros since he can check a good portion of the Rock- and Steel-types in the UU tier. If you want to maintain offensive pressure, Rock Polish Torterra is probably the best set to use. Dugtrio is another offensive partner to consider if you want to trap the aforementioned threats, though it's sometimes risky to switch into them due to Dugtrio's paper-thin defenses. A defensive Hitmontop with Intimidate and STAB Close Combat can fend off Tauros quite easily. Moltres can also mesh in quite well with Tauros since he can absorb Close Combat and threaten Hitmontop with Air Slash. Furthermore, Moltres can switch into a predicted Earthquake from Steel-types and Rhyperior and threaten them with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass, respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Anger Point
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Return
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Payback
item: Salac Berry / Leftovers / Liechi Berry
ability: Anger Point
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This seems like a fairly generic Substitute and boost Berry set, but there are some unique assets that make it more attractive on Tauros than others. Anger Point is a ridiculous ability if your opponent scores a critical hit on Tauros, and the idea here is to make that critical hit happen when Tauros is behind a Substitute; his Attack will then maximize, making him virtually unstoppable. This is a much more "high risk, high return" option compared to using Intimidate, but if you manage to pull it off, very little can stand up to Tauros's might. This is made much more effective with a Salac Berry, as it will allow Tauros to outspeed every relevant threat in UU.</p>

<p>The moves are identical to the first set, providing Tauros with the best possible coverage. Unlike the first set though, Double-Edge’s side effect is counterproductive for this type of strategy; therefore, Return is Tauros's main STAB move. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. Payback is more reliable than Stone Edge on this set to hit defensive Ghost-types, as everything that Stone Edge might have been used to hit previously is OHKOed by Tauros's +6 Return.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Intimidate can be used as an alternative if you find relying on Anger Point too luck dependent. It also allows Tauros to safely set up Substitutes on weak physical attacks and helps keep physical threats in check late-game if Tauros becomes death fodder. However, doing this causes Tauros to lose his perk as a SubBerry user. Using Leftovers is an option as it also allows Tauros to make one more Substitute if you find the critical hit rate too low. Liechi Berry can be used as a backup in case Anger Point doesn't activate.</p>

<p>Dugtrio is highly recommended to pair alongside this set, even more so than with the first, since Steelix can repeatedly use Roar to completely foil Tauros's strategy. As mentioned in the All-Out Attacker set, Dugtrio's paper-thin defenses makes it difficult to switch him in; therefore, pairing it with a solid U-turn user like Uxie would work well. Tauros is nearly impossible to stop if Anger Point is activated; however, should his ability not activate, Tauros may become more of a liability. To ensure Tauros's ability activates, pairing him with a Wish user such as Leafeon or Clefable is highly recommended. Tauros also highly dislikes status effects, so using him alongside a Heal Bell user such as Chansey or Altaria can prove to be useful as well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Body Slam can be used as another STAB option if you want to spread paralysis; an Adamant nature would work well with this move to compensate for the loss in power. Zen Headbutt can be used if you want to hit Weezing and Venusaur super effectively and potentially score a flinch, but it is very unreliable due to accuracy and type coverage issues. Surprisingly, Tauros has access to a slew of special moves, most notably Fire Blast, but his low Special Attack stat makes these moves completely useless. Tauros can run a defensive spread with a set of Rest / Sleep Talk / Return / Earthquake, but he ultimately has better things to do than absorb hits. Endeavor can also be spaced in on the Angry Bull set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steelix, Rhyperior, Omastar, and to a lesser extent Registeel, can take Tauros's hits quite well and hit back with with their respective STAB moves. Defensive Ghost-types like Spiritomb, Rotom, and Mismagius make excellent switch-ins to Tauros as well since they are immune to Return and the latter two Earthquake. They can also cripple Tauros with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p>Without a Choice Band, Tangrowth and Slowbro can take on Tauros; Tangrowth can severely hurt him with Leaf Storm or cripple him with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore, while Slowbro can do the same with Thunder Wave. A defensive Donphan can take on Life Orb Tauros as well. Defensive Fighting-types like Hitmontop can weaken Tauros's physical hits with Intimidate and strike back with Close Combat or Mach Punch. A defensive Hariyama can take on Tauros who lack Choice Band and hit back with Force Palm, potentially paralyzing Tauros. If facing the Angry Bull set and Tauros's ability activates, your best bet would be to combat him with priority moves from Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Azumarill, or Absol; otherwise it's game over.</p>
