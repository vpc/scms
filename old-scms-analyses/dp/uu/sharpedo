[Overview]

<p>Sharpedo's excellent offensive stats and decent Speed make him an effective sweeper in UU. This is complemented by his decent movepool and reliable STAB moves. Sharpedo's main downfall is his awful defenses and poor defensive typing, giving him weaknesses to common Grass-type moves, as well as common Fighting-type moves like Mach Punch. This is disappointing, as Sharpedo works excellently when it's being used against crippled or weakened opponents or hiding behind a Substitute.</p>

[SET]
name: Attacking Lead
move 1: Crunch
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Aqua Jet
move 4: Taunt / Earthquake / Ice Fang
item: Focus Sash
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sharpedo is an effective lead in UU as he can hit the opponent with his powerful STAB attacks and proceed to finish them off with Aqua Jet. Rhyperior leads are KOed with Waterfall followed by Aqua Jet, while Crunch has a chance to 2HKO Uxie and OHKO Alakazam (or 2HKO Focus Sash versions with Crunch followed by Aqua Jet). Taunt is the best option in the final slot as it shuts down lead Cloyster, who causes problems due to his huge physical defense and his typing, which gives him a resistance to Water-type moves. Earthquake allows Sharpedo to hit Registeel, while Ice Fang deals huge damage to Altaria and Torterra switch-ins. Focus Sash is the ideal item as any attack is likely to KO Sharpedo.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs focus on Sharpedo's Attack, giving his physical moves more power. 252 Speed EVs aren't used to outrun a specific threat; they are used because Sharpedo's defenses are not worth investing in.</p>

<p>Ambipom leads cause Sharpedo problems as Fake out will deal a large amount of damage, and his high Speed allows him to attack again before he can hit back; Aqua Jet is unable to KO Ambipom after he has used Fake Out, making Sharpedo easy to defeat. Spiritomb also causes Sharpedo problems as his great defenses make him take little damage from any of Sharpedo's attacks, while he can hit Sharpedo super effectively with Hidden Power Fighting and finish him off with Sucker Punch. Registeel is a decent partner for this set as it can switch into both Ambipom and Spiritomb with ease and attempt to set up with Curse, or cripple Ambipom with Thunder Wave (providing he doesn't carry Taunt). Its great defenses mean that Registeel will take reduced damage from Hidden Power Fighting, and its Steel-typing gives it a resistance to Dark-, Ghost-, and Normal-type moves. Machoke leads also cause Sharpedo problems as he hits you super effectively with DynamicPunch and can finish Sharpedo off with Bullet Punch. Slowbro is an excellent choice to deal with Machoke leads due to his Own Tempo ability and high defensive stats; his Psychic-typing also gives him a resistance to DynamicPunch.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Substitute / Ice Fang / Zen Headbutt
item: Life Orb
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Sharpedo's excellent Attack and decent movepool, which make him a powerful physical sweeper in UU. Waterfall is the most important move on this set, dealing massive damage to Pokemon like Donphan, Regirock, and Moltres. Crunch is used as secondary STAB, hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Slowbro and Rotom super effectively. Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types like Registeel and Magneton, while dealing more damage to Aggron than Waterfall would. The final slot is down to personal preference; Substitute is the best option if you choose to use a Life Orb as it protects Sharpedo from status and critical hits, while also covering his awful defenses. Ice Fang may be used to hit Altaria and Torterra with more power, and Zen Headbutt deals more damage to the likes of Venusaur and Hitmontop.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>252 Attack EVs are used on this set to deal maximum damage with his attacks, while 252 Speed EVs are used to tie with positive base 95 Pokemon. Sharpedo is so frail that it isn't worth investing in his defenses. When using a Choice Band, an Adamant nature is recommended to deal as much damage as possible over a single turn, though Jolly can be used to outrun the likes of Rotom and tie with positive-natured Drapion and Houndoom.</p>

<p>Bulky Water-types cause problems for this set as Sharpedo is unable to hit the majority of them super effectively. Problems arise when facing Blastoise, Milotic, and Cloyster. Venusaur is an excellent partner for Sharpedo as he can switch into these threats with ease thanks to his immunity to Toxic and resistance to Water-type attacks. Venusaur can proceed to Sleep Powder or Swords Dance and sweep. Venusaur is also helpful as he absorbs Toxic Spikes, a common move on Cloyster. Torterra is another option as STAB Wood Hammer mauls the likes of Slowbro and Milotic; though he should watch out for Ice Beam. Support from Toxic Spikes is helpful as it cripples bulky walls who attempt to stop Sharpedo's sweep. These include Leafeon, Tangrowth, and non-RestTalk Spiritomb. Drapion is an excellent choice to set up Toxic Spikes due to his excellent typing and decent defensive stats. Qwilfish is another great choice as he can act as a suicide lead and explode on the opponent, giving Sharpedo a safe switch in.</p>

<p>Pokemon with priority moves-such as Hitmontop, Absol, and Scyther-cause big problems for Sharpedo as his defenses are horrible. Donphan is a good teammate to cover this, as he takes little damage from common priority moves in UU, can set up Stealth Rock, remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and hit incoming Ghosts with Assurance. He also has access to Ice Shard, dealing huge damage to Scyther, and Earthquake coming from base 120 Attack will hit anyone who doesn't resist it for serious damage.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Surf / Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Substitute / Dark Pulse
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the above set utilizes Sharpedo's impressive Attack, this set uses Sharpedo's lower Special Attack to sweep. Although this seems inferior to a physical or mixed set, this set carries surprise value, and his special movepool is equally as impressive as his physical movepool. Surf and Hydro Pump act as reliable STAB, both dealing exceptional damage to the likes of Moltres, Regirock, and Donphan. Surf is the most reliable option as Sharpedo's defenses are so horrible that he cannot afford to miss an attack; however, Hydro Pump can OHKO standard Regirock after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes have taken their toll. Ice Beam allows Sharpedo to hit Altaria, Torterra, and Tangrowth super effectively, scoring an OHKO on each. Hidden Power Grass is used to deal with Slowbro, Milotic, and Quagsire. The final slot is down to personal preference, though Substitute is recommended when you use a Life Orb due to Sharpedo's weak defenses. Dark Pulse can be used as secondary STAB, hitting Ghosts like Rotom, as well as Psychic-types like Uxie. Using an Expert Belt in place of Life Orb is an option as it helps Sharpedo bluff a Choice item, which can lure an opponent into thinking they are safe when switching into Sharpedo when they are not.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>252 Special Attack EVs ensure that Sharpedo's attacks deal as much damage as possible, and 252 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature allow Sharpedo to outrun the likes of Rotom and tie with positive-natured Drapion and Houndoom. The choice between a Timid and Modest nature depends on whether you wish for more Speed or more power.</p>

<p> Due to his lack of a physical move, this set encounters problems with special walls like Chansey. There are numerous ways to deal with Chansey, the first being a mixed sweeper acting as a lure with special attacks. Magmortar is an excellent option as he can bluff a Choice item with Expert Belt and 2HKO Chansey with Cross Chop. Another way to beat Chansey is to use a Mismagius with Taunt and Nasty Plot. After three Nasty Plot boosts, Mismagius can 2HKO Chansey with Hidden Power Fighting. Registeel will also cause problems as Sharpedo is unable to 2HKO it with Choice Specs Hydro Pump, while Registeel can cripple him with Thunder Wave and finish him off with Iron Head. Nidoking is a great choice to beat Registeel as he can switch into Thunder Wave for free due to his Ground typing and threaten Registeel with STAB Earthquake or Earth Power. Rhyperior and Donphan are also excellent choices as they can switch into any of Registeel's attacks and hit it with STAB Earthquake.</p>

<p>To ensure an OHKO against Regirock, Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes is required. Omastar is a fine choice for this role as it has a huge Defense, allowing it to set up against physical threats such as Scyther and Arcanine, while scaring away common Rapid Spinners like Donphan and Claydol with STAB Surf. Another way to set up entry hazards is to use a dedicated Spikes user like Cloyster or Qwilfish along with a defensive partner like Chansey or Donphan with Stealth Rock.</p>


[Other Options]

<p>Sharpedo has a pretty vast movepool, but most of what matters is already suggested in the sets. Super Fang is a respectable move, halving the HP of a wall who's causing problems. Agility may be useful to boost Sharpedo's Speed, allowing you to focus EVs on his offensive stats.</p>

<p>Choice items may be used in place of Life Orb for more power, though this makes Sharpedo easy to predict and will force you to switch more often. This causes problems as Sharpedo's awful defenses will make it difficult to switch in, and Stealth Rock will take its toll after repeated switch-ins.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Water-types can wall the majority of Sharpedo's attacks, barring the rare Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power. Milotic makes light work of Sharpedo, having a resistance to his STAB Water-type moves, and taking little damage from Crunch and Dark Pulse due to her great defenses. Hidden Power Grass deals a minimum of 72% to Sharpedo even without EV investment, always scoring a 2HKO. Blastoise also takes little damage from any of Sharpedo's attacks, regardless of them being physical or special. Blastoise can use this time to support his team with Rapid Spin, or cripple Sharpedo with Yawn or Toxic. Finally, Poliwrath resists Sharpedo's Dark-type moves, whilst having has an immunity to Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb. Venusaur can handle most sets, though repeated hits from Ice Beam will wear him down over time. Sleep Powder can be used to cripple Sharpedo, while Energy Ball or Power Whip will OHKO him. Hitmontop is a decent counter as he can exploit Sharpedo's low Defense with his super effective priority moves. A combination of Fake Out and Mach Punch will KO Sharpedo, while his Intimidate ability will weaken Sharpedo's physical attacks.</p>

<p>Chansey can handle most specially-based sets with her huge HP and good Special Defense, while she can beat Sharpedo with Seismic Toss and Softboiled. Lanturn also does an excellent job at countering Sharpedo who lack Earthquake, and can hit Sharpedo with STAB Electric-type moves.</p>

<p>Weezing can handle most physically-based sets with his immunity to Earthquake, huge defensive stats, and access to a variety of moves that can deal with Sharpedo. Thunderbolt will OHKO Sharpedo, while Will-O-Wisp cuts his Attack score in half. Weezing should be careful of Hydro Pump from mixed and specially-based sets, however. Cloyster can also take on any physically-based set, using his great Defense to set up entry hazards, while he can play offensively with Rock Blast or Explosion. Tangrowth is another decent choice, though his low Special Defense is an issue if Sharpedo is running some kind of mixed set.</p>
