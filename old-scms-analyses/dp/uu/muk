[Overview]

<p>Muk has probably one of the worst cases of four moveslot syndrome in history. His Poison typing and STAB are rather pitiful; Steel-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon are three omnipresent types in UU and none of them mind it. This means Muk must rely on his big movepool to hurt switch-ins, but the limit of three leftover moveslots hinders him greatly. Explosion is also such a tempting move that it sometimes leaves Muk with only two moves to make up for his bad STAB. His movepool problems aside, Muk is an excellent special tank who can take attacks from the likes of specially oriented Venusaur and Lanturn. Muk's awesome 105 base Attack should not be ignored either, as it allows him to tear massive holes in foes that don't resist his powerful Gunk Shots. Muk may seem lackluster, but he can effectively fill in a variety of roles for your team.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Muk makes a fantastic Curse user in UU due to his superb special bulk and naturally high Attack stat. Unlike other Curse users, Muk is not susceptible to Trick thanks to his ability, Sticky Hold. This allows Muk to set up Curses on common Trick users, such as Clefable and Rotom, with little fear. Poison Jab is Muk's obligatory STAB move, while the third slot gives him better coverage. Brick Break allows him to damage Steel- and Rock-types such as Steelix, Registeel, and Aggron, which usually carry Earthquake to wreck Muk's set-up. Ice Punch allows Muk to hit Ground-types which normally switch in on it, such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Claydol. For the last slot, Explosion is a powerful move that lets Muk takes out at least one last Pokemon, while Shadow Sneak allows him to hit faster Pokemon such as Espeon and Alakazam, which can threaten him with a STAB Psychic attack. Rest is another option if Muk has a couple of Curses under his belt since it allows him to replenish lost health and cure status. Gunk Shot is another option on this set for a stronger STAB attack, but it is not recommended because of its low PP and accuracy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are designed to give Muk the best balanced bulk possible with a little more emphasis on Special Defense, as Muk can simply raise his Defense with Curse. 80 Defense EVs ensure that Muk is never KOed by Hitmonlee's or Aggron's Earthquake. However, these EVs can easily be moved to either Special Defense, which gives Muk the best special bulk possible, or Attack, which gives Muk a little more power.</p>

<p>While combining Rest with Sleep Talk may seem tempting, leaving Muk with only one type of attack is a horrible idea. Muk's Poison STAB has bad coverage in UU, and his biggest counters, Registeel and Steelix, are completely immune to it. Furthermore, leaving Muk with only Brick Break or Ice Punch would leave him utterly outclassed by a multitude of Pokemon in UU.</p>

<p>This set has a hard time dealing with Registeel and Steelix due to their titanic Defense stat that allows them to take repeated Brick Breaks from Muk. Steelix can use Roar to prevent Muk from even setting up Curse, and both Steelix and Registeel can deal plenty of damage to Muk with Earthquake. Hariyama makes an excellent teammate for Muk due to his incredible base HP, which allows him to take repeated Earthquakes from Steelix and Registeel and threaten them back with STAB Fighting-type attacks. Pairing Muk alongside Milotic or Quagsire can prove useful as well. They have exceptional bulk and can shrug off attacks from the various Ground-types of UU and then threaten them with Surf or Waterfall. Muk also appreciates dual screen support, which allows him to set up with less difficulty.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Poison Jab / Gunk Shot
move 2: Brick Break / Focus Punch
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Explosion
item: Choice Band
ability: Sticky Hold
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With an impressive base 105 Attack and high defensive stats, Muk can effectively utilize a Choice Band set. STAB Gunk Shot can deal a considerable amount of damage to Pokemon that do not resist it; however, Poison Jab is the safer option due to its higher accuracy. The selection between Brick Break and Focus Punch solely relies on your prediction skills. Focus Punch deals much more damage overall; for example, it deals 62.15% - 73.45% to Relaxed 252/0 Steelix, Muk’s number one counter. Brick Break will fail to get a clean 2HKO on Steelix, but is a much more reliable option otherwise. Ice Punch deals with Grass- and Ground-types like Venusaur, Torterra, Nidoking, Donphan, and Claydol. In the last slot, Explosion is a powerful attack that literally OHKOes any UU Pokemon that does not resist it. Payback is another option in place of Ice Punch to hurt opposing Psychic-types, but Ice Punch is preferred, as it damages Ground-types who can hit Muk on his lower Defense stat with Earthquake.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be utilized to outrun Pokemon such as RestTalk Milotic, Support Venusaur, and Blastoise. It also lets Muk Speed tie with opposing Aggron and Azumarill.</p>

<p>This set may hit hard, but it is still stopped by Steel-types. Steelix and Registeel have to be careful about switching in on Focus Punch, but can otherwise easily come in on any of the other three attacks and scare away Muk with Earthquake. Nidoking and Nidoqueen can also come in on a predicted Poison- or Fighting-type attack and damage Muk with STAB Earthquake. As mentioned in the set above, Milotic can stop Muk's counters and drown them with Surf. For additional support, Spikes and Stealth Rock can help weaken Steelix and Registeel switch-ins. Good teammates to set up the aforementioned entry hazards include Omastar, Qwilfish, and Cloyster. Finally, Muk is easily revenge killed by Psychic-types such as Alakazam, so pairing Muk with a Pursuit user such as Spiritomb can greatly aid in Muk's hole-punching.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Poison Jab / Gunk Shot
move 4: Ice Punch / Payback / Explosion
item: Black Sludge
ability: Sticky Hold
nature: Adamant
evs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 40 Def / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Substitute, Muk can utilize the jaw-breaking Focus Punch to more easily smash through opposing Steel- and Rock-types. This set is quite simple to use: set up a Substitute on a Pokemon whom Muk will scare out, and then use Focus Punch if it can hit super effectively. Poison Jab is the preferred STAB attack and is Muk's most consistent form of dealing damage; however, Gunk Shot offers more power and Muk has extra time to fire it off from behind a Substitute. Ice Punch covers Grass- and Ground-types like Venusaur, Nidoking, and Donphan who resist Fighting and/or Poison. Since Muk can only achieve a 3HKO at best on these Pokemon, you may prefer Payback to maim Ghost- and Psychic-types instead. As always, Explosion is an option in the last slot to allow Muk to go out with a bang.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The somewhat arbitrary-looking EVs allow Muk to create 101 HP Substitutes and give Muk as much Attack as possible. With 8 EVs placed in Speed, Muk can outpace opposing minimum base 50s and set up a Substitute before they can status him. The remaining EVs are placed in Muk's lower Defense stat to protect him from the multitude of physical attacks found in UU.</p>

<p>As with the aforementioned sets, Steelix is a menace to Muk even when he is behind a Substitute. Steelix is only 3HKOed by Focus Punch, and in the meantime, can easily use Roar to blow Muk away or damage him with Earthquake. Again, Milotic is a good partner, able to shrug off Earthquakes and soak Steelix and other Ground-types with Surf. Because Muk will be losing a significant amount of health from using Substitute, pairing him with a Wish user, such as Clefable or Leafeon, could prove useful. Pairing Muk with a Flying-type, such as Altaria or Moltres, allows him to easily avoid incoming Earthquakes and gives his Flying friends a free turn to do as they please. Grass-types such as Exeggutor and Tangrowth are good teammates as well since they resist Earthquake and can deal with the bulky Water-types Muk has trouble getting past with this set.</p>


[SET]
name: Tank
move 1: Poison Jab / Gunk Shot
move 2: Brick Break / Focus Punch
move 3: Ice Punch / Payback
move 4: Pain Split / Explosion
item: Black Sludge
ability: Sticky Hold
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 68 Atk / 188 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set plays a little more differently than the sets above. Its aim is to handle special attacks directed at Muk while dishing out attacks with his impressive base 105 Attack. Poison Jab is the preferred move for better accuracy, while Gunk Shot provides extra power but less accuracy. Unlike the previous sets, this one does not mind the PP drop from choosing Gunk Shot. Brick Break and Focus Punch are a must to damage opposing Rock- and Steel-types who would otherwise wall Muk completely. Ice Punch is useful against opposing Ground-types and Venusaur who attempt to come in on a Poison- or Fighting-type attack. Payback is another option for hitting opposing Psychic-types who could be problematic for Muk. Pain Split is the main option for decent recovery; it can also help do significant damage to Pokemon such as Registeel if Muk is at low health and they are at high health. Explosion is another option for this set as a last ditch effort to take out an opposing bulky Pokemon, such as Hariyama or Azumarill. Giga Drain can surprise and eliminate Rhyperior, Omastar, and Kabutops on the switch, but those are the only significant targets in UU. If you decide to use Giga Drain, then a Brave nature is recommended to maximize Giga Drain's power by not lowering Muk's Special Attack. Shadow Sneak is another option on this set to cover speedy Psychic-types, but it is far too weak without a Curse boost. Fire Blast can also be used to hit Steelix on its weaker Special Defense stat, but that is the extent of its use.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Muk will have a harder time dealing with Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix without any form of a boost. Both Registeel and Steelix can shrug off Brick Break, and Focus Punch will still fail to deal any significant damage. Defensive Hariyama can be a neat partner with Muk as it can take repeated Earthquakes while dishing out incredible damage with his STAB Fighting-type move. Moltres is another potential teammate for this set because it can come in on Earthquake and attempt to scare Steel-types away with a Fire-type move. Muk will also attract Psychic-types, and the perfect choice to take Psychic-type attacks is Spiritomb. Spiritomb can utilize Pursuit on fleeing Psychic-types or set up using Calm Mind to handle bulkier Psychic-types such as Uxie and Mesprit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Besides Ice Punch, Muk also has access to ThunderPunch and Fire Punch. ThunderPunch can strike down Qwilfish, Moltres, and Scyther, while Fire Punch can roast Venusaur, Heracross, and Torterra. Memento is an extremely unorthodox move that Muk can employ in some very circumstantial cases to set up your next Pokemon, but this role is usually better done by faster Pokemon that can also set up dual screens (e.g. Uxie). Mean Look can force something to stay on the battlefield so Muk can Explode on them. Muk can also perform Haze, but Weezing usually does a better job at doing that thanks to his higher Defense stat and immunity to Earthquake. Taunt is decent since it stops Pokemon from setting up and forces Ghosts to attack so Muk can hit them with Payback while also preventing them from burning Muk. However, Muk is usually too slow to utilize Taunt effectively. Screech can force a switch, which sometimes allows Muk to fire off a free Focus Punch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Muk has a plethora of counters in UU. As mentioned in every set, Muk has a difficult time dealing with most bulky Steel-, Rock-, and Ground-types, which are all very common defensive types in UU. Steelix and Registeel in particular can prevent Muk from doing anything because of their titanic Defense stats. Muk’s only way of damaging them is a boosted Focus Punch, but it is unreliable. Nidoking, Claydol, and Nidoqueen are also troublesome to Muk because they resist Muk's STAB and Fighting-type moves. Furthermore, all three have a considerable amount of bulk to take an Ice Punch, outpace Muk, and dispose of him with their STAB Earthquake. Drapion is also another forgotten threat who can set up Swords Dance and scare away Muk with Earthquake.</p>
