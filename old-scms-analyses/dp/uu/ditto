[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Yep, this is the best Ditto set ever, seriously.</p>

<p>The only way Ditto will actually be worth it is if you can spread status around your opponent's team. Thunder Wave is a good choice because it means Ditto will be faster than your opponent after you Transform.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>To improve Ditto's chances against Download Porygon/2/Z, you should always put the last 4 EVs in Special Defense, since this causes Download to boost the foe's Attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Quick Powder gives Ditto an impressive 428 Speed, outspeeding even Choice Scarf Heracross. The only problem is that after you Transform, Quick Powder's boosts are lost. Transforming before them means you take a hit, then essentially have to fight them with no item. This means you are a turn behind and you have a worse Pokemon out thanks to the item handicap. For this reason, Quick Powder is not recommended. Metal Powder is much the same.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Ditto's best counter is a little thought. Get Ditto to Transform into something that another one of your Pokémon counters 100%, and then send in the counter. You'll want to think twice before sending in a Pokemon with Spikes, Stealth Rock, or Toxic Spikes, though.</p>
