[Overview]

<p>Sadly, Pachirisu is one of the poorer Pokémon in the game and stat-wise it's not very good at all. The combination of high Speed and Special Defense isn't very helpful; though it can help score a quick status-move (or Super Fang) on walls. The only reasons to use Pachirisu are to counter other Electric-types in the lower tiers, and utilize Super Fang to heavily weaken enemies for your other sweepers to pick off. You can't do a great deal back to the likes of Plusle and Minun, but if you can paralyze them or dig into their HP with Super Fang, they'll become almost useless. Another letdown is that both of Pachirisu's abilities are completely useless in battle.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pachirisu wasn't blessed with great stats, or a brilliant movepool, so this is probably the best use you're likely to get from it. As you're most likely aware, Pachirisu just doesn't have what it takes to use offensive moves all that well. So, we're forced to use a support set in hope of benefiting your team in some way. Pachirisu has a good Speed stat, but it's not very useful for this set (besides a fast screen set-up, Super Fang, or status).</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Light Screen is a great support move and will allow Pachirisu to take a few more hits from special attacks, giving you a better chance to be free to status a threat. Speaking of status moves, Pachirisu's best options are Toxic and Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave will help slow down sweepers, while Toxic can weaken troublesome walls. If you'd prefer to set up Light Screen and then scout for your opponents counters, you can use U-turn instead for light damage, information, and possibly a free switch. Generally, you'll want to rip into most walls with Super Fang as soon as possible, weakening them for your sweepers later on in the game. Being able to take a Pokémon down to 50% health in a single turn is one of the main reasons to use Pachirisu. Discharge is preferred over Thunderbolt, as Pachirisu won't be doing much damage, the 30% paralysis chance from Discharge can be very beneficial; especially since you won't really need to use Thunder Wave anymore (meaning you can use the brilliant combo of Super Fang and Toxic to defeat walls). Grass Knot (or Hidden Power Grass, Water, or Ice) can be used instead of your Electric attack or over either attack in slot 4. These are useful if you want Pachirisu to be able to take Ground-types down to 50% health instantly (with Super Fang) and hope to KO with a super effective attack instead of relying on Toxic.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pachirisu does have some decent moves, but sadly doesn't have the stats to use the majority of them. Thunderbolt is an option as always on Electric-types, but Discharge is preferred as the paralysis chance is worth it; you won't be doing a great deal more with Thunderbolt. As already mentioned, various Hidden Powers (mainly Grass, Water, and Ice) and Grass Knot are usable, but with 45 base Special Attack they're just not hitting hard enough. However, you could attempt to pair these moves with Fake Tears to drop your opponents Special Defense as Pachirisu doesn't really have a means of increasing its Special Attack (bar Charge Beam and Choice Specs). The only other move worthy of mention is Charm, which can be used to weaken incoming physical attackers.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Almost anything can counter Pachirisu really, since its offensive stats are abysmal. Even the majority of Water-types can survive Pachirisu's STAB attack, that's how bad it is. However, remember that if you're switching into Pachirisu, you'll be more than likely to take around 50% damage straight away. Whiscash and Quagsire can be good counters, since they are immune to Electric attacks and can destroy Pachirisu with Earthquake. They should be able to shrug off a Grass Knot too thanks to their rather low weight. Muk is slow so won't mind being paralyzed, and it's immune to Toxic. Basically, any fast physical attacker that avoids being paralyzed will deal with Pachirisu, and any bulky Pokémon with physical attacks that doesn't mind being paralyzed will also put a stop to it (it shouldn't mind getting a Super Fang either).</p>
