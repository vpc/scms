[Overview]

<p>Uxie has become one of the most prominent Pokemon of the DPP UU metagame, and for good reason. Its massive defenses, combined with its enormous support movepool, which includes (but is certainly not limited to) Stealth Rock, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Yawn, and U-turn, and high base Speed stat, have made it the quintessential support Pokemon. Not only that, but Uxie is also one of the most dangerous users of Calm Mind in the tier. The only things stopping this knowledgeable sprite from storming the upper tiers are its irritating Psychic typing, which leaves it weak to Pursuit and U-turn; its lackluster offenses, even with the boost provided by Calm Mind; and absence of reliable recovery outside of Rest. Have no fear though; if you're looking for a good lead, supporter, or late-game sweeper, your search has come to an end. Welcome the omniscient pixie into your team with arms wide open.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Uxie has a considerable amount of bulk, which enables it to take hits from many opposing Pokemon, and this set is all about tanking those hits, crippling and softening up your opponent, and setting up the rest of your team for an eventual sweep. First, you should try to bring Uxie into a Pokemon who can't possibly penetrate its impregnable defenses and proceed to use Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, or Yawn. After this mission has been accomplished, Uxie is free to U-turn as your opponent goes to their Uxie counter, and you can choose the appropriate Pokemon to switch in against it. The choice between Thunder Wave and Yawn is up to your preference. Uxie is one of the most reliable users of Thunder Wave and can cripple your opponent's faster walls and sweepers, allowing a slower sweeper, such as Rhyperior and Marowak, to come in late-game and plow through your opponent's team. Yawn works well to rack up residual damage and can potentially put a Pokemon to sleep, but, when compared to the possibility to cripple multiple Pokemon with Thunder Wave, is usually a lesser option. Psychic is Uxie's obligatory STAB move, and it helps damage the common Fighting-types in UU, especially Hitmontop, who will try to rain on Uxie's parade by spinning away Stealth Rock. Psychic also lets Uxie deal with the myriad of Poison-types in UU, such as Venusaur and Toxicroak.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Bold nature is recommended as Uxie has a weak U-turn anyway, and even with a hindering nature, Uxie is able to break Alakazam's Substitutes with it. Fortunately for Uxie, the sheer amount of sets and combinations it can run works to its advantage by ensuring that your opponent can never be too sure what exactly your Uxie is running. One of the easiest changes to make is to change the EV spread to a specially defensive one of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature. Another option is to keep the given EV spread, but instead using a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs. This will allow Uxie to take a hit and U-turn to another Pokemon as opposed to forcing the Pokemon to whom it U-turns to take a hit.</p>

<p>Uxie fares very well in the lead position, as it is able to get Stealth Rock up consistently and possibly start paralyzing the opponent's team early with Thunder Wave. If using Uxie in the lead position, the slower nature and IVs are recommended for the reasons given above. However, to ensure Uxie gets Stealth Rock up on the field, another alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used. This will lower Uxie's tanking abilities, but will allow Uxie to get Stealth Rock up against some of the Taunt leads of UU, with the exceptions of Electrode, Ambipom, Mismagius, and Alakazam, as well as allowing Uxie to paralyze opponents before they can move.</p> 

<p>Thunderbolt can be used in the last slot to deal with Water-types such as Feraligatr and Azumarill, who may take the opportunity to switch in and set up on Uxie's paltry offenses. Thunderbolt and Psychic together offer near-perfect neutral coverage in UU, but without U-turn, Uxie's ability to tank the opponent's hits and support the team is greatly diminished. Zen Headbutt is an alternative choice for STAB in order to inflict damage on sweepers who are weaker on the physical side; however, its imperfect accuracy is a turn-off. Heal Bell is an option to consider in place of either Stealth Rock or Thunder Wave. With it, Uxie becomes an effective cleric, further supporting the team. Memento is another option to consider to allow Uxie to sacrifice itself in order to safely bring in one of your sweepers and give it a free turn to set up. Sacrificing Uxie, however, takes away its ability to support the team, and should your sweeper fail to complete its sweep, Uxie will be unable to tank any more hits for your team. Finally, Uxie can make use of Knock Off to strip its enemies of their item, such as Milotic's Leftovers and Torterra's Life Orb.</p>

<p>Uxie's downfall is its lack of recovery, so pairing Uxie with a Wish user can work well to lengthen its life. Clefable and Chansey are great candidates, and as an added bonus, they attract Fighting-type attacks, which Uxie can shrug off with ease. Uxie has a tough time dealing with Dark-types, such as Houndoom and Absol. A great partner to handle these threats is Hariyama, who can handle Dark-type attacks and dish out STAB Fighting-type moves in return. Mismagius is another threat to Uxie, so having a Registeel waiting in the wings can deal solve this problem nicely by using Iron Head or Shadow Claw to break its Substitutes or Thunder Wave to render it useless.</p>

[SET]
name: TrickScarf 
move 1: Trick
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Psychic
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 32 SpA / 224 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Uxie is able to reinvent itself as a support Pokemon by checking a myriad of faster threats and, more importantly, make use of Trick in order to cripple an opposing Pokemon. Uxie's access to Trick frequently results either in the crippling of unsuspecting special walls, such as Chansey and Registeel, or in the complete shutdown of bulky stat boosters who commonly try to use Uxie as setup fodder, such as Houndoom and Drapion. Once it has Tricked its Choice Scarf away, Uxie can function perfectly well as a scout and defensive pivot, as even with no investment in Defense, it's still bulky enough to withstand assaults from strong Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and Hitmonlee.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because this set does such a superb job when it comes to luring and crippling common special walls such as Chansey, Registeel, and specially defensive Arcanine, pairing Uxie with Pokemon who can take advantage of the removal of these threats is recommended. Special Venusaur, Moltres, and Mismagius are some great choices for this role. Uxie also tends to attract Pursuit users, especially those holding Choice items, as they can switch in for free on three of Uxie's four attacks and put it in a checkmate position. Because of that, having teammates who can set up on Dark-type attacks, such as Swords Dance Blaziken and Rock Polish Aggron, is extremely beneficial.</p>

<p>Just like the Support set, this Uxie works very well in the lead position, as the added Speed enables Uxie to circumvent every sort of Taunt user either by setting Stealth Rock up before they can shut it down, or just by Tricking them its Choice Scarf, thus forcing said leads to switch out, which can be used in conjunction with U-turn to maintain momentum for your side. Additionally, Pokemon focused on setting up weather, such as opposing Uxie and Mesprit, undergo the same problems, as the loss of their weather-lengthening items means that they are limited to five turns of weather and are forced out afterwards.</p>

<p>Due to carrying no status inflicting moves and having a rather mediocre Special Attack, one of the main issues Uxie has to bear with is the inability to do anything meaningful to a good number of sweepers once it Tricks its Choice Scarf away, meaning the pixie becomes major setup fodder for bulkier threats such as Altaria, Feraligatr, and Calm Mind users such as Slowbro, Spiritomb, and Mismagius. Because of this, Milotic is a very good partner to this set, given its access to Haze and well-balanced defenses that allow it to easily take on most of the aforementioned threats. Alternatively, you can run either Yawn or Thunder Wave over Stealth Rock to deter sweepers from switching in too readily, but that removes a great part of Uxie’s effectiveness as a lead and doesn't necessarily ensure that Uxie can shut them down, as most of the above Pokemon have means of circumventing status effects.</p>

move 3: Psychic
move 4: Stealth Rock
item: Damp Rock / Heat Rock
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 32 Def / 224 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Uxie's outstanding defensive stats allow it to switch into many common attacks with relative ease, while its high Speed stat allows it to outpace opposing Pokemon and use Rain Dance or Sunny Day before taking a hit. Uxie can also use Memento to sacrifice itself to enable the team's Swift Swim or Chlorophyll sweeper to switch in without risk. With U-turn, however, Uxie can immediately switch to your sweepers while staying healthy, enabling it to set up weather later in the game. Heal Bell gives sweepers who are afflicted by status a second chance at wreaking havoc. Psychic is an important STAB to carry because it prevents Uxie from being complete Taunt bait, and stops Pokemon such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Rhyperior from setting up an easy Substitute. Even more importantly, it eliminates opposing Toxicroak who can easily put a stop to most Swift Swim sweepers' sweeps. Stealth Rock is put in the last slot, as it is good for additional team support and guarantees important KOs for your sweepers. Uxie can use either Rain Dance and Damp Rock, or Sunny Day and Heat Rock; the choice between the two depends on your team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs give Uxie just enough Speed to outpace Rotom who lack Choice Scarf. All that bulk is good for letting Uxie set up multiple times during a game, or get one full setup and then use Memento. Uxie can be used as either a mid-game weather machine or as a lead; if you are using Uxie as a lead, a bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD, a Bold nature, and U-turn over Memento are recommended. Using the same EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD but with a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs can be helpful to let Uxie move second, allowing it to set up a weather condition and then take a hit before U-turning out; this allows Uxie's teammate to come in unscathed. If you have another Stealth Rock user on your team, Uxie can use Heal Bell over Stealth Rock to better support its team.</p> 

<p>Uxie's job is to set up either Rain Dance or Sunny Day, so Pokemon with Swift Swim or Chlorophyll are required to take advantage of the weather Uxie sets up. Fire-types are also good teammates if Uxie is using Sunny Day. As this Uxie's job is to support its team, faster Taunt users who resist Psychic-type attacks, such as Houndoom, Drapion, and Alakazam, will be troublesome. Houndoom and Drapion are especially annoying, as they can use Pursuit on Uxie as it switches out. On weather teams, you really won't carry team members specifically to deal with these threats, but they can be taken down by weather-boosted attacks fairly easily. If your team is particularly weak to them, U-turn will be much more helpful than Memento on Uxie to hit them super effectively.</p>

[SET]

evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Uxie's sheer bulk allows it to easily set up any of the many options in its repertoire to support the entire team, and dual screens are no exception. What sets Uxie apart from the other bulky dual screens users out there, though, is Memento, which faints Uxie to harshly lower the current foe's attacking stats, and allows a teammate to come in scot-free. With dual screens up, and those stat drops on the opponent, even the frailest of stat-uppers can find enough room to set up, which is great news for Belly Drummers such as Linoone and Charizard, who are usually too frail to do so otherwise.</p>

<p>Dual screens are a given on this set, halving the damage your team will take from direct attacks. But the toss-up between U-turn and Memento in the third slot is a tough choice to make. While Memento's advantages should be well-known by now, U-turn is an equally useful tool, which shares most of the utility of Memento, but swaps stat drops on the opponent for not sacrificing Uxie, allowing it to further support the team with its bulk. In the final slot, choose what gaps your team needs filled in; Stealth Rock is great if you lack another Pokemon on your team to set it up, Yawn causes switches that can be taken advantage of, and Thunder Wave can cripple certain sweepers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>HP is maximized first so Uxie can sponge hits even before the dual screens are set up. Then, Defense is maximized as it does help protect Uxie from the more common Dark- and Bug-type attacks that Uxie will face, particularly Pursuit and U-turn. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense for an added ounce of special bulk. Light Clay is the recommended item here, in order to extend the duration of the dual screens by a further three turns, which will come in handy much more often than you might think.</p>

<p>If using this set as a lead, a spread of 252 HP / 32 Def / 224 Spe with a Timid nature is recommended to outspeed Moltres, allowing Uxie to perform its full setup (dual screens + Stealth Rocks) duties easily. However, like every other lead out there, this one has trouble with certain leads, particularly those who set up Spikes, as Uxie can do absolutely nothing to stop them. So, packing a Rapid Spin user or a team mostly immune to Spikes is probably a good idea. Completely maximizing Speed is another idea, to tie with Houndoom and Drapion, allowing Uxie to have a chance of setting up a screen before they pummel it with their powerful STABs.</p>

<p>Countering this set is hard because of dual screens. With Reflect up, even Absol's Swords Dance-boosted Night Slash fails to KO, and with Light Screen up, neither will Houndoom's Nasty Plot-boosted Dark Pulse. However, Mismagius has a field day with this set, as it is able to freely switch in on any of Uxie's moves, set up a Substitute, and proceed to boost up its stats with ease. Therefore, having a way to eliminate Mismagius is crucial. Spiritomb works well, as it is able to use the Light Screen set up by Uxie to cushion any Shadow Ball Mismagius might throw at it and either retaliate with Dark Pulse or checkmate it with a combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Uxie is usually found in a supporting role, where it sports high amounts of HP and defensive EVs, this Uxie aims to surprise opponents by hitting many common leads hard, often OHKOing those who are weak to its moves. Pokemon such as Omastar, Rhyperior, Venusaur, and Cloyster will expect Uxie to U-turn out in fear of their entry hazards or sheer power, only to be KOed by one of Uxie's coverage moves. In addition, Uxie carries U-turn to help you quickly gain the upper hand after it has netted a kill. Uxie still performs its supporting duties by laying down Stealth Rock rather easily thanks to its base 95 Speed and massive bulk. Even with no defensive investment, Uxie can take plenty of unboosted and neutral hits, which allows it to function as a bulky check to quite a few Pokemon. Lastly, its attacking prowess prevents it from becoming setup fodder, unlike the defensive sets.</p>

<p>Psychic is the obligatory STAB move, and lets Uxie pound Venusaur and Nidoking leads. It also deals great damage to a majority of the other common leads, including Arcanine, Ambipom, and Electrode. Energy Ball is for getting the OHKO on Omastar, Rhyperior, Cloyster, and Kabutops leads. The third slot is a choice between U-turn and Thunderbolt. Uxie still has problems with Mismagius, Spiritomb, and Alakazam leads, so giving Uxie a quick escape route off the battlefield is recommended. However, Thunderbolt hits Moltres and Scyther for super effective damage, as well as giving Uxie near perfect neutral coverage alongside Psychic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Another option is to use Grass Knot over Energy Ball, as Energy Ball will not always OHKO Rhyperior, whereas Grass Knot will. Another advantage Grass Knot has is that Milotic and Donphan are hit noticeably harder. However, Uxie will lose the ability to OHKO Cloyster and Omastar. Thunder Wave can be used in the third slot to cripple fast Pokemon who attempt to switch in and revenge kill Uxie, such as Rotom, Sceptile, and Houndoom. If more power is desired, Life Orb is an option to net some kills that Expert Belt cannot. Lum Berry is useful for ensuring the win against sleep leads such as Venusaur and Butterfree, as well as for taking Thunder Wave from the likes of lead Mesprit and opposing Uxie. Leftovers can be used to gain more survivability, but this is not recommended as Uxie is already lacking in power as it is.</p> 

<p>While Mesprit is usually the better of the pixies to lead with if power is desired, Uxie can function just as well, if not better. Pokemon such as Moltres, Venusaur, and Kabutops are all faster than or tie with Mesprit and can all deal serious damage to it, often to the point where Mesprit has to choose between knocking out the opposing lead or laying down Stealth Rock. Uxie's bulk, on the other hand, often enables it to survive hits that Mesprit cannot. Uxie's base 95 Speed also allows it to outpace quite a few Pokemon whom Mesprit cannot. Uxie's Special Attack score, however, does not quite match Mesprit's, which can often lead to missing out on a few kills that Mesprit would achieve.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Another interesting move you will find if you dig far enough down Uxie's supporting movepool (in alphabetical order, of course) is Trick Room, which Uxie can set up easily because of, once again, its great bulk and immunity to Ground-type attacks. It is also unique as a Trick Room supporter in that it actually has a high base Speed, which allows it to supply a sort of "slow" U-turn under Trick Room's effects, giving it a nice little niche. Yawn is great for forcing switches, and U-turn is great for capitalizing on these switches to bring a sweeper in for free. Finally, Psychic is placed in the last slot as a nice reliable STAB move, so that Uxie is not complete Taunt bait.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Bulk is completely maximized, so that Uxie has more chances to set up Trick Room repeatedly throughout the match. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature capitalizes on its relatively high Speed stat though, giving it that nice "slow" U-turn so that it, and not a sweeper teammate, takes a hit when U-turn is used.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Yawn and Psychic can be replaced with the dual screens. The strategy to employ when using both dual screens and Trick Room is to set up the dual screens first followed by the use of Trick Room. If using dual screens, giving Uxie a Light Clay is recommended so that the duration of the screens lasts even after Trick Room has ended. Using both dual screens and Trick Room unfortunately leaves Uxie with only one other free moveslot, and it is usually forced to use U-turn so that Uxie's sweeping partner can come in unscathed.</p> 

<p>Mismagius, Absol, and Houndoom are major threats to Uxie thanks to their super effective STABs and the latter two's access to Pursuit. Hariyama is a prime switch-in to the latter two, and it can easily outpace both after Uxie uses Trick Room, scaring them off with a STAB Fighting-type move. Registeel can handle Mismagius, and with Trick Room down, it will have a much easier job doing so. Some examples of Pokemon who make phenomenal Trick Room sweepers alongside Uxie include Camerupt, Rhyperior, Azumarill, and Marowak.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With excellent bulk and good Speed, Uxie can effectively use a combination of Substitute and Calm Mind. Substitute blocks the "triple Ts", which are Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Trick, all three of which horribly cripple Uxie. It also allows Uxie to avoid Sucker Punch and critical hits, making it an excellent bulky set-up sweeper. With Calm Mind, Uxie can set up on many of UU's top threats, such as Milotic and Venusaur. After a Calm Mind, standard bulky Milotic's Surf will fail to break Uxie's Substitute. Psychic is Uxie's STAB of choice while Thunderbolt offers the best neutral coverage alongside it, allowing Uxie to defeat Haze Milotic one-on-one. With Thunderbolt, Uxie can set up Calm Mind and immediately slam Milotic with Thunderbolt while Milotic uses Haze to wipe away Uxie's Calm Mind boosts. Uxie can then use Calm Mind again while Milotic Recovers and repeat the process until Milotic runs out of PP for Recover or gets nailed by a critical hit and loses. Signal Beam is also an option should you wish to hit opposing Psychic-types harder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The HP EVs provide Uxie with enough bulk to switch into Moltres's Fire Blast, use Calm Mind, and not be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. The heavy Speed investment allows Uxie to outspeed Timid Rotom, while the rest are placed into Special Attack to power up Uxie's offenses. If checking Moltres is not difficult for your team, an alternative EV spread of 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe with the same nature can be used to allow Uxie to hit as hard as possible. Hidden Power Ground can also be used in the final spot to hit Drapion, and is also Uxie's strongest attack option to use against Registeel.</p>

<p>Registeel and Chansey are big problems for this set, while Clefable with Encore and Spiritomb cause trouble for Uxie as well. Dugtrio can trap and remove Registeel and Chansey without too much trouble, while Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonlee can scare away Chansey and Clefable. Houndoom sets up on Spiritomb relatively easily while Uxie can switch into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks aimed at it, as well as setting up on bulky Water-types who attempt to counter Houndoom. Mixed Houndoom who utilize Beat Up can also get past Chansey. Specially defensive Drapion counters Uxie pretty well too, as it can heavily damage Uxie with its STAB attacks or use Whirlwind to force Uxie out. Apart from Dugtrio, who can trap and KO Drapion, Rhyperior is also a great teammate for Uxie, as it is able switch into anything Drapion throws at it and set up Rock Polish or Substitute. Should Uxie lack Thunderbolt, Milotic with Haze can cause Uxie problems as well, as it can use Haze to remove Uxie's boosts and use Recover to heal itself. Venusaur is an excellent switch-in to Milotic, easily scaring it away with its powerful STABs while luring in Registeel and putting it to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Uxie has a rather average-looking Special Attack stat, its high Speed stat, along with excellent bulk, a good movepool, and access to Calm Mind, allows it to become a decent sweeper. On top of this, Uxie is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and not weak to Stealth Rock, meaning it is difficult to take down in one shot. This set is especially dangerous to the offensive Fire / Water / Grass cores used in UU. The idea is to bring Uxie in on the many Pokemon who can't pose a threat to it and set up Calm Mind. Even at only +1, Uxie is strong enough to hurt many offensive teams. Psychic is used again as Uxie's STAB. Grass Knot allows Uxie to muscle through Milotic, easily 2HKOing it after a boost. It also allows Uxie to 3HKO Spiritomb; so with some prediction, Uxie may be able to set up on Sucker Punch and defeat Spiritomb.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Ground rounds out Uxie's coverage, allowing it to defeat Houndoom and other Dark-type Pokemon such as Skuntank and Drapion. It also allows Uxie to somewhat hurt Registeel. Thunderbolt can also be used as it offers better neutral coverage and is Uxie's strongest move against Absol, while also hitting Moltres and Articuno for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Like most special sweepers, Uxie is walled by both Registeel and Chansey. Both can easily take Uxie's attacks and then cripple it with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Dugtrio is a good teammate to run alongside offensive Uxie, as it can trap and remove both thanks to its Arena Trap ability and strong STAB Earthquake. Hariyama and other Fighting-types can also switch into both Registeel and Chansey and scare them away with the threat of their STAB attacks. Venusaur can lure in Registeel and cripple it with Sleep Powder, allowing Uxie to set up on it much more easily. Specially defensive Drapion and Skuntank check Uxie should it run Thunderbolt, so pairing Uxie with a Ground-type, such as Donphan and Rhyperior, can help Uxie bypass these threats.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Once Uxie acquires enough Calm Minds, this set can be a dangerous sweeper. Thanks to its already-high defensive stats, Uxie will more than likely obtain plenty of Calm Minds over a long period of time. Additionally, immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes makes this set one of the best mono-attackers around, as Uxie can switch in at any point of the match without taking any major residual damage. The main idea when using this set is to switch in on a weak attack, set up Calm Minds until Uxie is at low health, and then use Rest. While Uxie is asleep, use Sleep Talk to allow Uxie the opportunity to garner even more Calm Mind boosts or possibly nail the opponent with Psychic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set's effectiveness heavily relies on how well you have scouted your opponent's team. It's highly recommended that Uxie is brought out in the later stages of the match, as common defensive Pokemon such as Haze Milotic can be a major barricade to Uxie. Dark-types with Taunt also shut this set down cold, so it is recommended that they are scouted and eliminated beforehand. Donphan makes an excellent partner thanks to its ability to draw in and 2HKO Spiritomb with Stealth Rock in play. Additionally, pairing Donphan with a dangerous Flying-type such as Scyther or Moltres can be beneficial, as it forces the opponent to use Spiritomb to block your Rapid Spin attempts even more. Lastly, Donphan can draw in Milotic, which can make planning Uxie's potential sweep much easier.</p>

<p>Choice Specs Rotom makes a good offensive partner, as it can draw in defensive Dark-types and strike them hard with STAB Thunderbolt. Similarly, Mismagius can easily inflict respectable damage to most Dark-types after a Nasty Plot boost. Substitute Dugtrio makes a great offensive partner thanks to its ability to trap Chansey and Registeel, who are both major blocks to a successful Uxie sweep. Furthermore, Substitute Dugtrio can be used to deal with Drapion, Houndoom, and Absol with correct prediction.</p>

<p>If you reveal Uxie early in the match to safeguard your team against the multitude of physical sweepers in UU, then pairing it with a defensive Pokemon to deal with its typical counters is recommended. Defensive Hitmontop can deal with Drapion and Absol, while Venusaur can check Haze Milotic. Though it's not necessary, Spikes support can make the process of removing defensive juggernauts such as Milotic much quicker, which can ultimately lead to an easier sweep for Uxie.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>For other boosting moves, Uxie is left with only Amnesia. While boosting Uxie's already awesome base Special Defense to impenetrable levels seems like a cool idea, Uxie is much better off utilizing Calm Mind which provides not only a Special Defense boost, but also a Special Attack boost. Toxic can be used on any of the sets listed above over one of Uxie's other supporting options; however, Uxie is much more adept at spreading paralysis, and without instant recovery, can't really stall long enough for Toxic to KO the opponent.</p>

<p>For alternative attacking options, Uxie has a plethora of choices. Signal Beam stands out as the most prominent choice for a super effective hit on fellow Psychic-types, Tangrowth, and Leafeon. Shadow Ball can be used in place of Thunderbolt or Grass Knot on the more offensive sets to nab a surprise hit on Mismagius, Rotom, and Dusclops, but that's the extent of its uses. Uxie can make use of Charge Beam as an in-between for Thunderbolt and Calm Mind; however, the accuracy is troublesome and Uxie appreciates the Special Defense boost that goes along with Calm Mind. Uxie can also utilize alternative Hidden Powers, specifically Hidden Power Ice, to get a nice hit on Altaria, but otherwise Uxie is better off using its other moves. Finally, if using a physically inclined Uxie, the elemental punches, most prominently ThunderPunch, are available as substitutes for Thunderbolt and Uxie's other moves.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The biggest and baddest counters to any Uxie set are Taunt users. Absol, Ambipom, and Spiritomb stand out as the most threatening as they can Taunt Uxie and proceed to either nail it with Pursuit before it can U-turn out or smack it with Payback or Shadow Ball should it stay in. If Uxie is left with only Psychic as its attacking move, a whole plethora of threats in UU can use the opportunity to switch into Uxie and proceed to set up or eliminate Uxie with ease. Dark-types such as Houndoom and Drapion can use Uxie to set up Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively, and demolish Uxie with Dark Pulse or Crunch. Mismagius and Rotom have an easy time switching into any Uxie set and can either set up a Substitute before Uxie can paralyze them or eliminate it with Shadow Ball. Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable can stall any Substitute-less Uxie with a combination of Seismic Toss and Toxic. Rhyperior gets a special mention as an Uxie counter as it can switch into any Grass Knot-less Uxie, takes little damage from anything it can dish out, is immune to Thunder Wave, and can proceed to set up one of either Substitute, Swords Dance, or Rock Polish. In general, as Uxie is a supporter first and an attacker second, most Uxie will lack any kind of offensive power. So, any Pokemon with decent bulk can pound away at Uxie and eventually eliminate it thanks to its absence of recovery outside of Rest.</p>
