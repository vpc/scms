[Overview]

<p>Rotom may appear to be outclassed by Mismagius due to the latter's higher Special Attack and Speed, but Rotom has a couple of unique traits. It has a fantastic dual typing that boasts many immunities and resistances that allow it to handle many physical threats, a plethora of status inducing moves, and an unresisted STAB attack combo (Steelix and Magneton the only exceptions). This little plasmatic ghost should never be looked down upon, as it can become quite a nuisance towards the opponent.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to keep Rotom alive as long as possible while still packing some offensive power. With Substitute, Rotom can block damaging status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic from Registeel or Chansey. It also protects Rotom from Sucker Punch from Pokemon such as Toxicroak, allowing it to safely revenge kill them. In addition, Substitute is useful for easing prediction when Rotom expects a switch. However, Life Orb recoil and Substitute damage will pile up quickly. This is where Pain Split comes in. Pain Split allows Rotom to get back to near-perfect health due to its low base 50 HP. Substitute and Pain Split work as a useful stalling strategy for Rotom, especially as one of its common switch-ins, Chansey, can’t touch it behind a Substitute, while Rotom can Pain Split it to get back to full health. The combination of Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball provides Rotom with almost perfect coverage, as the only common Pokemon in UU who resists it is Steelix.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs give Rotom 309 Speed, outspeeding dangerous Pokemon such as Timid Moltres and Jolly / Timid Toxicroak, while at worst Speed tying with other Rotom who lack Choice Scarf. Maximum Special Attack is so Rotom hits as hard as possible; its base 95 Special Attack stat is not particularly powerful, so it needs all the investment it can get. The leftover EVs are placed in Defense rather than HP to maintain a low HP, allowing for maximum recovery from Pain Split. Life Orb is the necessary item, as Rotom is lacking in power due to its underwhelming Special Attack stat and can still recover health through Pain Split.</p>

<p>This set has problems with several Pokemon it can't hit hard enough. Steelix is immune to Thunderbolt and resists Shadow Ball, so it can be troublesome, as it can simply set up Stealth Rock and Roar Rotom out. Bulky Water-types such as Blastoise and Milotic are useful to deal with Steelix, as they will take little from its attacks and can threaten Steelix with a STAB Surf. Additionally, Blastoise can also spin away the entry hazards that it sets up. Registeel is another problem for this set if it has Ice Punch or Shadow Claw as it will break Rotom's Substitutes with ease while taking little damage from Thunderbolt. Torterra and Donphan can both beat Registeel, but the former must watch out for Ice Punch. Like Steelix, Dugtrio can also finish off a weakened Registeel as Earthquake does 59.3% - 69.8% to most variants. Spiritomb can be troublesome for this set as it can Shadow Sneak Rotom and prevent Rotom from switching out with the threat of Pursuit. Houndoom, Moltres, and Blaziken are very useful partners to take out Spiritomb as well as both Steelix and Registeel. </p>

<p>Drapion can't easily switch into Rotom unless it is very specially defensive, but once in, it will outspeed and threaten Rotom with Crunch or even Pursuit a fleeing Rotom, while specially defensive versions take 41.9% - 49.1% from Thunderbolt, so they can usually do well against Rotom if they don't switch in on Thunderbolt. Dugtrio can be useful to trap and OHKO offensive Drapion, as well as defensive ones when they are slightly weakened. Defensive Venusaur and Torterra cause this set problems as they aren’t 2HKOed by Shadow Ball and can hit back hard with STAB Grass-type attacks. Both also have Synthesis so they can stay around for a while and deal with Rotom. Leafeon can handle Torterra and also physical versions of Venusaur (assuming you already have someone put to sleep by Sleep Powder) so it makes an effective partner to Rotom. It can also provide Heal Bell support if the opponent manages to get Rotom statused. Fire-types such as Blaziken, Houndoom, and Moltres also scare off these Grass-types. Considering the problems caused by Steel- and Dark-types , Fighting-types such as Blaziken, Hariyama, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak make good partners.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rotom has decent Special Attack and Speed stats, and with all of those immunities and resistances Rotom can come in on, it’s a natural candidate for wielding a Choice item. With Choice Scarf, Modest Rotom reaches a Speed stat of 421, while with Choice Specs, Timid Rotom reaches a great Special Attack stat of 433.</p>

<p>Rotom can be quite devastating by using just STAB Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball attacks, since they achieve almost perfect coverage, only resisted by Steelix and Magneton. The last attacking option goes to Hidden Power Fighting or Hidden Power Grass. Hidden Power Fighting hits Steelix and Magneton that attempt to switch in on Rotom for super effective damage, which means that Rotom really gains perfect coverage. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass hits Lanturn and Ground-types hard, is powerful enough to OHKO Donphan, and hits Steelix for neutral damage. Both of the Hidden Power attacks provide near-perfect coverage, so it’s really up to personal preference. Those aren't the only Hidden Power types Rotom can use though, as Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Ground can be used as well. If you are planning on using Rotom with a Choice Scarf and a Timid nature, Hidden Power Ice can be used as Rotom becomes a great Rock Polish Torterra and Dragon Dance Altaria check. Hidden Power Ground allows you to hit all of Steelix, Magneton, Camerupt, and Lanturn for super effective damage, but you miss the KO against Absol and other Dark-types that are weak to Fighting attacks. Will-O-Wisp may seem like a bad option on a Choice set due to the fact that Rotom has to switch out after it uses it, but it definitely has its uses. Normally, people will never suspect a Choiced attacker to be carrying a status move, meaning they'll try to switch in Pokemon like Registeel or Absol to take Rotom's Shadow Ball, only to be burned. For the final move option, Trick is the best option due to Rotom's barren movepool. Tricking a Choice item onto tanks or walls is a great way to cripple them, being especially effective since Pokemon like Chansey and Registeel love to switch in on Rotom.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As always, being locked into one attack can cause problems. For instance, if Rotom is locked into using Shadow Ball, a Dark-type Pursuit user like Absol or Drapion can easily destroy it, or if Rotom is using Thunderbolt, a Ground-type like Torterra can get a free turn to set up. Even though Rotom can use Trick to cripple tanks or walls like Chansey, they can still switch in on Rotom’s attacks with ease and set up themselves. To solve these problems, simply scout your opponent’s team before sending out Rotom to see if their team consists of any Pursuit users or special walls. There are multiple ways one can scout the opponent’s team; the two most common strategies are utilizing U-turn and Roar or Whirlwind. Primeape is an excellent U-turner as it can force many switches with its powerful Close Combat, while Donphan makes an excellent Pokemon to use Roar because of its great physical bulk. These two simple strategies can reveal many Pokemon from your opponent’s team, giving you an idea if it’s safe to switch in Rotom. As for dealing with the special walls, using a strong Fighting-type Pokemon can easily fend off the most prominent special wall: Chansey. Primeape deserves a mention again because of its ability to threaten Chansey, forcing it to switch out (in which case you can use U-turn if you predict it to switch out), or be OHKOed by Close Combat. Primeape also deals with other specially defensive Pokemon like Registeel or Clefable, both of which can be quite troublesome for Rotom to take down.</p>

nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>SubCharge Rotom is by far the most effective offensive set Rotom can use. Its common switch-ins, such as Chansey and Registeel, turn into setup bait instead of brick walls, thanks to two simple moves: Substitute and Charge Beam.</p>

<p>The use of Substitute and Charge Beam makes Rotom a very threatening offensive force once it has collected a few Special Attack boosts. Most importantly, Substitute allows Rotom to block status effects from the likes of Chansey and Registeel that attempt to induce it with, as well as not breaking in one hit from either of their attacks. Not only that, but Substitute makes a great way to scout the opponent’s switch-in. For instance, if Rotom is up against Claydol, the opponent will most likely switch out in the fear of Shadow Ball. By knowing this, you can set up Substitute instead as the opponent switches out, and use the most appropriate move against the newly switched in Pokemon. This works especially well against Pursuit and Sucker Punch users like Absol, since if Rotom is behind a Substitute, it can try to eliminate them with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fighting. After Rotom is safely behind Substitute, it can then boost its Special Attack with Charge Beam, eventually gaining enough power to KO Chansey and Registeel, two huge threats, with Thunderbolt. If you are interested in type coverage rather than power, Hidden Power Fighting can be used. It helps pound down Steelix and Magneton that give Rotom serious amounts of trouble, as they are both resistant (Steelix being immune to Electric-type attacks) to both of Rotom’s STAB moves. Shadow Ball takes up the last moveslot by providing Rotom with a powerful secondary STAB attack to use and provides great type coverage in conjunction with Rotom’s Electric-type moves, especially helpful against Pokemon who are immune or resistant to Electric-type attacks, such as Lanturn and Torterra.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is extremely straightforward; max Special Attack and Speed give Rotom as much offensive power as possible. An alternative spread of 152 Def / 106 SpA / 252 Spe gives Rotom's Substitute enough bulk to withstand Registeel’s Ice Punch that use 100 Attack EVs, which is very beneficial when it comes to setting up against it. This spread is not necessarily important, but if you dislike the fact that Registeel can break Rotom’s Substitute, it’s a great spread to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Even though this may be one of Rotom’s best offensive sets that can beat its common switch-ins, it still has two problems: Ground-types and Pokemon who are faster than it. Ground-type Pokemon can switch in on Charge Beam fearlessly, meaning Rotom achieves no Special Attack boosts, which leaves it relatively weak. Steelix and Quagsire are both prime examples of this situation. Steelix boasts an immunity to Electric attacks, resistance to Shadow Ball, and is never 2HKOed by an unboosted Hidden Power Fighting. It can then hurt Rotom badly with Stone Edge. Quagsire works the same way, except it takes no super effective hits, allowing it to finish off Rotom with repeated Waterfall attacks or setting up multiple Curses. Rotom may become a big threat with a couple of Charge Beam boosts, but it can still be easily revenge-killed by faster threats, like Houndoom and Mismagius, because of its mediocre defenses. To deal with these two threats, Hariyama and Drapion are excellent choices. Houndoom hates being face to face with Hariyama because of its resistance to Dark- and Fire-type attacks (due to Hariyama’s Thick Fat ability), allowing it to scare off Houndoom with a powerful STAB Fighting-type move. As for Mismagius, Drapion makes a great Pokemon to use against it with its resistance to Shadow Ball and neutrality to Hidden Power Fighting and Thunderbolt, allowing it to eliminate Mismagius from the remainder of the battle with Pursuit.</p>

move 2: Sleep Talk

nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Rotom isn't seen as a bulky Pokemon, it’s capable of countering some of UU's biggest physical threats, most notably Swellow, Scyther, and any Fighting-type. The reason for this is because of Rotom’s fantastic dual typing that boasts multiple resistances or immunities to Fighting, Flying, Bug, and Ground.</p>

<p>Rotom is bulky enough to survive many hits coming from physical sweepers. For example, Hitmonlee and Hitmontop both fail to 2HKO Rotom with Stone Edge, meaning Rotom can burn them with Will-O-Wisp, making them close to useless. Swellow doesn't come close to a 3HKO with Brave Bird, and Scyther fares even worse. Not only can that, but this set also handles Dark-types like Absol that may attempt to Pursuit you, because Pursuit will fail to OHKO assuming you stay in, allowing Rotom to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Once Rotom has taken multiple hits, it can heal off the damage with Rest, while Sleep Talk prevents Pokemon from setting up on you while you are sleeping.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Due to the fact that Rotom is being used defensively, it makes one of the best Rapid Spin blockers in UU, being able to switch in on many Rapid Spinners fearlessly and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp, as most of them are physically based. With this being said, if your team's goal consists of setting up as much entry hazards as possible, Rotom is a prime candidate to prevent the entry hazards from being removed. Due to Rotom's heavy EV investment in Defense, it is vulnerable to high-powered special attacks. For example, a Modest Life Orb Milotic can OHKO Rotom with Hydro Pump if Stealth Rock is in play. To fix this problem, pairing Rotom with Pokemon who boast a high Special Defense stat can be helpful. Chansey and Registeel are excellent choices for switching into special attacks. Chansey is the number one special wall in UU thanks to her incredible special bulk and has multiple support moves to aid the team as a whole, including Wish, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Registeel is also capable of inflicting status and setting up Stealth Rock, but it also boasts an immunity to Poison-type attacks and useful resistances to Grass-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves.<p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rotom is capable of abusing almost every status effect, and this set is dedicated to inflicting as much status as it can against the opponent’s team. This set is also a fantastic supporter, since Pokemon who are crippled are much easier to take down than those that aren’t. The three status effects Rotom uses to try to cripple the opponent's Pokemon are burn, paralysis, and poison, an excellent status combination.</p>

<p>Discharge is a great move to use as it has a 30% chance to paralyze the enemy while doing a decent amount of damage at the same time. Will-O-Wisp is definitely useful against physical sweepers, allowing Rotom to deal with them much easier. It also helps Rotom deal with Steel-types, as most don’t mind paralysis since they are already slow (or in Steelix's case, immune to Discharge), and are immune to Toxic. Walls like Porygon2 and Lanturn can be quite troublesome to take down with your sweepers, so Toxic does a very good job at wearing them down. Shadow Ball is Rotom’s main choice for attacking as it has more power than Discharge and better overall coverage. Confuse Ray can be used instead of Shadow Ball if you feel the need for the added status, as Confuse Ray can form the dreaded parafusion combo, or it can simply wear down the Pokemon’s health even faster if they are burnt or poisoned. The addition of Pain Split to Rotom's movepool is extremely helpful. Since Rotom has such a low HP stat, Pain Split can help it heal back a great amount of its health, especially against Chansey because of her huge HP stat. Lastly, Substitute is an option for scouting your opponent's moves and helps Rotom stall for Toxic or Will-O-Wisp damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>When using this Rotom set, it is important to have Pokemon on your team that can take advantage of the opponent’s Pokemon being crippled by status. For example, if you're using a Pokemon who is relatively slow like Azumarill, paralyzing the opponent’s team can help it move first, allowing it to become more devastating. Physical sweepers like Feraligatr hate it when Slowbro tries to end their sweep, so by poisoning Slowbro, it will gradually lose HP and lose its ability to wall. In addition, defensively frail Pokemon can be supported by Rotom's burns. All in all, this Rotom set opens up many opportunities for your sweepers, tanks, and walls, allowing them to become more effective than usual.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Rotom may not have the greatest of defensive stats, its handful of immunities and reasonably high Speed allow it to become an effective dual screener, while still being able to cripple dangerous physical threats with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p>The procedure for using this set is quite simple: use either Reflect or Light Screen depending on the situation you’re in, followed by Will-O-Wisp to cripple the opposing Pokemon, assuming you opt for it. When facing a strong physical attacker like Feraligatr, it would be a better idea to burn it with Will-O-Wisp instead of trying to set up Reflect first, since a burned Feraligatr’s Attack will a be lowered permanently, unlike Reflect's five (or eight depending your item) turn duration. If you dislike using Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split is an excellent secondary option. It gives Rotom much more longevity, allowing it to set up screens more than once, not to mention the fact that Rotom boasts a reasonably low HP stat, which helps it heal back more of its health with Pain Split, especially against bulky threats like Registeel and Chansey. As for the offensive options, Thunderbolt is preferred over Shadow Ball due to its higher Base Power and neutral coverage; however, Shadow Ball is an option if you feel the need to hit Ground-types or Electric-types harder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum Speed allows Rotom to have a chance at setting up the desired screen before being hit by an attack, and 252 HP EVs provide maximum overall bulk. Leftovers is normally recommended over Light Clay as it will let Rotom take more hits by replenishing its health, but Light Clay can be used if you feel the need for extra team support.</p>

<p>It is recommended to have teammates who can take advantage of the dual screens, especially setup sweepers. Great examples of these type of Pokemon include Feraligatr, Mismagius, and Houndoom. With dual screen support, Feraligatr is capable of achieving more Dragon Dance boosts, Mismagius will boast a tougher Substitute to break, allowing it to boost up with Calm Mind, and Houndoom can set up multiple Nasty Plot boosts. Other Pokemon who can use the dual screens effectively are powerful but frail sweepers, like Blaziken and Rampardos. Blaziken is arguably the best wallbreaker in UU, but its frailness tends to end its life quite quickly, meaning that having dual screen support will give Blaziken more survivability. Rampardos has pathetic defensive stats, but massive base 165 Attack. With dual screen support, Rampardos has a higher chance of getting the Rock Polish needed attempt a sweep.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rotom doesn't really have too many options, as its movepool is rather limited. For support options, Rotom can use Rain Dance on a Rain Dance team, and it can work well in conjunction with Thunder. It also has Spite to reduce PP on one of the opponent’s moves, but Rotom usually has better things to do. Lastly, Rotom can use Thunder Wave, but usually Discharge is a superior option as it has a reasonably high chance at inducing paralysis, while also causing a decent amount of damage at the same time. On the offensive side, Rotom has moves like Dark Pulse, Ominous Wind, and Sucker Punch. STAB Shadow Ball already hits whatever Dark Pulse would hit for super effective damage. Ominous Wind isn’t a very useful option, since Rotom doesn’t have the bulk to keep trying to increase its stats, while Sucker Punch is an even poorer option as it receives no STAB and Rotom has too pathetic an Attack stat to make it viable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chansey is probably Rotom's biggest counter because of her extremely high Special Defense and HP stats, allowing Chansey to cripple Rotom with Toxic or Thunder Wave while shrugging off any damage taken. Registeel works the same way as Chansey, as it boasts great special bulk and can cripple Rotom as well. The only problem the aforementioned counters have is if they're up against SubCharge Rotom, as they can't do anything against it. Lanturn, on the other hand, is capable of countering the SubCharge set due to its Volt Absorb ability and great Special Defense and HP and can then proceed to hit Rotom hard with Surf.</p>

<p>Pokemon who boast a high Special Attack stat and powerful special moves can end Rotom with ease. Examples of these include Blaziken, Magmortar, and Espeon. All of the aforementioned Pokemon are capable of OHKOing Rotom if they are wielding Life Orb or Choice Specs and using their respective STAB attacks.</p>

<p>Dark-types can switch into Rotom's Shadow Ball and can end it quickly with STAB Pursuit, particularly Drapion and Absol with their high Attack stats. Umbreon, although not commonly seen using Pursuit, has the bulk to withstand several Thunderbolt attacks from Rotom, allowing it to seriously damage Rotom with Payback. Also, its Synchronize ability will make Rotom think twice before burning it with Will-O-Wisp, as it will be burned too. Grass-types like Torterra and Venusaur are effective switch-ins to Rotom as well, boasting a resistance to Thunderbolt and having decent overall bulk, allowing them to hurt Rotom with their respective STAB moves; though they should watch outfor Will-O-Wisp and the occasional Hidden Power Ice.</p>
