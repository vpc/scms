[Overview]

<p>If not the best in class, Alakazam is at least one of the most powerful special sweepers in the UU tier. With excellent Speed and Special Attack stats, Alakazam goes through teams that lack priority moves or a Choice Scarf Pokemon with relative ease. While offense is Alakazam's natural role, it can also run a few useful supporting roles, such as dual screening and Encore support. Alakazam's main drawbacks are its paper-thin defenses and lack of resistances. Most priority attackers will take a huge chunk out of Alakazam's HP, threatening to cripple or OHKO it. While STAB Psychic is a great attacking type in UU, it also allows Dark-types to switch in without taking a scratch. Houndoom, for example, can come in on a Psychic-type attack and then OHKO Alakazam with STAB Sucker Punch or Dark Pulse.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Alakazam holds the title for the highest Special Attack in the UU tier, so it's a no-brainer that it can utilize a Choice Specs set. However, wielding a Choice Specs set is a mixed blessing in the UU tier. Alakazam will seriously dent a number of things with a stat of 607 or 553, depending on the nature of choice, but its type coverage allows a number of Pokemon to switch in through immunity. The worst possible scenario would be getting trapped by Spiritomb since it is immune to a good portion of this set. All in all, this set attempts to play riskily while dishing out a good amount of damage. This set holds the best possible coverage Alakazam can have.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Psychic will hit anything who doesn't resist it incredibly hard – a possible OHKO for the most part. Signal Beam and Focus Blast round off the coverage nicely. Signal Beam is your only hope against Spiritomb if you predict right. Grass Knot is another alternative if you chose Shadow Ball in the final slot, as it allows Alakazam to hit Milotic for heavy damage. Focus Blast is your main weapon against Steel-types and Chansey. The final slot comes down to three choices, and they each have their own share of usefulness. Trick is an excellent move for restricting Chansey from doing much, while Shadow Ball allows you to OHKO Mismagius. It also allows Alakazam to hit Spiritomb harder than Signal Beam would. Grass Knot is also another option to provide optimal coverage for Alakazam by allowing it to hit nearly every check it has.</p>

<p>Getting rid of Spiritomb beforehand is a good idea before sending out Alakazam. Spiritomb absolutely walls the set with no worry, and it can counteract with Pursuit to remove Alakazam from the entire match. Your best bet is to lure in Spiritomb to ensure it is present on the opponent's team. Swords Dance Absol can come in handy since it usually lures out Spiritomb, and it will faint from a boosted Megahorn. You can work a two-punch combo with Hitmonlee and Houndoom. Hitmonlee can lure out Spiritomb, while Houndoom absorbs Will-O-Wisp directed at Hitmonlee. Houndoom can use a free turn to set up Nasty Plot and sweep on its own. Sometimes Houndoom will lure in Chansey and possibly OHKO it with Fire Blast. With Chansey removed from the match, Alakazam doesn't have to worry about using the inaccurate Focus Blast. Last but not least, if you opt to use Focus Blast, be sure to remove Spiritomb beforehand so Alakazam has an easier time.</p>

<p>For the most part you would want to save Alakazam for the late game once everything is revealed and dented. You can chip away the opponent's HP by using Stealth Rock and Spikes, providing Alakazam a string of OHKOs in the end of the match. As previously mentioned, Omastar does the job well with its ability to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes for Alakazam. Although it's not a requirement, a spinblocker would be helpful for the entire team (including Alakazam) to keep entry hazards present on the field.</p>

[SET]

evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of Alakazam's most prominent drawbacks as a sweeper is his miserable Defense stat, which leaves him completely open to the omnipresent priority attacks in the UU tier. Furthermore, Pursuit users can often OHKO Alakazam even if he decides to stay in, making it extremely difficult to pull off a successful sweep. It would only make sense for Alakazam to utilize Substitute to help it overcome these problems. Substitute shields him from priority hits and also helps Alakazam escape from a possible Pursuit trap from the likes of Spiritomb. Behind a Substitute, Alakazam becomes extremely dangerous, and the opponent will usually be forced to resort to sacrifices in order to break its Substitute. Considering Alakazam's monstrous offensive stats, it isn't difficult to use Substitute on a predicted switch out. Psychic, along with Signal Beam / Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast provide the best possible coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Alakazam possesses three attacks to provide the best possible coverage. In contrast to the OU tier, where Steel-types are ubiquitous, Psychic makes an excellent STAB attack in UU. Psychic can be used to threaten a number of Poison-types who plague the metagame, letting Alakazam take advantage of a free turn to set up Substitute. Focus Blast is an excellent way of dealing damage to Registeel, Aggron, Chansey, and Steelix, all of whom are hit for super effective damage. The final move provides Alakazam a way to hit Spiritomb and Psychic-types. Shadow Ball can be used to inflict more damage on Spiritomb and Mismagius, but Signal Beam's confusion effect might come in handy in order to make it extra-difficult for the opponent to hit you behind the Substitute. Additionally, Signal Beam reduces the chances of a Dark-type Pokemon switching in. Grass Knot is another alternative if Milotic might be problematic, and it also hits Spiritomb for 100 Base Power.</p>

<p>For the most part, Alakazam can sweep on its own, but it still appreciates support. Stealth Rock and Spikes support can increase damage output and punish the switches Alakazam causes. For instance, 252 HP / 116 SpD Spiritomb takes 27% - 32% from Signal Beam, and with Stealth Rock and Spikes support, that can easily turn into a solid 2HKO (assuming Alakazam is behind Substitute). Another noteworthy example is Chansey taking 38% - 44% from a Life Orb Focus Blast. With Stealth Rock and Spikes support, Alakazam has a chance to grab the 2HKO on Chansey. Omastar is one of the few Pokemon in the tier that can provide both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and it is ideally used on the lead slot to dispatch entry hazards as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you're looking to remove Spiritomb without directly using Alakazam, Blaziken makes an exceptional partner since it is resistant to Dark-type attacks, which are often directed at Alakazam. Houndoom can switch into Spiritomb with impunity and can hurt it with Fire Blast.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Calm Mind to boost Alakazam's already-high Special Attack stat to further heights. The best way to pull off a successful sweep with this, because of the lack of Encore, is to reveal it later in the match once your opponent's team has been mostly revealed. This way, Alakazam can avoid being easily trapped by the likes of Spiritomb or walled by Chansey. Psychic is a given on this set since it provides STAB, while Focus Blast lets Alakazam deal heavy damage to the most prominent special walls in the tier: Chansey and Registeel. With a single Calm Mind boost, Focus Blast deals 83% - 97.8% to Registeel, while Chansey takes 56.8% - 67.1%. The final slot boils down to which Pokemon you need Alakazam to hit. Shadow Ball strikes Mismagius and Spiritomb for heavy damage, while Signal Beam can reliably finish off weakened Dark-types without worrying about Focus Blast's 70% accuracy. Additionally, Signal Beam and Shadow Ball allow Alakazam to hit bulky Psychic-types like Uxie and Slowking for super effective damage. Grass Knot can be used in the final slot if inflicting significant damage to Milotic is priority.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Substitute is an option to protect Alakazam from priority moves and Pursuit. It can also guard Alakazam from status and critical hits that bypass Calm Mind. However, if you opt for Substitute, Alakazam will have less coverage. The EV spread is as it is because Alakazam's frailty discourages any defensive investment and it really needs the Speed and Special Attack.</p>

<p>Spikes support is valuable to make this set deadlier. With two layers of Spikes down, Alakazam can OHKO Registeel and 2HKO Chansey with +1 Focus Blast. Offensively, Cloyster fits the bill as a Spikes supporter thanks to its ability to threaten opposing Pokemon with Explosion and check Swellow with Ice Shard.</p>

<p>Spiritomb presents an immediate problem to this set since it has the ability to lock down Alakazam with Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, or Sucker Punch. It is highly recommended that you remove Spiritomb from the match before attempting a sweep; as such, Blaziken or Houndoom make great partners since they can easily switch into Dark- and Ghost-type attacks. Additionally, Houndoom and Blaziken are both immune to Will-O-Wisp, which make checking Spiritomb that much easier if pivoting from a physical attacker.</p>

ability: Synchronize
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Even with Alakazam's monstrous Special Attack stat, he struggles to muscle through dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Milotic. Calm Mind remedies this by giving him the power he needs to defeat said walls, while Encore gives the frail Alakazam opportunities to set up. After a boost, Alakazam will reach a Special Attack stat of 553 or 607, depending on the nature of choice. This, coupled with his high Speed, allows him to sweep unhindered. This set has the potential to hit just as hard as the Specs set, while allowing you the freedom to switch moves at the cost of coverage.</p>

<p>Psychic will dent any Pokemon not resistant or immune to it, while the coverage move helps Alakazam deal with Pokemon who have no trouble with his STAB. Signal Beam is an accurate move that helps deal with Psychic- and Dark-types, while the less reliable Focus Blast allows Alakazam to defeat Registeel, Steelix, and Chansey. If you wish to hit Spiritomb and Milotic as hard as possible, Grass Knot can also be used, but it isn't particularly useful outside of that.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Depending on the coverage move of choice, Alakazam will have trouble with certain Pokemon. Without Focus Blast, Alakazam struggles to harm Registeel, Chansey, and Steelix as they switch in to foil his sweep. If Focus Blast is chosen, Alakazam will be completely useless against Spiritomb and will lose the accuracy of Signal Beam to reliably take out Dark-type threats. Alakazam will also be walled by Psychic-types like Uxie and Mesprit, making Signal Beam superior in terms of reliability and coverage.</p>

<p>Max Speed with a Timid nature is recommended as Alakazam's frailty means he needs to attack as fast as possible before being attacked himself, but the additional power of Modest cannot be ignored. With a Modest nature, Alakazam only needs Stealth Rock to ensure the 2HKO with a +1 Focus Blast on Chansey. Leftovers is the preferred item to heal entry hazard damage and aid setting up, while Life Orb gives Alakazam a further power boost. With Life Orb, Timid Alakazam has a very slight chance to OHKO standard Registeel (using Focus Blast) with Stealth Rock after a Calm Mind, and has a guaranteed OHKO with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. The ability choice is up to preference, as bouncing back status with Synchronize is useful, as is Inner Focus for eliminating Ambipom and Technitop as they attempt to flinch you with Fake Out.</p>

<p>Alakazam's frailty doesn't allow him many opportunities to set up, and this is where Encore comes in. Encoring setup moves such as Stealth Rock or recovery moves from walls gives him the time he needs to set up without fear of retaliation. With proper prediction, Alakazam can switch in on set-up sweepers such as Toxicroak or Leafeon and foil their attempts at a sweep, while beginning his own. Substitute users are also susceptible to Encore, including SubSeeders and SubPunchers. Encore also allows Alakazam to defeat revenge killers who rely on Sucker Punch to stop him, such as Houndoom, Toxicroak, and Absol. Encoring Sucker Punch allows Alakazam to continue Calm Minding while the opponent remains helpless, and after Sucker Punch's PP wears out, Alakazam can KO the Pokemon with the appropriate move. Alakazam is best played from mid to late game when the majority of your opponent's team is revealed and you've scouted potential threats. Even if the opportunity to sweep hasn't presented itself, Alakazam can fire off a few attacks and Encore key moves to support his team until he can finally attempt a sweep.</p>

<p>Although Alakazam hits hard on his own, he still appreciates support from his team. Entry hazards are especially useful, as they allow Alakazam to get KOs he otherwise wouldn't on Pokemon such as Chansey and specially defensive Milotic. Omastar makes a good partner, as he has access to all forms of entry hazards and makes an effective lead. Blaziken and Houndoom make ideal partners for their ability to get rid of Spiritomb and any other threats who may pester Alakazam with the loss of one of his coverage moves. Venusaur can lure Registeel, put it to sleep, and begin setting up Swords Dance. Venusaur can also KO Milotic before she can become a hindrance to Alakazam. Pokemon who can take priority attacks aimed at Alakazam are also recommended. Slowbro is a good choice as his high Defense allows him to easily sponge hits from Arcanine and Azumarill. Hitmonlee can eliminate Chansey and pesky Steel-types with his Fighting STAB while hitting Spiritomb hard with Stone Edge. Dugtrio gets a special mention for being able to trap and defeat Registeel, Chansey, and weakened Steelix on his own, which is especially useful for Alakazam who choose Signal Beam as their coverage move.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to tone Alakazam down offensively in order to support your entire team with its unique move: Encore. Much like the previous sets, Substitute is used to ensure Alakazam is protected from Pursuit and priority hits. However, the tried-and-true strategy with Substitute is used in conjunction with Encore. The opponent is forced to attack you when you are behind the Substitute, giving Alakazam a chance to use Encore. If the opponent decides to use a Dark-type attack, for instance, you can bring in someone who appreciates a free turn to set up, such as Blaziken. Even without a Substitute, Encore can be useful on something that decides to set up on Alakazam.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Much like the previous set, Psychic is already a given, and the choice is between Signal Beam and Focus Blast. Since this set aims to support the team instead of dishing out damage, the choice for the final slot isn't a huge concern. Signal Beam will hit Spiritomb for neutral damage, while Focus Blast will hit Steel-types and Chansey for super effective damage.</p>

<p>Take advantage of Alakazam's ability to lure in certain attacks. Dark-type attacks will give Blaziken a free turn to set up Swords Dance. Other candidates include Aggron, who can take advantage of a free turn to set up Substitute and Magnet Rise – a tough task to accomplish without support. Equally effective offensive partners are Pokemon who can switch into opponents locked into Ghost-type moves. Linoone and Ursaring are ideal partners since they both appreciate a free turn to set up due to their miserable defensive stats. Overall, anyone who enjoys a free turn to set up could be considered as a partner.</p>

<p>Since Alakazam creates multiple switch-outs by using Encore, it would only make sense to fit in both Stealth Rock and Spikes to rack up residual damage. Omastar seems to fill this job correctly since it's capable of using them in the same moveset. If you're looking to split the work, Uxie and Cloyster can exchange attacks dished at each other and use a free turn to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Alakazam can fill a nice role in the lead slot thanks to Taunt and its ability Inner Focus, which prevents Fake Out leads from flinching it. In general, this set fares well against a number of popular leads in the UU tier, aiming to dish as much damage as possible with excellent coverage all-around while preventing an easy set up for the opponent. Taunt makes a fantastic opening move on leads such as Omastar and Cloyster since both of them enjoy deploying entry hazards early in the match; it also prevents Uxie from setting up Stealth Rock and paralyzing you with Thunder Wave. Psychic is Alakazam's obligatory STAB move, and it 2HKOes almost any lead that does not outright resist it. Focus Blast will OHKO a number of leads including Omastar, Cloyster, Ambipom, and Snover, but if its accuracy makes you nervous, Counter is also another alternative to look for in order to OHKO Ambipom after it uses Fake Out. Signal Beam is essential on this set in order to hit Uxie for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]


<p>The choice between Modest and Timid nature is ultimately a choice between power and speed. A Modest nature provides Alakazam with a way to deal more damage to Uxie and Spiritomb, while a Timid nature ensures Alakazam is not outpaced by Dugtrio, Sceptile, and opposing Alakazam in later stages of the match.</p>

<p>Flying- and Fire-types are excellent partners with Alakazam since it normally shuts down Stealth Rock users in the start of the match. Moltres, Swellow, Arcanine, and Magmortar enjoy coming in later when Stealth Rock is not present. Alakazam not only shuts down the opponent's Stealth Rock user, but it can also severely damage many common leads. Kangaskhan makes an exceptional offensive partner alongside Alakazam since Focus Blast destroys Omastar, one of its few checks in UU. Spiritomb is a match made in hell for Alakazam since it can't deal any significant damage to Spiritomb without some form of boost. Blaziken and Houndoom make excellent teammates, as they are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can check Spiritomb well. A number of Fighting-types including Hitmonlee, Hariyama, and Hitmontop appreciate it when Uxie is dented early in the match.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite Alakazam's paper thin defenses, you have to consider its blistering Speed stat and ability to create an opening for setting up dual screens. Furthermore, Inner Focus allows Alakazam to bypass the flinch from Ambipom's Fake Out and set up both Reflect and Light Screen. Taking all of this into account, Alakazam can open up opportunities for your entire team, and it can make Baton Passing sufficiently easier.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Encore is the crux of the set because it prevents the opponent from attacking you if it sets up, and Alakazam can take advantage of the free turn to set up dual screens. For the final slot, it ultimately comes down to what you decide to do. Taunt restricts the opponent's Ambipom from utilizing Taunt on you; however, the chances of Ambipom using Taunt are very slim since many of Ambipom leads expect Alakazam to attack. Generally, Taunt shuts down the opponent from setting up anything. If you feel the need to space in an attack move, Psychic could go over Taunt. If you decide to place Psychic in the final slot, Taunt could be used in the third slot.</p>

<p>The EVs are allocated to outpace Ambipom – the third fastest lead it will face behind Alakazam and the rare Electrode. 252 HP EVs maximize its ability to take hits. The surplus is dumped to Defense EVs in order to take a Fake Out from Ambipom and survive the following U-turn after setting up Reflect.</p>

<p>The number of partners for this particular set is endless since anyone appreciates dual screen support. However, there are certain Pokemon who need dual screens as a staple. Ursaring absolutely needs dual screens to set up Swords Dance and deal huge amount of damage while cushioning the blows. Other candidates include Absol, Houndoom, and Blaziken. These three are quite frail, and they can use a free turn to set up their respective stat-up moves. Rhyperior gets a special mention since Solid Rock and dual screens mesh well together, only making it extra-difficult to take down.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Alakazam can fill the support role fairly well with moves such as Knock Off and Thunder Wave. However, it is extremely frail and will struggle to find the time to use such moves. Recover is another option, as it gives Alakazam the ability to stay in on attacks such as Chansey's Seismic Toss, but the resulting loss in offensive coverage is usually not worth this benefit. Snatch is a great move, but not really usable on Alakazam, since your opponent will usually just try to OHKO Alakazam as soon as possible and not bother using the setup moves that Snatch works on.</p>

<p>Offensively, Alakazam also has quite a few options. While Charge Beam might seem inferior to Calm Mind, it gives Alakazam an extra offensive move while retaining the ability to boost that awesome Special Attack. The boost from Charge Beam is not reliable, however, and this strategy is only recommended when you need to make room for Encore or another support move. Alakazam also learns Shock Wave, but you will rarely find a use for it, since few Pokemon take more from Shock Wave than they do from Psychic. Furthermore, Hidden Power Electric is stronger, and thus Shock Wave should only be used on sets where Alakazam is already using a Hidden Power of another type. Energy Ball and Grass Knot are great options if you need coverage against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types; however, this is only useful on certain teams, since Psychic will usually do enough damage. Hidden Power Fighting can be considered over Focus Blast if you are worried about the latter's accuracy; however, the damage output will be disappointing against Pokemon such as Chansey, Omastar, and Registeel.</p>

<p>Lum Berry can be used in combination with Synchronize, letting you switch into a move such as Thunder Wave or Toxic, inflicting the status effect on your opponent while Alakazam is essentially unscathed. Salac and Petaya Berry are also options, since either boost makes it a little easier for Alakazam to sweep; however, Alakazam really misses Leftovers, especially on sets with Substitute. Furthermore, with the omnipresence of residual damage, namely sandstorm, Alakazam will be quickly worn out without the aid of Leftovers.

<p>On offensive sets, it is recommended you use a Timid nature, 252 Special Attack EVs, and at least 216 Speed EVs to outrun any base 115 Speed Pokemon. If you are not worried about outspeeding Ambipom, you can give Alakazam 176 Speed EVs, which will outrun any base 110 Speed Pokemon (who max out at 350 Speed). On the other hand, 252 EVs in Speed lets you tie with other Alakazam, Sceptile, and Dugtrio. A Modest nature is perfectly viable on the Aggressive Lead set since the only Pokemon who will outpace it are Ambipom and opposing Alakazam. Ambipom can't OHKO Alakazam thanks to Focus Sash, and it dies to Focus Blast or Counter. Furthermore, Alakazam won't be sticking around for a long time so you don't have to worry about a possible Dugtrio or Sceptile encounter. The only drawback for using a Modest nature is getting outpaced by opposing Alakazam.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Don't expect a broad list of counters because there aren't many that lie in UU. However, Spiritomb is by far the best counter for almost every set thanks to its Psychic- and Fighting-type immunity. Spiritomb can dispose of Alakazam with Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, Dark Pulse, and Sucker Punch. To a smaller extent, Drapion and Skuntank can check Alakazam fairly well thanks to their unique typing. However, 252 HP / 252 SpD Drapion takes 44% - 52% from a Life Orb Focus Blast, so it's probably a good idea to bring him in on a predicted Psychic to avoid a possible 2HKO. Skuntank has Sucker Punch and Pursuit to keep Alakazam second guessing. On a set that doesn't utilize any form of stat-boosting move or item, Chansey is your best bet as it can use Seismic Toss until it eventually drops dead. An Alakazam who is lacking Grass Knot will have problems bypassing a Specially Defensive Milotic since it can take a hit or two and hurt Alakazam with Surf.</p>

<p>Although they're not considered counters, priority hits will seriously injure Alakazam or possibly OHKO it. If Alakazam is not behind a Substitute, feel free to use your respective priority hits when the opening is there. Some noteworthy priority hits that can OHKO include Absol's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet.</p>
