[Overview]

<p>Exeggutor is an all-around phenomenal Pokemon capable of playing many roles, both offensive and defensive. Exeggutor faces stiff competition from Venusaur, but it has a few qualities that make it a deadly sweeper, including numerous resistances, STAB Psychic, and a higher Special Attack stat. It also possesses a slew of support options, including Sunny Day, Trick Room, and dual screens. The only thing holding back Exeggutor is its relatively low Speed and Special Defense stats, but its aforementioned assets are enough to outweigh its shortcomings.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set exploits Exeggutor's ability to deal high damage to nearly anything. Exeggutor's valuable resistances to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves allow it to switch in on many common Pokemon and begin attacking. Many of these Pokemon happen to be slower than Exeggutor, which makes up for its relatively low Speed. There are only a few safe switch-ins to this set, the most reliable being the easily-exploitable Chansey and Registeel.</p>

<p>Psychic and Leaf Storm are strong STAB moves to work with and have pretty good coverage alongside each other. Psychic is the better move to fire off the bat as it can hit many of Exeggutor's soft-counters, like Fire-types and Venusaur, for high damage. Leaf Storm hits the selection of Pokemon who can withstand Psychic, such as Milotic and Spiritomb. Sleep Powder allows Exeggutor to neutralize potential counters, and Synthesis allows Exeggutor to replenish its health, making it more difficult to take down. Leech Seed can be an alternate option if you want to wear down Registeel and Chansey while they are asleep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Exeggutor's damage output, while the given Speed allows it to comfortably outpace Adamant Aggron. Placing a few additional EVs into Speed can be used to safely outpace the other Pokemon who linger around 200 Speed, such as defensive Milotic and Venusaur. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to give Exeggutor more bulk. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 132 Def / 124 Spe with a Modest nature can be used if you really need to make use of Exeggutor's resistances to combat physical threats like Torterra, Leafeon, Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Fighting-types. It still has a very respectable 314 Special Attack stat even with no investment, which ensures that Exeggutor doesn't turn into an inferior Tangrowth.</p>

<p>While this set might seem outclassed by Venusaur due to its lower Speed, Exeggutor has a couple of niches that make it the better choice for certain teams. It boasts a Ground-type resistance and better physical bulk than Venusaur, allowing it to more easily switch into Donphan, Torterra, and Rhyperior. Psychic is also a better STAB move to pair with Leaf Storm than Sludge Bomb in terms of type coverage.</p>

<p>Chansey and Registeel are the safest switch-ins to this set. The former has a high Special Defense stat and can easily beat Exeggutor with Thunder Wave or Toxic, while the latter resists both of Exeggutor's STAB moves and can beat it with Thunder Wave and repeated Iron Heads. Therefore, Substitute Torterra makes a good offensive partner to Exeggutor, as it can easily switch into and threaten out both Registeel and Chansey, taking advantage of the predicted switch to create a Substitute. Furthermore, Registeel is commonly paired with Milotic, and Torterra can easily break this core apart with its dual STAB moves.</p>

<p>Exeggutor is rather slow and specially frail, and it won't enjoy taking super effective attacks from Fire- and Ghost-types or from specially oriented Venusaur. For this reason, Exeggutor pairs up well with the infamous Registeel and Milotic core, which can easily deal with the most common combination of offensive threats that Exeggutor has trouble blowing off. These include Rotom, Mismagius, Venusaur, and Arcanine, to name a few. Both of them also provide opportunities for Exeggutor to switch in on—Milotic draws in physical Grass-types, while Registeel attracts Ground- and Fighting-type moves.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Leaf Storm
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Low Kick / Explosion
item: Life Orb
nature: Rash
evs: 40 Atk / 252 SpA / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is perhaps one of the most difficult sets to switch into due to the raw power it commands. Life Orb provides an extra kick to Exeggutor's attacks, allowing it to muscle its way through soft checks such as Houndoom (who even has a chance of being OHKOed by Leaf Storm with Stealth Rock in play), Arcanine, and Mismagius. As opposed to the previous set, Leaf Storm can be used more freely since Life Orb allows it to take a sizable chunk from most Pokemon's HP, even when resisted. This set utilizes a "hit-and-run" strategy, so using your best attack when the opportunity arises is preferable.</p>

<p>Sleep Powder is a given on this set as it allows Exeggutor to place its initial switch-in into a deep slumber. Leaf Storm and Psychic are Exeggutor's obligatory STAB moves. Low Kick can be squeezed in the last slot to hit Registeel or Chansey on the switch or to damage them while they are asleep. Low Kick deals 47% average to 252 HP/ 0 Def Registeel and 41% average to 4 HP / 252 SpD Chansey, while also hitting Houndoom for super effective damage. Explosion can be used over Low Kick to go out with a bang once Exeggutor's health has been significantly reduced. Its huge power ensures that it will dent most Pokemon who don't resist it. However, Low Kick is the safer and more reliable option for the most part.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Running a Speed-boosting nature is an option to outspeed Adamant Torterra, Jolly Aggron, and minimum Speed Drapion, Uxie, and Rotom, but is inadvisable as the power loss generally isn't worth it. This set focuses more on punishing slower teams, and Exeggutor needs all the power it can get.</p>

<p>There is no safe switch-in to this set due to the massive power Exeggutor holds and its ability to hurt everything with the appropriate move. However, one can exploit Exeggutor through smart switching and utilizing resistances, and take advantage of its relatively low Speed to threaten it. For example, if you predict the Leaf Storm, you should withdraw to Moltres or Venusaur; predict the Psychic, and you should bring in Absol, Drapion, or Houndoom. Uxie and Scyther can also switch into Psychic or Leaf Storm, respectively, and threaten Exeggutor with a fast U-turn. Choice Band Spiritomb can also switch into both Psychic and Low Kick and scare it off with the threat of Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch, potentially catching it with Pursuit.</p>

<p>Offensive Milotic pairs with this very well, as it has trouble with opposing Chansey and bulky Waters, both of which Exeggutor can weaken or take out, consequently paving the way for Milotic to sweep. Defensively, special defensive Clefable is a good partner as it draws in Fighting-type moves to give Exeggutor switch-ins, while also providing Wish support to Exeggutor to heal Life Orb or other residual damage.</p>

[SET]
name: Sunny Day
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: SolarBeam
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Explosion / Sleep Powder
item: Heat Rock / Life Orb
nature: Rash
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set allows Exeggutor to patch up its middling Speed with Sunny Day by means of Chlorophyll. This set can work as both a supporter of Sunny Day or a sweeper; the former can take advantage of the free switch granted by Sleep Powder to set up Sunny Day (for eight turns thanks to Heat Rock), while the latter can deal huge damage with Life Orb-boosted attacks.</p>

<p>Like the other sets, this set is difficult to switch into due to the power it provides. Psychic and SolarBeam severely damage most of the UU metagame, Registeel and Chansey the most notable exceptions. The added Speed means that smart switching through abusing resistances will not work as well against Exeggutor, as it can fire off the appropriate move the next turn. The choice in the final slot depend entirely on how you decide to use Exeggutor. Sleep Powder is favored over Explosion if you want it to mainly be a Sunny Day supporter, while Explosion is preferred if you wish to purely sweep instead. Explosion will hit most things for hard damage and can OHKO Chansey.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Exeggutor is a useful asset on a Sunny Day team as it has a powerful secondary STAB in the form of Psychic, which can be used to get rid of opposing Grass/Poison and Fire-types that stand in the way of more typical sun sweepers. Hidden Power Fire will gain a pseudo-STAB boost in the sun, and can deal with Registeel.</p>

<p>Fire-types with SolarBeam are great partners if you want to use this on something other than a full sun-based team; Moltres, Arcanine, or Houndoom can all wreck bulky Waters with super effective SolarBeams and most other things with boosted Fire Blasts, while Exeggutor is great at luring and taking out opposing Fire-types and Chansey. Chlorophyll users such as Victreebel, Tangrowth, and Shiftry can make use of the eight turns of sun Exeggutor can provide.</p>

[SET]

nature: Jolly / Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The combination of Sleep Powder, dual screens, and Explosion makes Exeggutor a brilliant support Pokemon. It gets many opportunities to switch in on one of its six resistances and support the team. Explosion is an absolute staple on this set, as it allows Exeggutor to safely bring in the next Pokemon after providing dual screens. If you prefer to keep Exeggutor for the entire match, then you can swap Explosion with Leaf Storm; however, one might find it too difficult to switch in Exeggutor the second time due to its low Speed, and the dual screening process will be more difficult now that your opponent knows you have Exeggutor in the wings. Leaf Storm can also be used over Sleep Powder if you have another sleep inducer elsewhere on your team; it is still a powerful attack without any Special Attack investment.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Jolly should obviously be used if Explosion is the only attack, but if you're running Leaf Storm as well then it is up to personal preference whether you choose to weaken your Leaf Storm or your Explosion with your nature.</p>

<p>Rhyperior and Houndoom both work really well with this Exeggutor since they are both excellent at drawing in moves that Exeggutor resists, giving it opportunities to switch in. Additionally, both of these threats are exceptionally deadly behind dual screens—Houndoom is not OHKOed by Milotic's Surf or Azumarill's Aqua Jet and can take them out in return with boosted Dark Pulses. With the combination of natural bulk, Solid Rock, and dual screens, Rhyperior is a vicious threat and can set up Substitute or Rock Polish. Swords Dance Kabutops also works in the same manner as Rhyperior, but it is more potent offensively after a Swords Dance boost.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Trick Room

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Exeggutor makes a very reliable Trick Room user, as it can almost guarantee a free turn to set up by using Sleep Powder. It can then hit hard with a Life Orb boosted Leaf Storm off its enormous base 125 Special Attack stat or simply get out of the way with Explosion in order to let in another Trick Room sweeper. Exeggutor is relatively bulky and is by no means obliged to explode straightaway: it can try to sweep by itself with Leaf Storm more than once in a game.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Rhyperior and Marowak both lure in Grass- and Water-type moves on which Exeggutor can set up. Octillery can draw in Grass- and Electric-type moves, and once Exeggutor has provided Trick Room support, Octillery can sweep with Water Spout.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Exeggutor can use AncientPower to deal with Moltres and Charizard on the switch. However, it has limited coverage outside of those two, and Psychic already deals high damage. Exeggutor can act as a physical wall when needed thanks to its unique typing and access to Wish, but one must keep in mind that Tangrowth has better defensive capabilities and is generally the better option. Leaf Storm is also illegal with Wish. Exeggutor can run a physical set with access to Swords Dance and a deadly STAB attack in Wood Hammer, but the Pokemon it usually draws in are always the same and you're better off utilizing its higher Special Attack stat. The only benefit of using a physical set is catching Chansey off-guard. Exeggutor can also run a Choice Specs set if you want to strip a sizable chunk out of nearly anything with Leaf Storm, but Life Orb provides sufficient power anyway, and it is usually essential for Exeggutor to not be locked in on one move lest it grant threats like Moltres and Spiritomb free switch-ins. Stun Spore can also be used on the offensive sets over Sleep Powder if you wish to paralyze faster threats on the switch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Every time you switch in a potential counter, you risk Exeggutor putting it to sleep, paralyzing it, or Exploding. It is important to keep in mind that your switch-in is never completely safe.</p>

<p>The best method with dealing with Exeggutor is figuring out which set it is using. The bulky offense set holds Leftovers and is soundly beaten by Chansey and Registeel thanks to their enormous special bulk. The Life Orb set can be beaten by smart switching through resistances. Anything that is faster and can threaten it with a super effective move, such as Venusaur, Moltres, and Arcanine, is considered a check. Choice Band Spiritomb can switch into Low Kick and Psychic and place Exeggutor in a checkmate position with the threat of one of Sucker Punch, Pursuit, or Shadow Sneak. For the most part, you'll want to play against Exeggutor intelligently and limit its switch-ins.</p>
