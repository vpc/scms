[Overview]

<p>With excellent offensive stats and a decent movepool, Magmortar can be a huge threat in UU. However, it's cursed with being a Fire-type, thus losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock upon switching in. Magmortar's Speed is also only average, leaving it vulnerable to faster sweepers, provided that they can switch in safely. What sets Magmortar apart from other Fire-types like Blaziken and Typhlosion is its access to Thunderbolt, which gives it an easier time against bulky Water-types like Slowbro. As long as you can get around Magmortar's weaknesses, it makes an effective sweeper.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker 
move 1: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Cross Chop
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive / Hasty
evs: 16 Atk / 252 SpA / 240 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Magmortar's greatest strength lies in its ability to deal with both the physical and special walls of UU, thanks to its sky-high base 125 Special Attack and solid base 95 Attack. These are backed by Magmortar's extremely diverse movepool and the 1.3x power boost from Life Orb, turning Magmortar into a mixed attacker who can blast through the strongest walls of UU.</p>

<p>Fire Blast is Magmortar's main attacking move that can deal deadly damage to almost every Pokemon who doesn't resist it. Thunderbolt is an ideal move on Magmortar, as it OHKOes Moltres and gives Magmortar coverage over bulky Water-types. The third slot is chosen based on personal preference. Hidden Power Grass is usually the more reliable option because it allows Magmortar to hit a wider range of Pokemon, including Rhyperior and the Ground-types who would otherwise wall this set. It is also Magmortar's strongest move against Lanturn. Hidden Power Ice is the other alternative; while the only notable Pokemon it hits is Altaria, it still scores super effective hits on Ground-types (however, it doesn't OHKO Rhyperior), making it a good alternative option. The last move, Cross Chop, allows Magmortar to destroy Chansey, who would otherwise wall this set completely. With Stealth Rock in play, the combination of Fire Blast and Cross Chop has a high chance of KOing it. Cross Chop also OHKOes Houndoom, another troublesome Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Speed-boosting nature is chosen for this set, as it allows Magmortar to outspeed Milotic, Feraligatr, and all max Speed Pokemon with Base 80 Speed and a positive nature, including Venusaur and Blaziken. The choice of nature depends on what you want Magmortar to take less damage from. A Naive nature allows Magmortar to take less damage from physical priority attacks (such as Fake Out or Mach Punch), while a Hasty nature allows Magmortar to take less from special attacks like Leaf Storm. Life Orb is the item of choice on this set, allowing Magmortar to switch freely between attacks and give it a welcomed power boost. Here are some damage calculations demonstrating the power of this Magmortar:</p>

<h3>Damage Calculations</h3>
<ul class="damage_calculations">
<li>Fire Blast vs. 52 HP / 0 SpD Adamant Donphan - 109.71% - 131.44%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 240 SpD Bold Weezing - 73.95% - 87.42%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 216 SpD Careful Registeel - 74.17% - 87.91%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Bold Claydol - 65.12% - 77.16%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 116 SpD Careful Spiritomb - 61.51% - 73.02%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 100 SpD Calm Clefable - 55.58% - 65.48%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs. 0 HP / 252 SpD Calm Chansey - 26.83% - 31.82%</li>
<li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Bold Slowbro - 79.18% - 93.40%</li>
<li>Thunderbolt vs. 248 HP / 0 SpD Bold Milotic - 54.96% - 65.13%</li>
<li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 56 SpD Calm Milotic - 47.20% - 55.83%</li>
<li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Bold Blastoise - 69.06% - 81.76%</li>
<li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Bold Cloyster - 107.23% - 126.31%</li>
<li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 136 HP / 0 SpD Adamant Rhyperior - 115.55% - 136.29%</li>
<li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Quagsire - 91.37% - 108.62%</li>
<li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 40 HP / 252 SpD Calm Lanturn - 41.39% - 48.87%</li>
<li>Cross Chop vs. 0 HP / 252 Def Calm Chansey - 61.15% - 72.07%</li>
</ul>

<p>These calculations effectively portray Magmortar's raw power. Any of these Pokemon who switches into Fire Blast is then KOed by one of Magmortar's coverage moves (with the sole exception of Lanturn). For example, if a physically defensive Milotic switches in on Fire Blast, it is then KOed by Thunderbolt (assuming Stealth Rock is up). The calculations also show the importance of Stealth Rock, which allows Magmortar to gain some very important OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p>

<p>Despite its excellent attacking prowess, this Magmortar generally has a short lifespan. Stealth Rock chips off a whopping 25% of Magmortar's health every time it switches in. This, coupled with recoil damage from Life Orb, can often lead to Magmortar's early demise. Therefore, Rapid Spin support is invaluable to Magmortar, as it allows Magmortar to switch in much more freely in order to fire off its powerful attacks. The two Rapid Spinners who have the greatest synergy with Magmortar are Claydol and Blastoise. Claydol can switch into Ground- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Magmortar, spin away entry hazards, and then proceed to set up Stealth Rock to aid Magmortar. Blastoise also makes a great partner to Magmortar because it can come in on Water- and Fire-type attacks easily; moreover, it has access to Foresight, which allows it to spin on Ghost-types. Wish support from the likes of Leafeon and Chansey is also greatly appreciated by Magmortar, since it can restore health lost due to entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and other forms of residual damage.</p>

<p>Magmortar pairs well with Pokemon who either defensively complement it or take advantage of the large holes that Magmortar can punch into the opposing team. Toxicroak makes a great partner to Magmortar, as it can come in on Water-type attacks directed at Magmortar, set up Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, and attempt to sweep. Thanks to its typing and ability, Toxicroak can also come in on numerous priority attacks, such as Aqua Jet or Mach Punch, which greatly threaten Magmortar. Physical variants of Toxicroak often lure in Will-O-Wisp users, such as Spiritomb, whom Magmortar can freely switch into. Due to its ability to eliminate bulky Waters with Thunderbolt, Magmortar can open up opportunities for Pokemon such as Rock Polish Rhyperior to sweep. Rhyperior can also come in on Thunder Wave from defensive Pokemon whom Magmortar cannot OHKO, such as Uxie, and then proceed to set up the following turn.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that the same set with a spread of 120 Atk / 136 SpA / 252 Spe EVs can be used in OU in order to make Magmortar somewhat usable in this tier. However, most of the time you will find a better option in Pokemon such as Infernape, for instance, which is faster than Magmortar and doesn't need to worry about Stealth Rock damage that much.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker 
move 1: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
item: Life Orb / Expert Belt
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 16 HP / 252 SpA / 240 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Magmortar's excellent Special Attack and usable Speed. Fire Blast is a powerful STAB attack, though you may use Flamethrower if you prefer perfect accuracy. Thunderbolt allows Magmortar to hit bulky Water-types like Milotic and Flying-types such as Moltres super effectively. Focus Blast lets Magmortar strike Regirock and Houndoom for deadly damage. Hidden Power Ice allows Magmortar to OHKO Altaria, while Hidden Power Grass is used to OHKO Rhyperior and Quagsire. Life Orb is the preferred item, although you may choose an Expert Belt if you wish to be free from recoil damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Timid nature and 240 EVs in Speed, Magmortar has the ability to outrun all positive natured base 80 Pokemon, while also beating Offensive Milotic by one point. Max Special Attack is vital, as it grants Magmortar's attacks more power behind them. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Magmortar a small defensive boost, while retaining an odd number that allows it to switch into Stealth Rock five times.</p>

<p>Being a Fire-type, Magmortar loses a quarter of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock. Support from Rapid Spin is a necessity, as Magmortar will also be losing health from Life Orb recoil, making a sweep much more difficult. Donphan is an excellent user of Rapid Spin as it can switch into physically-based Rock- and Ground-type moves aimed at Magmortar, while hitting Ghost-types with Assurance.</p>

<p>Without any physical attacks, this set has trouble getting past special walls, primarily Chansey and Clefable. There are numerous ways to deal with this problem. The first way is to use Choice Band Dugtrio, who can trap them with its ability, and 2HKO them with Earthquake. Mixed Blaziken is also an option to deal with special walls, as it can lure them in with specially-based moves and hit them with Superpower. Finally, Taunt Mismagius can shut down most special walls with ease and setup with Nasty Plot. After three boosts from Nasty Plot, Mismagius can 2HKO Chansey with Hidden Power Fighting.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Fire Blast / Overheat 
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
nature: Modest / Timid
evs: 40 Def / 252 SpA / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set uses Choice items to either boost Magmortar's Speed or Special Attack to an overwhelming level. Fire Blast and Overheat allow Magmortar to leave large dents on a variety of opponents; Fire Blast is the most reliable choice as it doesn't lower Magmortar's Special Attack after use, which is more suitable for late-game cleaning, but Overheat deals more damage and has better uses earlier on. Flamethrower can be used if you would rather have perfect accuracy over power. Thunderbolt allows Magmortar to damage Water-types like Milotic and Flying-types such as Moltres for super effective damage. Focus Blast is used to blast opponents who resist or are immune to Fire-type moves, such as Regirock and Houndoom. Hidden Power Ice deals huge damage to Altaria, while providing excellent coverage alongside Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used to OHKO Quagsire and Rhyperior, who take less damage from any other move listed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Modest nature and a Choice Scarf, Magmortar reaches 384 Speed, outrunning max Speed Swellow and everything below. Using more Speed is unnecessary as Magmortar won't outrun anything notable. Max Special Attack gives Magmortar added power behind its attacks. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense for additional physical bulk. When using Choice Specs, a Timid nature along with an EV spread of 16 HP / 252 SpA / 240 Spe is recommended. This allows Magmortar to outrun maximum Speed Modest Milotic.</p>

<p>Since Choice Magmortar will have to switch out frequently, removing Stealth Rock from the field via Rapid Spin is a must. Donphan is an excellent choice as it can switch into Rock- and Ground-type moves that Magmortar is weak to and smack most spinblockers hard with Earthquake and Assurance, while also setting up Stealth Rock for Magmortar. Hitmontop is another great Rapid Spinner as it has Foresight to eliminate Ghost-types' immunity to Rapid Spin.</p>

<p>Like the Special Sweeper set, this set has trouble with Chansey, who can survive even Choice Specs Focus Blast with ease. Physically-based sweepers such as Hitmontop are great teammates as they can eliminate Chansey with their powerful STAB moves. Taunt Mismagius is another option as Chansey is unable to damage it with Seismic Toss. Mismagius can use this time to set up Nasty Plot and 2HKO it with +6 Hidden Power Fighting.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Fire Blast / Lava Plume
move 4: Thunderbolt
item: Expert Belt / Leftovers
nature: Mild
evs: 48 Atk / 228 SpA / 232 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Like the first set, this set also attempts to break through your opponent's walls, but this time with a combination of Substitute and Focus Punch. Substitute grants Magmortar safety from crippling status moves, while also giving protection for Focus Punch's charging turn. Focus Punch deals solid damage to any Pokemon who is not hit super effectively by Fire Blast and Thunderbolt. Fire Blast and Lava Plume both provide reliable STAB; the choice depends on whether you prefer higher power in Fire Blast or higher accuracy and burn rate with Lava Plume. Thunderbolt damages bulky Water-types like Milotic, as well as Flying-types like Moltres. The item choice depends on the player's preference; Expert Belt boosts the power of Magmortar's attacks, while Leftovers help regain HP lost from using Substitute.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>232 Speed EVs give Magmortar the ability to outrun all neutral base 80 Pokemon, which includes Venusaur and Blaziken. 48 Attack EVs ensure that Magmortar OHKOes Chansey with an Expert Belt boosted Focus Punch after it switches into Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack, giving Magmortar more power behind its specially-based moves.</p>

<p>Support from Rapid Spin is even more important on this set as Magmortar's HP is already lowered with Substitute, which means that you want to preserve as much HP as possible by preventing residual damage. Claydol is a decent choice for this role as it can switch into Rock- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Magmortar, while providing extra support with dual screens and Stealth Rock of its own. It shares a weakness to Water-type moves, however.</p>

<p>As Magmortar will be losing a lot of its health due to Substitute and possibly entry hazards, Wish support is an excellent option. Chansey and Clefable are excellent partners for Magmortar as they can cripple the opponent with status, while providing reliable support with Wish. Clefable also has access to Encore to stop set-up sweepers from sweeping.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Magmortar has an amazing movepool filled with many viable options. With Will-O-Wisp, Magmortar can burn physical threats more reliably than by using Lava Plume. Taunt can be used to stop any opponent who attempts to set up on Magmortar or cripple it with status moves. A SunnyBeamer set can be used to some success, but Magmortar's average Speed can make this difficult. Psychic is available to hit Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Blaziken super effectively, though it provides little coverage compared to other moves. Magmortar can utilize a Choice Band set thanks to its decent physical movepool consisting of Cross Chop, Earthquake, Thunderpunch, and Fire Punch, but Blaziken does this better due to its higher Attack and Fighting STAB. Mach Punch may be used for priority, allowing Magmortar to overcome its Speed issue. Belly Drum is a gimmicky option for Magmortar and it can have a huge payoff at the cost of major team support; however, Magmortar is unable to utilize Mach Punch along with Belly Drum due to legality issues, greatly lowering the effectiveness of the set. Using a SubSalac set is also an option, though it's very risky due to the prevalence of Stealth Rock and priority users.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to its huge Special Attack and threatening movepool, Magmortar is quite difficult to counter. The best way to defeat Magmortar is to figure out what set it's running and predict accordingly. Bulky Water-types such as Lanturn, Milotic, and Azumarill are great initial switch-ins to Magmortar. Lanturn is an excellent counter due to its immunity to Thunderbolt, thanks to Volt Absorb, resistance to Fire-type moves, great overall bulk, and access to STAB Surf to hit Magmortar super effectively. Milotic can switch into Fire Blast, survive the incoming Thunderbolt, and then strike Magmortar back super effectively with STAB Surf. Azumarill can switch into any Fire-type moves and hit Magmortar with Aqua Jet before it gets a chance to attack. With Sandstorm support, Regirock is a decent counter as it takes little damage from Magmortar's special attacks due to its boosted Special Defense, and can smash Magmortar with STAB Rock-typed attacks.</p>

<p>Altaria makes a great counter to Magmortar without Hidden Power Ice courtesy of its great defensive stats, resistances to Fighting- and Fire-type moves, neutrality to Thunderbolt, and access to Earthquake. Chansey can take on any set without physical attacks thanks to its high special bulk. It can cripple Magmortar with Thunder Wave and weaken it with Seismic Toss, but it must beware of taking too many hits from Focus Blast. Hariyama is a solid counter as it takes reduced damage from Magmortar's STAB Fire-type moves thanks to Thick Fat, and its high HP and decent defenses make it hard to take down with any other move. Hariyama can then proceed to destroy Magmortar with Stone Edge.</p>
