[Overview]

<p>A number of people questioned Snover's ability to take over Abomasnow's job. Many people thought Snover would never see the light of day in UU play due to his lackluster stats and his total of 7 weaknesses. However, Snover can bring many positive things to the table. First and foremost, his ability activates infinite hail, making him a standard on all hail-based teams. Secondly, his typing, surprisingly enough, allows him to beat most of the bulky Waters who plague the metagame. These characteristics and his ability to provide Leech Seed and Toxic support make Snover an important aspect on defensive teams despite his poor stat distribution. However, for the most part, Snover will and should only be used in UU play if you want to build a hail team; otherwise, he might as well just be a stationary rock.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Snover is a huge eyebrow raiser in the UU tier when you consider his rock-bottom stats. However, with the removal of Abomasnow from UU, Snover remains the last man standing who can automatically summon a hailstorm. Snover is usually the main centerpiece on hail teams, so placing him in the lead slot is usually ideal in order to get hail on the field as soon as possible. A Leech Seed set would only make sense on someone like Snover, ensuring that he isn't a sitting duck against anything.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leech Seed is Snover’s best bet to stay alive in the match and actually stall something out. Protect allows Snover to stall the opponent with Leech Seed and heal off some HP in the process. In addition to this, Protect also shields him from Ambipom’s Fake Out. Blizzard is Snover’s main attacking move since it gains 100% accuracy under hail. However, Toxic is also a noteworthy option to consider over Blizzard, if you’re planning on stalling. There are a number of things to choose from in the final slot, and they each have their own purposes. Substitute is an excellent way of stalling the opponent out with the combination of Leech Seed and Protect. Wood Hammer hits hard on Pokemon who are a little frail on the physical side like Alakazam, Mismagius, and Lanturn. Ice Shard scares away Swellow, although Snover would need to run an Adamant nature to inflict any sort of respectable damage. GrassWhistle was not listed in the main set, but it could be used to provide sleep support even with the terrible accuracy.<p>

<p>There are many ways to distribute EVs on Snover. The standard EV spread provided allows Snover to combat several specially inclined threats, mostly bulky Waters. The provided HP EVs ensure Snover takes one less damage from Stealth Rock, while still maintaining maximum recovery from Leftovers. The given Speed EVs ensure Snover outpaces base 50 Speed Pokemon. You can tweak the EV spread a little bit to make Snover a little more threatening offensively. For a physical-based EV spread, an Adamant nature with the EVs 248 HP / 172 Atk / 88 Spe could work in order to dish out decent damage with Wood Hammer and Ice Shard. For a specially-based EV spread, 248 HP / 172 SpA / 88 Spe could work to increase the damage of Blizzard.</p>

<p>There are a number of Pokemon who benefit from Snover’s hail. Examples include Walrein, Jynx, and Glaceon. If you’re looking to run a stall team with Snover, Walrein makes an ideal partner. Thanks to his ability, Ice Body, Walrein is quite adept at stalling with Substitute and Protect when used under hail. If your stall team needs a Spikes user, Substitute Froslass does the job extremely well thanks to its ability, Snow Cloak. For more offensive hail teams, Glaceon can spam 100% Blizzards, and Froslass can also run an offensive Substitute set.</p>

<p>If you want to improve the stall team as a whole, bringing a defensive Altaria can be quite beneficial for Snover and hail teams in general. Altaria brings convenient resistances to Fighting- and Fire-type moves, and he can provide the entire team with Heal Bell support. Nidoqueen also fits the bill since she can check a number of Fighting-type threats who threaten Snover and can provide Stealth Rock support as well. Offensively, Hariyama works well with Snover, providing a convenient resistance to Fire-type moves thanks to Thick Fat. Arcanine and Houndoom’s ability Flash Fire allows them to absorb Fire-type hits directed at Snover.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Hidden Power Ground
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Energy Ball / Wood Hammer
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Hasty
evs: 8 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 244 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When Snover enters the playing field, the one thing going through the opponent's mind will be "dead weight". It is used almost solely in UU to set up hail, then either sit around for the majority of the match or just be used as death fodder. However, when equipped with a Choice Scarf, Snover stops being dead weight for hail teams and instead becomes an effective counter to almost every Rain Dance team, as well as an effective revenge killer to common Pokemon such as Venusaur.</p>

<p>Blizzard is the primary attack, as it has 180 Base Power after STAB combined with 100% accuracy and no drawbacks in hail. Although Blizzard is the most powerful attack on the set, it is not the only useful one; Hidden Power Ground allows Snover to significantly damage Aggron and provides excellent coverage with Blizzard. Ice Shard is a useful tool for killing faster Pokemon with a bit of health left, such as Swellow or Dugtrio. In the final moveslot, use your Grass-type move of choice; regardless of what move you choose, Snover will still be able to demolish Rain Dance, giving it a unique niche in the UU metagame.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>244 Speed EVs with a Hasty Nature allows Snover to outspeed max Speed base 80 Pokemon such as Venusaur or Kabutops, as well as Life Orb Milotic and max Speed, neutral natured base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Arcanine. Venusaur, who will usually stay in and try to KO Snover with Life Orb Sludge Bomb, can be taken out by Blizzard before it even gets a chance to land a hit on Snover. The key to stopping rain is the element of surprise that this set gives. All Snover has to do is switch into Kabutops, either during Swords Dance or after Kabutops has killed one of your Pokemon. With the rain stopped due to Snow Warning, Snover will now outspeed Kabutops. Kabutops, under the assumption that it will be faster, will try to OHKO Snover with Stone Edge, but it will promptly be OHKOed by Snover's Grass-type attack of choice. This same method can take out Omastar (although Omastar will likely switch out unless it can KO Snover) and also stop rain, allowing Snover to slowly wear down all of the opponent's rain sweepers.</p>

<p>Choosing between Energy Ball and Wood Hammer can be difficult. Both can OHKO Kabutops and Omastar; however, the former will have more power versus Rhyperior and Regirock, while the latter will deal more damage to Lanturn and Mismagius. This can be especially useful when these Pokemon switch in, expecting a light Grass Knot and instead getting smashed by a STAB Wood Hammer.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Snover adds yet another sweeper onto "Blizzspam" teams, and also adds a safety net for hail stall teams that often find themselves weak to Rain Dance. Obviously, other Pokemon that can abuse hail are excellent partners. Glaceon, Walrein, and Jynx can fire off STAB Blizzards from their high Special Attack stats. Dugtrio is another useful Pokemon on these hail teams, trapping and KOing Registeel and Chansey, two of Snover's biggest threats. To keep Snover healthy, a Rapid Spin user is also advised, as Snover has enough trouble switching into attacks with its low defenses anyway. Snover should be used on teams that are in need of hail, such as offensive Blizzard or hail stall teams. Snover's Snow Warning will cut Synthesis and Morning Sun's healing power, as well as take off 6% HP from your Pokemon each turn, unless they are Ice-types.</p>

<p>Registeel is the best counter to this set, shrugging off anything Snover throws at it and firing off Thunder Waves, Iron Heads, or setting up Rain Dance for free. Arcanine can also shrug off all of Snover's attacks and OHKO with Flare Blitz, and can outspeed Snover without the use of boosting items (assuming it has a positive nature). Moltres also outspeeds with a positive nature and can switch in on every attack except Blizzard, threatening Snover with STAB Fire Blast. Snover's utility dramatically goes down after the set is revealed, as it only takes smart switching to ultimately take it down.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Supportwise, Snover gets a lot of things to play around with. As mentioned in the set, GrassWhistle could be used in the final slot to provide sleep support, although the accuracy is very low, making the effectiveness of the move near-useless. Snover also gets Light Screen if you want to halve the damage of special attacks for a couple of turns. Lastly, Magic Coat could work if you want to reflect Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Uxie or Mesprit.</p>

<p>Offensively, Snover gets Swords Dance, and if he happens to slip in a single boost, he can actually hurt a couple of things. Snover can use Wood Hammer, Ice Shard, and Ice Punch as the main offensive moves in conjunction with Swords Dance. Snover can run a mixed set as well, although it doesn’t have the overall stats to effectively run it.

<p>An alternate EV spread Snover could run is 248 HP / 172 Atk / 88 Spe with an Adamant nature. This particular spread aims to inflict damage on the opponent. You can replace Blizzard with Wood Hammer on the third slot if you want to attack with physical moves. With the EV spread, Swellow is 2HKOd from Ice Shard, with a chance to OHKO if it came in on Stealth Rock and if it has taken both Toxic and Hail damage. You can also aim for a similar EV spread as the previous one, but instead focus on utilizing special attacks. A Modest nature with 248 HP / 172 SpA / 88 Spe should suffice.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Counters? You could pull an entire list when you take into account his typing and overall stats; anything with a Fire-, Steel-, or Fighting-type move are considered counters. For Fire-types, Arcanine, Blaziken, Houndoom, and Moltres can easily torch Snover, while they take pitiful damage from Snover's attacks. For Steel-types, Registeel can literally switch in with impunity and take down Snover with Iron Head, or grab a free turn to set up Stealth Rock. As for Fighting-types, not everyone can switch in successfully on Snover, but Hariyama is the best Fighting-type switch in due to its ability, Thick Fat. Hariyama can shatter Snover into a million pieces with Close Combat. Other Fighting-types include Hitmontop and Hitmonlee – both can come in on Blizzard thanks to their respectable Special Defense stats and scare away Snover with Close Combat. Clefable's ability allows it to walk all over Toxic, Leech Seed, and hail damage quite easily, making it a foolproof counter.</p>
