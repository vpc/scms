[Overview]

<p>Castform is a cute Pokemon with a unique ability; unfortunately, that is the extent of his advantageous traits.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Thunderbolt 
move 3: Flamethrower / Fire Blast
move 4: Energy Ball / Shadow Ball
item: Life Orb / Expert Belt
nature: Modest 
evs: 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Castform's best chance at being competitively viable. BoltBeam forms Castform's attacking core, with a Fire-type move rounding off the coverage perfectly. Energy Ball is mostly filler, but is useful against Water / Ground-types, who are neutral to BoltBeam. Same goes for Shadow Ball, but for Ghost- and Psychic-types. With these four moves, Castform hits quite a bit of the tier super effectively, which is good since he lacks a reliable STAB attack, so anything he can't hit super effectively can quite easily shrug off any of his attempts.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A boosting item is pretty much necessary if Castform wants to be offensively capable at all; Life Orb provides the highest boost possible (while still maintaining the ability to switch moves), but since Castform hits so many Pokemon super effectively, Expert Belt is also a viable option, with a similar boost and no recoil. The EVs are an attempt to bolster Castform's lackluster stats for sweeping, putting Castform a point above Jolly Torterra. A Timid nature and 244 Speed EVs can be used if you want Castform to outpace neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon. The remaining EVs can then be added to HP for bulk.</p>

<p>Castform is a slow, relatively weak special attacker; therefore, we can say that he'll appreciate entry hazard, dual screen, paralysis, and wallbreaker support. Uxie can do the former three well, and also makes a great fallback Pokemon when facing powerful attackers. Blaziken is pretty much undisputed as the best wallbreaker in the tier, although Nidoking can give him a run for his money. Castform really shouldn't be used in any competitive team, so it's recommended that you just replace him with one of the many other, better special attackers in the tier if you're at least a little bit serious about winning, and go with their team options.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Choice Specs set can be used to make up for Castform's bad Special Attack stat, but even then he lacks the power, and without the ability to switch moves, he becomes even easier to wall. A physical set is a bad idea since the only viable physical attacks Castform learns are Return, Facade, and Avalanche. Thunder Wave and Toxic can cripple switch-ins, but running either will cut coverage. Weather Ball can be a great 100 Base Power STAB move if Castform is being used on a weather team, and if Sunny Day is the weather of choice, then SolarBeam becomes viable too.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If it's not hit super effectively, it counters Castform. In UU, this includes (but is most definitely not limited to): Absol, Aggron, Ambipom, Arcanine, Blaziken, Chansey, Clefable, Drapion, Hariyama, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, Houndoom, Kangaskhan, Ludicolo, Mesprit, Miltank, Primeape, Spiritomb, Ursaring, Uxie, and Weezing. Heck, even some Pokemon that are hit super effectively can counter Castform if they're bulky enough, like Milotic, Lanturn, Mismagius, and Registeel, among others.</p>
