[Overview]

<p>At first sight, Alakazam and Uxie both seem to outclass Gardevoir, but she can distinguish herself by being offensive and defensive at the same time. Gardevoir's support movepool includes Will-O-Wisp, Wish, Taunt, and Encore, and allows her to disrupt the enemy's team while aiding her own side. Offensively, Gardevoir has base 125 Special Attack, along with Psychic, Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, and Thunderbolt to deal massive damage to incoming foes. She also comes with the rare Trace ability, allowing her to copy an opponent's ability and turn the tables on them.</p>

<p>Gardevoir has a few problems to address, however. Due to Gardevoir being a balance of offense and defense, if you're looking for a Pokemon who specializes towards one specific role, Alakazam or Uxie may be more suitable. As with Alakazam, Gardevoir has low Defense and HP stats, meaning that she is vulnerable to Pursuit-wielding physical attackers. Gardevoir's 80 base Speed is also rather average, allowing many other Pokemon to outspeed her. Nevertheless, Gardevoir's Trace ability, great movepool, and spectacular special stats all are advantages that make her unique.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to support the team by burning and cutting the opponent's Attack stat in half while providing overall healing with the help of Gardevoir's immense special bulk.</p>

<p>Will-O-Wisp allows Gardevoir to cripple enemy physical attackers, such as Absol, Drapion, and Spiritomb, with a damaging burn. To restore Gardevoir's health, she can use Wish and Protect; the combination essentially gives Gardevoir a 50% recovery move. Protect also helps Gardevoir stall while the opponent is continuously hurt by burn. If a cleric is needed, Gardevoir can perform that role as well thanks to Heal Bell, but note that Wish will become much more difficult to use since you no longer have room for Protect. Therefore, when using Heal Bell, choosing Pain Split as the health recovery move is recommended. Last but not least, Psychic is Gardevoir's STAB option to deal damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If Pain Split is being used, note that it can perform either better or worse than Wish and Protect depending on the circumstances. Against Clefable, Wish and Protect would be the superior option (note that Pain Split can still heal from Clefable even though she won't take any damage from it). However, if Pain Split is used on Chansey, expect a massive amount of health stolen due to her base 250 HP. In other cases, the opponent could switch in a low HP Pokemon on a Pain Split, essentially making Gardevoir waste a turn hurting herself.</p>

<p>Although not mentioned, Thunderbolt can be used in the fourth slot if Protect or Heal Bell aren't necessary. Thunderbolt allows Gardevoir to attack Pokemon who take little or no damage from Psychic, such as Drapion, Houndoom, and Mesprit. Gardevoir can also utilize Taunt, which can stop slower walls from using support moves. Lastly, Hypnosis and Thunder Wave are usable for double status. Hypnosis can effectively remove a Pokemon from play. Thunder Wave can slow down deadly Pokemon such as Arcanine and Houndoom, allowing your teammates to outrun and KO them.</p>

<p>The EVs allow Gardevoir to be as specially bulky as possible. 252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs allow Gardevoir to survive dangerous attacks such as Life Orb Dark Pulse from +2 Modest Toxicroak, Choice Specs Shadow Ball from Timid Rotom, and Life Orb Surf in the rain from Omastar. Gardevoir can also use a more physically bulky spread with 252 HP / 124 Def / 132 SpD. With this spread, Gardevoir takes 42.4% - 50% from Jolly Life Orb Hitmonlee's Close Combat. In return, Gardevoir has a high chance to OHKO Hitmonlee even without Close Combat's defenses drops with Psychic despite no Special Attack investment.</p>

<p>Gardevoir will usually run into trouble against Flash Fire Pokemon—namely Houndoom and Arcanine—who can absorb her Will-O-Wisp. Teammates who can deal with these Pokemon are extremely beneficial to Gardevoir. Against these Fire-types, Water-type Pokemon such as Blastoise and Milotic can switch in and destroy them with Surf. Pokemon with Calm Mind and Taunt or Substitute, such as Mismagius and Alakazam, are equally threatening. Encore can be used over Heal Bell to remedy this weakness if the foe isn't using Taunt, but note that Will-O-Wisp is illegal with Encore, so Thunder Wave or Hypnosis will have to replace Will-O-Wisp. Alternatively, Registeel deals with Mismagius, Alakazam, and even certain physical priority users such as Ambipom and Scyther, but be wary that Registeel may take a good chunk of damage in return, especially if you mispredict and switch into the wrong attack.</p>

<p>Strong physical attackers who outspeed Gardevoir and have not been burned by Will-O-Wisp will be a problem, especially Pursuit users. Venusaur, Scyther, and Absol all fall in this problematic category. Therefore, a strong physical tank or wall, such as Registeel, Rotom, or Weezing, will make a good partner for Gardevoir. Registeel can Thunder Wave these threats, while the other two can burn them if Gardevoir fails to do so on the switch.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice

move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Trick / Shadow Ball
item: Choice Specs / Choice Scarf
ability: Trace
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice item, Gardevoir becomes either an efficient revenge killer or an extreme damage dealer. A great offensive movepool, access to Trick, and acceptably distributed base stats allow Gardevoir to become a dangerous threat.</p>

<p>Psychic, combined with Thunderbolt, gives Gardevoir the ability to hit every Pokemon in UU for neutral damage, except for Steelix, Magneton, Shedinja, and Exeggutor. Steel-types including Steelix, Magneton, or Registeel are hammered by Focus Blast. To top the set off, Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple an incoming wall, such as Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel, with an unwanted item. To deal with Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as the aforementioned Shedinja and Exeggutor, Shadow Ball is a great alternative move over Trick.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs listed apply only if Gardevoir is using a Timid nature. 252 Speed EVs allow Gardevoir to reach 426 Speed with a Choice Scarf, outrunning everything up to and including Electrode and Modest Choice Scarf Rotom. If Modest is the chosen nature, 16 Def / 252 SpA / 240 Spe should be used. 240 Speed EVs reach 384 Speed, outrunning max Speed positive nature base 125 Pokemon, namely Swellow. As for the item, Choice Scarf is the main option as it gives Gardevoir's base 80 Speed a grand boost, allowing her to outrun and deal good damage to most threats. On the other hand, Choice Specs does nothing for Gardevoir's Speed, but it does provide an incredible power boost behind every attack; for instance, Gardevoir has a chance to 2HKO standard Registeel and OHKO 252 / 252 Calm Clefable with Focus Blast.</p>

<p>Choice Gardevoir has a rough time with Pursuit users, especially those who resist or are immune to Psychic. Drapion, Absol, and Spiritomb are all massive threats for this reason. Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done, especially if Gardevoir finishes off a Pokemon and a Pursuit user switches in for the revenge kill. Caution is therefore required if you want to have Gardevoir stick around to KO important Pokemon. Double switching Gardevoir out to a Pokemon who can take on the aforementioned Dark-types, such as Donphan and Venusaur, may seem like a lousy waste of a turn, but this effectively scouts what Pursuit user the foe may have.</p>

<p>Even with Trick, Gardevoir will still have problems with special walls, primarily Chansey. Dugtrio will solve any Chansey problems with his Arena Trap ability and Earthquake unless Chansey holds Shed Shell. If Dugtrio isn't suitable, Pursuit users on Gardevoir’s side will work as well. Drapion, Absol, and Spiritomb, despite being vulnerable to status from Chansey, are some STAB Pursuit users who can trap and kill her. Defensive Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hariyama will also help out against Chansey, although rare is the scenario where an opponent will leave Chansey in against these Fighting-types. Hitmontop also comes with a Technician-boosted Pursuit.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Shadow Ball / Thunderbolt
move 4: Psychic / Taunt
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
ability: Trace
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gardevoir with Calm Mind can sweep whole teams given the right scenario. With the moves to provide neutral coverage as well as stopping walls or tanks from being annoying, Gardevoir can prove to be a stable Calm Mind sweeper.</p>

<p>Calm Mind is the purpose of this set, allowing Gardevoir to increase her special stats to astounding levels. Focus Blast and Shadow Ball together hit every Pokemon for neutral damage, and crucially both can hit Pokemon whom Gardevoir cannot harm with her STAB Psychic for super effective damage, such as Registeel, Uxie, and Absol. Thunderbolt is a great alternative move over Shadow Ball to provide more damage against a different group of Pokemon, such as Milotic, Moltres, and Drifblim. Psychic is Gardevoir's best STAB attack to use, but its coverage may be redundant. As such, Taunt is a great replacement over Psychic to prevent status from incoming walls while also stopping them from restoring their health.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If Gardevoir has Taunt in place of Psychic, note that there will be cases where Psychic's reliable STAB will be missed. For example, a Clefable with around 30% HP can die from Gardevoir's Focus Blast, but in this case Psychic would be the better option due to its 100% accuracy as opposed to Focus Blast's 70%. Against Pokemon who take neutral damage from both Shadow Ball and Focus Blast, such as Arcanine and Lanturn, Psychic does more damage.</p>

<p>Although better suited for defensive sets, Will-O-Wisp in the fourth slot can help Gardevoir cripple physical threats, which enables Gardevoir to set up more Calm Minds. This gives Gardevoir two roles in one: a supporter and a sweeper.</p>

<p>Maxing Gardevoir's Speed stat gives 284 Speed, Speed-tying with Pokemon such as Venusaur, Kabutops, and Blaziken. All three of these Pokemon can be slaughtered by Psychic (or Thunderbolt in Kabutops's case). As for the item, Life Orb allows Gardevoir to dish out more damage at the cost of being more fragile. However, if that's not favorable, Leftovers can be used to give Gardevoir more survivability.</p>

<p>Because Gardevoir has only base 80 Speed and base 65 Defense, faster physical attackers such as Dugtrio, Drapion, and Scyther can switch in on a Calm Mind and threaten with their most damaging move or Pursuit (or plainly trap Gardevoir in Dugtrio's case). Scouting for these Pokemon beforehand and burning or paralyzing them with Pokemon such as Rotom, Registeel, and Clefable would help Gardevoir destroy these Pokemon when they switch back in.</p>

<p>Encore users and dedicated special walls, such as Clefable, Chansey, and Spiritomb, also pose problems for this set if it lacks Taunt, as they can lock Gardevoir into one move, which Calm Mind Gardevoir does not like, or just plainly wall and wear down Gardevoir. Physically-minded Pokemon such as Guts Hariyama, Aggron, and Arcanine can help Gardevoir out against these threats. Guts Hariyama can pummel the two Normal-types while absorbing status from all three. Stone Edge or Payback from Hariyama will also eventually destroy Spiritomb who lack Rest. Aggron must watch out for status from the three Pokemon, but if he can get in on an attack, he will deal devastating damage against them with his Head Smash. Non-RestTalk Arcanine plays much more conservatively with Morning Sun and Flash Fire, but watch out for incoming Thunder Wave when using him. Arcanine with Intimidate also helps out against physical Spiritomb.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Memento
move 4: Taunt / Will-O-Wisp / Psychic
item: Light Clay
ability: Trace
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The goal of this set is to reliably set up dual screens and then use Memento, giving a sweeper an essential free switch-in. With her sacrifice, Gardevoir ensures that your incoming sweeper has a higher chance of sweeping the opponent's team.</p>

<p>With the help of Light Clay increasing the duration of dual screens, Reflect and Light Screen become very potent for handling packs of vicious attackers. Reflect should be used first to patch up Gardevoir's weaker Defense stat, followed by Light Screen as a matter of course. Once both screens have been set up, Memento should be used to faint Gardevoir while crippling both of the opponent's offensive stats. This allows a sweeper to switch in without fear of being damaged greatly while also forcing the opponent to switch out. To help Gardevoir set up the screens and support the sweepers, Taunt can be used to safeguard against annoying status moves, especially sleep, and support moves, such as Stealth Rock, Wish, and Toxic Spikes. Will-O-Wisp is a great alternative to cripple physical attackers; when combined with with Reflect, physical attackers will no longer be a problem. Lastly, Psychic allows Gardevoir to avoid being setup bait when Taunted.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Healing Wish can be used over Memento if the protection provided by dual screens is generally enough. This allows a sweeper from early-game to be usable again in late-game. However, if Gardevoir did not take the attack beforehand, make sure that when switching in the sweeper won't be KOed by the incoming attack while switching in.</p>

<p>This particular Gardevoir specifically wants dedicated setup sweepers who can make use of the dual screens and Memento. Sweepers who are resistant or take little damage from Gardevoir's weaknesses should be considered; examples include Swords Dance Drapion, Rock Polish Aggron, Dragon Dance Altaria, and Swords Dance or Agility Blaziken.</p>

<p>Fast Taunt and Encore users can be annoying to this Gardevoir as they can stop her from doing her job or lock her into a useless move. Ambipom, Mismagius, and Alakazam are able to do this, but at the same time are very fragile as well. Choice Band Spiritomb can easily switch into any of these Pokemon and remove them with Pursuit. Toxic Orb Swellow, on the Taunt or Encore, can outspeed and OHKO all three of these Pokemon with Brave Bird or Facade, but needs to be sure he is not switching into an attack. Swellow can also utilize Pursuit to trap the aforementioned threats.</p>

[SET]
name: Weather Counter

evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Gardevoir set is a little more specialized, and therefore more situational, than her other sets, but it still functions well in the UU metagame. The basic premise of the set is to use Gardevoir as an all-out attacker, who, at the same time, can act as one of the best Rain Dance checks in the UU tier. When countering rain teams, the idea is to switch Gardevoir into one of the opponent's Swift Swim Pokemon and copy its ability with Trace. After Gardevoir has Traced Swift Swim, she becomes faster than every other Swift Swim abuser (with the exceptions of Floatzel and Qwilfish). From there, Gardevoir can use the rain to her advantage and turn the tables on the opponent, forcing them to go on the defensive. The great thing about Gardevoir as a rain check is that she can continue to sweep outside of the rain, thanks to her good Speed and tremendous Special Attack stats.</p>

<p>Psychic is the STAB move of choice and is a strong, reliable move that allows Gardevoir to destroy Venusaur and the multitude of Fighting-types in the tier. The other moves give Gardevoir excellent coverage, as well as the best possible combination of moves to counter-sweep a rain team. Thunderbolt combines with Psychic for near perfect neutral coverage in UU, as it smacks Milotic, Moltres, and Slowbro for super effective damage; it also OHKOes every Swift Swim sweeper outside of Ludicolo. Shadow Ball can be run over Thunderbolt to nail Ghost-types, especially Rotom and Mismagius, and Psychic-types for super effective damage. As Gardevoir is an attacker first and a rain check second, being walled too easily by common walls such as Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable is a problem. Focus Blast solves this problem by 2HKOing Registeel and dealing 74.6% - 88.3% to the standard Clefable, which is a KO if Clefable first switches in on Psychic. Unfortunately, Gardevoir remains utterly walled by Chansey. If you find Focus Blast's accuracy to be a huge turn off, Signal Beam is a good substitute, allowing Gardevoir to hit Ludicolo, the most popular rain sweeper in UU; fellow Psychic-types, such as Uxie, Mesprit, and Slowking; and pure Grass-types, including Tangrowth and Leafeon, for super effective damage; coincidentally, the aforementioned Psychic-types are also common rain starters. Keep in mind that Shadow Ball and Signal Beam should never be used in conjunction, as they have a lot of overlapping coverage, and Gardevoir will be left out in the cold versus a whole myriad of Pokemon. The last slot is left for Will-O-Wisp, which is Gardevoir's best auxiliary move inside and outside rain, allowing her to cripple potential Dark-type counters such as Spiritomb, Absol, Drapion, and Skuntank.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Expert Belt can be run over Life Orb thanks to Gardevoir's excellent super effective coverage, and it also gives her a little more survivability. However, the slight loss in power is a turn-off, as Expert Belt makes it so that Gardevoir is required to run Thunderbolt to OHKO the aforementioned rain sweepers. Energy Ball is a nice replacement for Thunderbolt and gets all the same OHKOs on the rain sweepers while also having the added benefit of hitting Rhyperior, Donphan, and Lanturn for super effective damage. If you are hell-bent on stopping rain at all costs, Taunt can be used to ensure that Rain Dance cannot be used in front of Gardevoir. Outside of rain, Taunt lets Gardevoir shut down Chansey, Registeel, and Clefable without the need for Focus Blast. Finally, Reflect or Light Screen can be used to provide a buffer against incoming revenge killers such as Dark-type Pursuit users, as well as to support the rest of Gardevoir's team.</p>

<p>If rain is not a factor in the battle, Gardevoir works well as an all-out attacker. Just bring in Gardevoir on a weak special attack, such as Milotic's Surf, and let loose with any attack your heart desires. Gardevoir's ability also comes into play here, as she is able to Trace Lanturn's Volt Absorb as she switches in and be healed from Lanturn's Thunderbolt. She can do the same to Water Absorb users such as Quagsire and Poliwrath and Flash Fire users like Arcanine and Houndoom (extreme caution should be taken around the latter, however). The trickiness comes into play when using Gardevoir as a rain check, as her low physical defense makes it hard for her to switch into the above Swift Swim sweepers safely. She is OHKOed by most of their attacks under the rain, so in most cases, she will have to be brought in after a teammate has been KOed. Another strategy is to employ a double-switch with a teammate such as Registeel, who walls a majority of rain sweepers. U-turn from a partner such as Uxie will also give her the opportunity to come in safely. Coincidentally, Gardevoir also makes a good Sunny Day check. With Signal Beam and Psychic, she has no problem OHKOing a majority of the normal Chlorophyll sweepers, such as Shiftry, Exeggutor, Victreebel, and Vileplume, and gets a near OHKO on Tangrowth.</p>

<p>Donphan and Cloyster make good teammates; they can Rapid Spin, wall physical attacks aimed at Gardevoir, and set up their own entry hazards. Lead Cloyster can also prevent Uxie from getting up Stealth Rock while also setting up its own hazards. Priority users can clean up any KOs Gardevoir may have missed; Ambipom, Hariyama, and Hitmontop all make excellent teammates, as do the aforementioned Donphan and Cloyster. Fire-types can make the most of a lack of Rain Dance, especially Arcanine, Houndoom, and Blaziken. Pursuit trappers can trap and KO Gardevoir, so pairing Gardevoir with a Fighting-type such as Toxicroak, Hitmonlee, or the aforementioned Hariyama and Hitmontop ensures that your team can easily avenge her should she be KOed while trying to escape. As Gardevoir still has problems with Ghost-types even when using Shadow Ball, pairing her with a Pursuit user of your own can prove highly beneficial and can allow her to continue a clean sweep of the opponent's team.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Gardevoir has an incredible movepool, making gimmicky and unusual sets possible. Signal Beam is a great move for offensive sets, striking Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Trick Room can support Pokemon with low Speed; a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs coupled with her average base 80 Speed make Gardevoir quite a comfortable Trick Room user. Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Hypnosis are usable to inflict even more status upon Gardevoir's enemies. Encore is mentioned throughout the analysis because it's a wonderful move in general, but Gardevoir is strapped for moveslots; it is also illegal with Will-O-Wisp. Torment is an interesting move but Gardevoir can't use it well because she lacks resistances. Grass Knot and Energy Ball are available if Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon are troubling you. As a last resort, Destiny Bond can take a troublesome enemy down, but Gardevoir's base 80 Speed makes the idea mildly lackluster. Confuse Ray with Thunder Wave can be annoying to your enemy. Substitute and Pain Split can be utilized together, but Rotom generally does this better with lower HP, higher Speed, and three immunities.</p>

<p>A "stallbreaker" set with Taunt / Will-O-Wisp / Pain Split / Encore and 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe as well as a Timid nature can be used. Some of the usual counters to Gardevoir such as Spiritomb and Chansey will regret approaching Gardevoir as they can't do much against this set. But because this set does not have an attacking move, it can be easily countered by any opposing Fire-type Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Pokemon who generally strikes hard on the physical side will usually bring down Gardevoir; however, these Pokemon should beware of Will-O-Wisp. Houndoom, although weak to Focus Blast, makes a great counter to any Gardevoir set due to his Flash Fire ability, which absorbs Will-O-Wisp for enhanced Fire-type damage, and Pursuit, which will destroy Gardevoir if she switches. Other Dark-type Pursuit users, such as Drapion, Absol, Skuntank, and Spiritomb, will usually end Gardevoir's life immediately if they avoid switching into Will-O-Wisp (or Focus Blast, in Absol's case).</p>

<p>On the defensive side, Chansey, and to a lesser extent Clefable, both wall Gardevoir comfortably, although Clefable is vulnerable to Focus Blast at times. Clefable can come in and Encore any support move that Gardevoir uses. Gardevoir will only end up hindering herself if she tries Tricking Clefable, as the Choice item will usually be swapped for a Toxic Orb in the exchange. Chansey can come in on any move except Trick and wall Gardevoir with her massive HP and Special Defense while draining Gardevoir’s HP with Seismic Toss; however, Chansey should watch out for Pain Split stealing her massive HP. Clefable also doesn't mind Will-O-Wisp due to Magic Guard while Chansey has Natural Cure to heal the burn off on the switch. Both must watch out for Taunt though, which can turn both into setup bait for Gardevoir.</p>

<p>In addition to the specially defensive Normal-types, Steel-types who can survive a Focus Blast will be a nuisance to Gardevoir. Registeel can switch into a Psychic or Shadow Ball, cripple Gardevoir with Thunder Wave, and strike her down with repeated Iron Heads, although it must be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Having a user of Aromatherapy or Heal Bell, such as Chansey or Uxie, is a great way to heal your precious check from Gardevoir's status moves.</p>
