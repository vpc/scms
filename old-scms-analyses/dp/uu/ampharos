[Overview]

<p>Ampharos isn't your average Electric-type, as it is neither fast nor frail. Due to its good defenses, access to helpful support moves such as Reflect and Heal Bell, and single weakness, Ampharos makes a great supporting tank. Don't think Ampharos is weak offensively, either; it has access to a strong STAB Thunderbolt coming from 361 Special Attack, as well as Focus Punch to deal with pesky walls such as Chansey. Ampharos's ability, Static, is helpful against physical attackers, as Ampharos has a chance to paralyze and cripple any Pokemon who makes contact with it. Ampharos's biggest downfall is its low Speed stat, which makes it vulnerable to faster opponents who carry Ground-type attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Why Ampharos Don't Have Wool (Life Orb)
move 1: Thunderbolt

move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Substitute / Focus Punch
item: Life Orb
nature: Modest / Mild
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ampharos is different than most of his Electric-type brethren due to good defenses and low Speed. He still maintains an excellent base 115 Special Attack stat, and Thunderbolt can obliterate many common Pokemon in UU. This set takes advantage of Ampharos's natural bulk to help set up Substitute on weak walls and begin opening up holes in the opponent's team.</p>

<p>The core move of this set is Thunderbolt. With Stealth Rock on the field, Ampharos will nearly always OHKO Bulky Water Milotic. Thunderbolt also gets rid of powerful threats such as Toxicroak and Alakazam in one strike. Because of Ampharos's natural bulk, most offensive threats will not be able to OHKO him, allowing him to go toe-to-toe with top threats and come out the victor. Ground-types have an unfortunate immunity to Electric attacks, but Hidden Power Ice remedies this. Hidden Power Ice allows Ampharos to hit Ground-types hard, having a great chance to OHKO standard Donphan as he tries to absorb Thunderbolt. Hidden Power Ice also OHKOes Torterra, but Ampharos needs to hit max Speed variants on the switch or when safely behind a Substitute. Focus Blast allows Ampharos to 2HKO both Clefable and Registeel, while giving him a way to threaten Chansey. Focus Blast also allows Ampharos to OHKO standard Rhyperior, as Hidden Power Ice can only muster a 2HKO. Substitute is the primary option in the last slot, as Ampharos can use his bulk and power to cause switches. It also helps ease prediction, and guards Ampharos against opposing Dugtrio. Although a dry Focus Punch may seem sketchy, it's Ampharos's best bet at eliminating Chansey.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ampharos can run Hidden Power Grass to reliably OHKO Rhyperior and Water/Ground-types. This also allows Ampharos to hit Lanturn who would otherwise wall him, but Hidden Power Ice is usually the superior option. If you want a bulkier Ampharos, an alternative EV spread of 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Speed allows Ampharos to take hits considerably better at the cost of Speed. 48 Speed EVs allow Ampharos to outspeed minimum Speed Clefable, standard Rhyperior, and other slow walls. If using the bulkier spread, Leftovers becomes a viable option. When using Focus Punch, a Mild nature is recommended to hit Chansey harder.</p>

<p>Because Ampharos can get rid of bulky Water-types easily, Fire-types are perfect partners. Arcanine is a great choice as he's one of the more durable options. Arcanine can help eliminate pesky Grass-types, such as Venusaur, who plagues Ampharos. Because Ampharos's sole weakness is Ground, a resistance or immunity to Earthquake is extremely useful. Mismagius makes an excellent partner with Ampharos because of his ability to KO Registeel with repeated Focus Blasts. Mixed variants of Sceptile pair well with Ampharos, as they weaken each other's counters. Because of potential paralysis from Static, slow but powerful Pokemon such as Torterra make good teammates. Lanturn can be quite the pest for Ampharos, so pairing him with a Pokemon such as Venusaur is also recommended.</p>

<p>Dugtrio is a major threat to Ampharos, as blindly throwing out Thunderbolt will cause him to be trapped and OHKOed. Ampharos should always try to be safely behind a Substitute. If Ampharos is somehow revenge killed by Dugtrio, having a threatening partner such as Moltres or the previously mentioned Torterra will allow you to gain back some momentum.</p> 

[SET]
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Discharge
move 2: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
move 3: Heal Bell
move 4: Reflect / Light Screen
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 252 HP / 80 SpA / 176 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes full use of Ampharos's potential as a team supporter. 90/75/90 defenses are nothing to scoff at, especially when Ampharos only has one weakness. Discharge's 30% paralysis rate makes it a great option on this set also as it helps compensate for Ampharos's low Speed stat. Hidden Power is mainly used for coverage, hitting the Ground-types who love to switch in on Ampharos for super effective damage. Heal Bell supports Ampharos's teammates by removing status afflictions, while Reflect and Light Screen help weaken the opponent's attacks. Toxic and Thunder Wave may also be used on this set, though they may conflict with Static and Discharge. Hidden Power Ice is preferred for BoltBeam coverage, but Hidden Power Grass is useful as it can hit Lanturn and Rhyperior.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set ensure that Ampharos survives a rain-boosted Surf from Omastar, factoring in Stealth Rock and Leftovers. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to give Ampharos's attacks more power. Alternatively, you may use Ampharos in a more defensive role as a dual screener; if you choose to go this route, a Calm nature can be used along with a spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD and with Light Clay instead of Leftovers. When you Ampharos's Special Attack EVs with Defense EVs, it becomes much more difficult to KO.</p>

<p>Being completely specially-based, this set is walled by the likes of Chansey and Clefable. There are multiple ways to deal with this, the first being a physical attacker such as Hitmontop or Dugtrio. Dugtrio has the added bonus of being able trap the opposing Pokemon with its ability, Arena Trap. Another option is using Mismagius with Taunt and Nasty Plot, which allows it to boost its Special Attack while muscling through the aforementioned walls with boosted Hidden Power Fighting. Taunt ensures that the opposing Pokemon cannot cripple Mismagius with status moves. Mismagius also makes for a good partner to Ampharos because it can avoid damage from any Brick Break users attempting to break the screens that Ampharos sets up, even if the screens still get broken; it also has an immunity to Earthquake, making it a decent defensive partner.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Signal Beam
item: Choice Specs
nature: Modest
evs: 208 HP / 252 SpA / 48 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike the defensive set, this variant of Ampharos takes advantage of Ampharos's huge Special Attack stat and access to STAB Thunderbolt, which enable it to destroy common UU threats such as Moltres, Milotic, and Slowbro. Focus Blast deals huge chunks of damage to Normal- and Steel-types such as Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel, while Hidden Power is used to hit Ground-types who are immune to Thunderbolt. The choice between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass depends on whom you want Ampharos to cover. Hidden Power Grass hits Omastar, Rhyperior, Quagsire, and Lanturn, while Hidden Power Ice hits Altaria, Donphan, and Venusaur. Hidden Power Ice is usually the superior option, as it deals with more common UU threats such as Venusaur and Altaria. Signal Beam is mainly a filler, though it does hit Shiftry and Exeggutor harder than any other move in Ampharos's arsenal.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>48 Speed EVs are used to outrun 4 Speed Clefable, allowing Ampharos to 2HKO it with Thunderbolt on the switchin before it can move . Max Special Attack paired with Choice Specs gives Ampharos the ability to 2HKO most of UU and seriously dent the rest. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to give Ampharos more overall bulk, which complements its good defenses. If you aren't worried about Clefable, you pour the Speed EVs into HP instead.</p>

<p>Due to Ampharos's low Speed stat, any opponent faster than it becomes an instant threat—especially those with Earthquake. It is recommended that you pair Ampharos with a Pokemon who resists or has an immunity to Ground-type attacks. Mismagius is an obvious first choice due to its Levitate ability and good Speed; however, less-used Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Tangrowth are good options too. Ludicolo and Tangrowth also have access to Leech Seed, which is helpful for recovering Ampharos's
health and works very well with its decent defenses.</p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance Support
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Thunder
move 3: Hidden Power Water
move 4: Safeguard / Reflect / Light Screen
item: Damp Rock / Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 252 HP / 76 SpA / 180 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ampharos makes an ideal Rain Dance setter, as it has great defensive stats and access to 100% accurate STAB Thunder in the rain. Hidden Power Water rounds off the set's coverage, hitting Ground-types super effectively and getting a nice boost from rain. The last slot helps complement Ampharos's defensive ability, providing support for its teammates through Safeguard and screens. Heal Bell may be used too, removing status from the team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set could also use a spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD, making it bulky and difficult to take down. The spread ensures that Omastar won't KO Ampharos with a rain-boosted Surf, even if Stealth Rock is in play. Ampharos may be played more offensively, with a spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD, which allows Ampharos to become a sweeper if necessary. If you choose to go this route, you may swap Ampharos's last move for Focus Blast to hit the likes of Registeel and Chansey super effectively.</p>

<p>As the main focus of this set is Rain Dance, Pokemon who can take advantage of the weather are ideal partners for Ampharos. Swift Swimmers are good options, as they can sweep the opponent quickly; such Pokemon include Ludicolo, who has a great special movepool and STAB Surf and Grass Knot, and Kabutops, who, amongst its credentials, has access to Waterfall, Swords Dance, and Stone Edge. Electric-types can also take advantage of the rain, as they can enjoy abusing 100% accurate STAB Thunder. Rotom is an excellent choice, since it can switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Ampharos and set up screens to support the team if Ampharos is unable to. Rotom also has access to STAB Thunder and Shadow Ball, along with utility moves such as Trick, Will-O-Wisp, and Discharge. Lanturn is an odd Pokemon to pair with Ampharos, as it shares Ampharos's weakness to Ground-type attacks; however, Lanturn can set up rain as well, while taking advantage of boosted STAB Surf and Thunder in the rain. Lanturn can also switch into Electric-type attacks aimed at your sweepers thanks to Volt Absorb.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ampharos can use Counter along with a more defensive EV spread, though its weakness to a very common physical move, Earthquake, will make it pretty useless, as Ampharos is an open invitation for Ground-types to come in. Body Slam is another option that can be used alongside Discharge as a paralysis-inducing auxiliary move that hits Ground-types. Magnet Rise is usable to temporarily remove Ampharos's weakness to Earthquake. Finally, Power Gem is an option on Choice sets to hit Scyther and Moltres 4x super effectively, though STAB Thunderbolt is usually more reliable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chansey is by far the biggest counter to special sets; with her massive HP and good Special Defense, she can wall Ampharos for years with a combination of Softboiled and Seismic Toss. She should watch out for the occasional Focus Punch, though. Lanturn causes problems for most Ampharos sets, thanks to its Volt Absorb ability, which renders Ampharos's STAB Thunderbolt useless, and huge HP and good Special Defense. However, Lanturn can be beaten by Hidden Power Grass or Focus Punch.</p>

<p>Ground-types such as Torterra can tackle most of Ampharos's sets lacking Hidden Power Ice, thanks to its immunity to Electric-type moves and access to Rock Polish to boost its Speed. Torterra will usually force a switch, giving it time to set up and cause problems for the rest of your team. Dugtrio is another great choice for this role, as it can switch into Ampharos's Thunderbolt, trap it with Arena Trap, and proceed to annihilate it with Earthquake.</p>

<p>In general, the best way to deal with Ampharos is to find out what Hidden Power it has and then to play accordingly.</p>
