[Overview]

<p>Wormadam-G is often considered a joke, and one does not have to think hard to discover why. It has a mediocre Attack stat, an odd typing, and a horrible movepool that somehow lacks Stealth Rock despite its Ground typing. With Earthquake and Bug Bite as its only worthwhile attacking options, it would seem that Wormadam-G has no hope of ever making any sort of contribution to competitive battling. However, even this bug has a couple of surprises. Its Defense stat is just good enough to tank various physical hits and its rare typing gives it resistances to both Fighting and Ground—two very common attacking types in the UU metagame. It also has access to Rain Dance, which allows it to be a decent Rain Dance supporter, especially considering that its typing has good synergy with common rain sweepers. Despite its disadvantages, Wormadam-G's advantages make it an interesting choice for an UU team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a rare typing, good Defense, and Rain Dance, Wormadam-G makes a useful Rain Dance supporter. Rain Dance is a given on a set like this, and it also helps Wormadam-G deal with its Fire-type weakness. Bug Bite discourages Grass-types such as Sceptile, which would otherwise greatly threaten Rain Dance teams, from switching in. Earthquake is a strong STAB attack that allows Wormadam-G to damage Pokemon like Lanturn, which are problematic to rain sweepers. Finally, Toxic helps wear down bulky Pokemon such as Milotic and Blastoise.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature give Wormadam-G a good amount of bulk and enough power to discourage switch-ins. Wormadam-G lures in many Fire-types, so Omastar and Kabutops make great partners with their 4x resistance to Fire. They are also effective rain sweepers that appreciate Wormadam-G's ability to cripple bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro with Toxic. Lanturn is another notable teammate to consider, because it defeats bulky Water-types with ease. Additionally, Lanturn's Water STAB becomes boosted and Thunder receives 100% accuracy with Wormadam-G's rain support. Note that bulky Water-types can also take advantage of Rain Dance, so be prepared with Water immune Pokemon such as Toxicroak.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Toxic
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a RestTalk set, Wormadam-G can abuse its resistances and good Defense to their fullest potential. Rest allows it to recover off damage and cure status, while Sleep Talk gives it the ability to not be entirely useless for the two turns spent sleeping. Earthquake is recommended so Wormadam-G isn't completely ruined by Taunt, and it deters opposing Fire-types from switching in. Toxic deals with bulky Pokemon that attempt to switch into Wormadam-G, such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Arcanine.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since Wormadam-G is weak to Fire-, Ice-, and Water-type moves, bulky Waters such as Milotic make great partners. If Wormadam-G manages to Toxic any of these Pokemon, then Milotic can stall them to death with Recover. Clefable is a decent special wall that can help out Wormadam-G by setting up Stealth Rock, crippling potential counters with Trick, and draining the foe's HP with Seismic Toss; also, its Fighting weakness can be covered by Wormadam-G. Unfortunately, Wormadam-G has a number of other counters. Weezing completely walls this set, thanks to its immunity to Toxic and Earthquake, and can burn off Wormadam-G with Fire Blast. Moltres also threatens Wormadam-G with STAB Fire Blast and Air Slash, but it does not appreciate Toxic. With its immunity to Earthquake and ability to absorb Toxic with Guts, Swellow can switch in effortlessly and threaten to KO Wormadam-G with STAB Brave Bird. To stop Weezing, Moltres, and Swellow, the aforementioned Milotic in combination with Substitute Rhyperior can help. Both Milotic and Rhyperior can survive most of their attacks, and then strike back with Surf and Stone Edge, respectively; Rhyperior has the added bonus of setting up Substitute to block Weezing's Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Wormadam-G barely has any viable options that are not already listed on the sets above. Sucker Punch can be used to hurt faster attackers, while Rock Blast can help it take down Substitutes and Flying-types immune to Earthquake. It can also use Endeavor and Flail on a gimmick set, but it will most likely die before it is able to use them. Wormadam-G has Earth Power, Psychic, Signal Beam, and Shadow Ball on the special side, but its base Special Attack stat is truly appalling. Skill Swap has a chance to steal a useful ability that Wormadam-G can then call its own, such as Arcanine's Flash Fire.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Weezing is the best counter to Wormadam-G, due to its immunity to both Earthquake and Toxic, resistance to Bug Bite, and access to Will-O-Wisp and Fire Blast. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise can absorb Wormadam-G's attacks easily, and take advantage of the rain that Wormadam-G provides. RestTalk Milotic is especially threatening, as it can Rest off Toxic, and then attack with super effective Surfs and Ice Beams via Sleep Talk. Moltres is immune to Earthquake, and can OHKO Wormadam-G with STAB Fire Blast and Air Slash. However, it must be wary of Toxic.</p>
