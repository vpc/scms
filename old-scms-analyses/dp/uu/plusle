[Overview]

<p>Plusle comes as the third generation's cute Electric-type mouse alongside Minun. While no one can deny his captivating charm, his stats are unfortunately mediocre, and his movepool is nothing to write home about. Because of this, Plusle is often forgotten in favor of other fast, specially-offensive Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu and Manectric. Still, Plusle's unique combination of Nasty Plot, Encore, and Baton Pass gives a good reason to use him over his competitors. Plusle might not seem threatening at first glance, but underestimate him at your own peril, as it could result in a Pokemon sweeping through your team with the boosts Plusle has accumulated and Baton Passed.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Plusle's decent offensive power and access to Encore to make him an effective Nasty Plot Baton Passer that can pose an offensive threat at the same time. Encore allows Plusle to lock defensive Pokemon, such as Registeel, into a harmless move like Stealth Rock, effectively giving Plusle a free turn to set up. As Plusle is extremely frail, Encore is often very important to obtain a Nasty Plot boost. Thunderbolt gives Plusle a reliable attack, which prevents him from being completely useless if he gets Taunted, and is fairly powerful after a Nasty Plot.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This EV spread is simple yet effective: A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs are needed to tie with other positive base 95 Pokemon such as Houndoom. This gives Plusle a 50% chance to Baton Pass the boost in a tight situation against them, or KO the opposing Pokemon with a Nasty Plot boosted Thunderbolt. 252 Special Attack EVs boost the power of Plusle's Thunderbolt, and allow Plusle to strike the opposing team with strong attacks. While it may seem odd to boost Plusle's Special Attack when Thunderbolt is his only offensive move, the Electric-type boasts respectable mono-coverage in UU, and any opponents that resist Thunderbolt can easily be Baton Passed out of. However, some defensive EVs can be transferred from Special Attack to make it easier for Plusle to obtain a Nasty Plot boost, but so many EVs are required that Plusle becomes pitifully weak, which makes this a lesser option.</p>

<p>Plusle has a couple of other moves that he can use on this set. Agility is always useful to Baton Pass, but Nasty Plot is what makes Plusle unique. You may, however, forgo the use of Thunderbolt in favor of Agility if you wish. Magnet Rise can be an interesting option to Baton Pass, but like Agility, it should only go over Thunderbolt. It should be noted that replacing Thunderbolt with either Agility or Magnet Rise leaves Plusle rendered utterly useless by Taunt, so it isn't recommended. Hidden Power Ice allows Plusle to hit Ground-types he can't hit with Thunderbolt, but there are no moves that you can really replace on this set.</p>

<p>As this set's main goal is to pass Nasty Plot boosts, appropriate recipients are naturally important teammates. If possible, these Baton Pass recipients should also be able to deal with Ground-type Pokemon. Therefore, Moltres, Mismagius, Rotom, and Sceptile are all excellent partners, as they benefit greatly from a Nasty Plot boost, and are immune or resistant to Ground-type attacks. All of these Pokemon pack incredible powerful after a Nasty Plot boost, and are fast enough to attempt a sweep.</p>

<p>Because both Plusle and his Baton Pass recipients are specially-based, dedicated special sponges such as Chansey can pose problems. Even after a Nasty Plot boost, Baton Pass recipients may still face problems with the pink blob. Dugtrio is a great choice to trap and KO Chansey in one fell swoop. U-turn users, such as Scyther and Swellow, also help weaken the opposing team and scout for any Pokemon that may pose a problem to your Baton Pass recipient.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Plusle is generally outclassed by other Electric-type Pokemon when it comes to sweeping, he can still be a decent Nasty Plot sweeper. Nasty Plot is an excellent boosting move that can quickly boost Plusle's average Special Attack to higher levels. Encore allows Plusle to capitalize on support moves with ease, and it's almost a necessity for Plusle to set up, since his overall frailty means that he cannot switch into attacking moves that are even moderately powerful. Thunderbolt is Plusle's main STAB attack, while Hidden Power Ice provides excellent coverage alongside it. Life Orb is the item of choice, as Plusle needs all the power he can get.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Plusle has a couple of other options that he can use with decent results. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to strike Registeel and Steelix for decent damage, while Grass Knot is available to hit Rhyperior and Donphan harder than Hidden Power Ice. However, these attacks have worse overall coverage with Thunderbolt in comparison to Hidden Power Ice. Baton Pass is an option to scout for counters, and possibly Baton Pass a Nasty Plot boost to a partner, but Plusle needs all the coverage he can get in order to successfully sweep. You can also transfer some Special Attack EVs to HP to make setting up a Nasty Plot somewhat easier.</p>

<p>Since Plusle is still somewhat offensively weak, even after a Nasty Plot boost, some support is necessary for Plusle to sweep; in particular, entry hazards score Plusle some OHKOes and 2HKOes that he couldn't get otherwise. Omastar is a superb entry hazard supporter that has enough bulk to switch in multiple times during a match to set up entry hazards. Qwilfish is also a decent option as he can quickly set up a layer or two of Spikes before fainting. Scyther and Swellow can both slowly weaken opposing walls with U-turn, which will gradually allow Plusle to overcome these walls. Dugtrio is also a great teammate to trap and KO Chansey and Registeel, both of which can easily sponge Plusle's attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Plusle's movepool isn't particularly expansive, but he does have a couple of interesting options. Plusle has access to Wish and status moves in Sing and Thunder Wave. Since Plusle also has access to moves such as Baton Pass and Encore, he can pull off a support set; however, Plusle's extremely poor defenses make this a mediocre option. Fake Tears can be used, but for the most part Plusle prefers Nasty Plot since it's Baton Passable. Signal Beam is a special attack that Plusle can use, but it has poor coverage alongside Thunderbolt. Plusle could also attempt a gimmicky anti-lead set with Focus Sash, Counter, Encore, Thunderbolt, and Quick Attack; Counter can KO physical leads, Encore can lock a lead into Stealth Rock, and Quick Attack can finish Focus Sash leads off, but it's really just that– a gimmick.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The main problem with countering Plusle is Baton Pass. Baton Pass makes it so that it isn't just about dealing with Plusle– it means you have to prevent Plusle from passing his boosts to something more deadly, or have the ability to deal with the recipient. Because of this, the best counters to Plusle are bulky phazers. Venusaur with Roar can easily take anything Plusle throws at it, and can use Roar to phaze Plusle. Lanturn, Registeel, and Chansey are also good counters as they all take little damage from Plusle's attacks and can paralyze Baton Pass recipients with Thunder Wave. It should be noted that Plusle isn't all that powerful on his own, and most of the time, dedicated special sponges aren't really necessary to deal with him.</p>

<p>Faster Pokemon can easily outspeed and KO Plusle. Dugtrio is particularly effective since he can trap Plusle with Arena Trap and OHKO him with Earthquake. If a faster sweeper isn't available on your team, then priority is also a great way to take down Plusle. Plusle isn't very bulky, so strong priority attacks should take him down, although some prior damage may be necessary. Arcanine's ExtremeSpeed is a great example of this, as it will easily KO any variant of Plusle after a little residual damage.</p>
