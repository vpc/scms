[Overview]

<p>Hypno is a good, underrated Pokemon; he is not as good as other Psychic-types like Alakazam and Starmie, but he is pretty versatile. His stats are average across the board and he's sorely lacking the Speed other Psychic Pokemon have, but combined with a very good movepool, he becomes a decent Pokemon used to fill multiple roles. While Hypno's lackluster Speed leaves more to be desired, it is still a very viable option to use if you get tired of Pokemon like Alakazam, Exeggutor, etc. However, with no instant recovery move, Hypno can be difficult to keep alive.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hypno works well in the place of a lot of standards. He can absorb special hits reasonably well, if you want to replace Chansey. If you want a replacement for Exeggutor, he can do that well with Hypnosis and Thunder Wave acting as Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. He also works well as a sort of poor-man's Alakazam. Hypnosis works well with Counter. For example, switch Hypno into a Snorlax Body Slam, and put him to sleep. Use Counter for a lot of damage on Snorlax or a likely OHKO on whatever switches in.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hypno has quite a few options, but not one sticks out as the best. Mimic can net you Recover, Ice Beam, or Thunderbolt. Seismic Toss is good to hit other Psychic-types harder then Psychic would. Body Slam is a decent option for steady damage and paralysis. Reflect can help you survive more attacks, while you do some damage and Rest off any damage you receive.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chansey and Starmie take little to no damage from Hypno's attacks, and can just heal any damage they do take. Slowbro resists Psychic, takes little damage from Body Slam, and doesn't mind being paralyzed. While Hypno has decent Defense, the lack of an instant recovery move hurts him—something physical attackers can take advantage of. Double-Edge Exeggutor isn't hurt by Hypno's attacks and can 3HKO Hypno. Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres can all switch in easily and hurt Hypno.</p>
