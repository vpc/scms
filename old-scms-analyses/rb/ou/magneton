[Overview]

<p>While Magneton has decent Special, there are a lot of things that wall it, including two of the most common Pokémon, Golem and Rhydon. If you really want to try it out, it needs a ton of support to do anything at all. It can, however, hurt teams once you've taken Rhydon/Golem down.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Thunder / Thunderbolt
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Mimic
move 4: Hyper Beam / Double-Edge

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When you look at Magneton's movepool, you can see why it is not used at all. It has uncharacteristically low Speed for an Electric-type and a very limited movepool. Most Water-types easily beat Rhydon and Golem, both of whom completely counter Magneton, so it's wise to use Magneton with one. If you feel lucky, try Thunder and Hyper Beam; if Chansey is at around 80% health on the switch, a Thunder followed by a critical hit Hyper Beam KOs her. Every team with Magneton needs something to beat Chansey and Exeggutor, too. Also, if you can Mimic Chansey's Softboiled, or even a weakened one's Ice Beam, go nuts.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect boosts its already decent Defense, and Screech and Flash could perhaps force switches. Supersonic is inaccurate, but it can work for parafusion with some luck.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Golem and Rhydon take nothing at all from the Electric / Normal attacking combination Magneton uses, as does Onix if you're playing in UU. Other Ground-types work as great counters too, but need to be wary of switching into a Hyper Beam. Chansey doesn't care about Thunderbolt and can Softboiled off Double-Edge damage while chipping away at Magneton with Ice Beam. Exeggutor resists Electric and has a high enough Defense to laugh at Double-Edge. Honorable mention goes to Tangela, which resists Thunderbolt and shrugs off Double-Edge.</p>
