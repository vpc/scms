[Overview]

<p>With its good Attack, it can sweep a slow or paralyzed team if used right, but it dies really quickly to special attackers. Because of this, it will be quite hard to switch Pinsir in and pull it off.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Hyper Beam
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Submission

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Simply Swords Dance and sweep. Watch out, though, as this set can't touch Gengar, and Gengar is very common. Also, Pinsir's Special is rubbish—it usually just barely survives two hits from Starmie's Surf, but most other STAB special moves will 2HKO Pinsir.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Seismic Toss hits Gengar, and its Slash is quite strong and can come in handy if you don't have the time to Swords Dance. Guillotine is also an option if OHKO moves are unbanned.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Given the standard set, Pinsir has no way to damage Gengar, whose Thunderbolt makes short work of it. Exeggutor's good Defense allows him the ability to switch in with little consequence, and his high Special gives him the ability to take down Pinsir with Psychic. Zapdos can switch in on anything, although Body Slam has an ugly chance of paralysis. As far as UU goes, Tangela doesn't fear anything Pinsir has. Arcanine and Ninetales can switch in and threaten Pinsir with a STAB Fire Blast, but they don't like getting paralyzed.</p>
