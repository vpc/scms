[Overview]

<p>If used at the right time in a UU match, Scyther can be quite surprising and can manage to sweep your entire team. However, refrain from using him in an OU match as he can't take a hit, and won't be allowed to sweep.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance + Agility 
move 1: Slash
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Agility
move 4: Hyper Beam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you switch Scyther in, you need to be almost positive that your opponent is not using an attacking move. Swords Dance on the switch, Agility if needed, and sweep with Hyper Beam. It's quite basic, really. Slash should be used if Scyther doesn't get an opportunity to Swords Dance, but unfortunately its critical hit rate will nullify Swords Dance when it is used.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Double-Edge might be useful, since he'll die fast anyway, or maybe Substitute.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gengar takes no damage from Scyther's astonishing array of Normal-type moves. Likewise, Golem and Rhydon have a field day exploiting Scyther's lack of any move that can hit Rock-types. Onix is basically a UU Rhydon—he takes nothing from Scyther's attacks. Aerodactyl outspeeds Scyther, and can hit him hard with Double-Edge or Fire Blast. Fire Pokémon, especially Arcanine, will also severely cripple Scyther.</p>
