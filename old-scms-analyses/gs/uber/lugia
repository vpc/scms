[Overview]

<p>Lugia can be a nice wildcard in Uber battles. It would have been fantastic if it could set up dual screens with those amazing defenses in GSC, but oh well. It still tanks hits perfectly, and hits hard as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Aeroblast
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Recover / Rest
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lugia is really more defense-oriented than Ho-Oh, but can be made offensive, as evidenced by the moveset above. Despite having 3 fairly common special weaknesses, its high HP and Special Defense allow it to be a godly Curse user. It can conceivably beat CurseLax with a couple critical hits with Aeroblast. This set has its problems, however. First, Skarmory and Zapdos completely nullify this. Second, Aeroblast's low PP hurt it as well, so it's best to only let loose once Lugia has a fair amount of Curses under its belt.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Psych Up + Whirlwind can be a fun combo if your opponent is trying to set up Curse against Lugia. Other than that, the other moves just depend on what you really want to beat. It learns a plethora of great special attacks like Thunder, Thunderbolt, Hydro Pump, Psychic, and Ice Beam.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Zapdos and Skarmory seem to be the only viable counters. Aerodactyl can be to some extent (assuming it is the Curse set), as well as some Pokémon with Curse and Roar.</p>
