[Overview]

<p>To be honest, Ho-Oh's probably the worst GSC Uber, but that's not really saying a lot. Ho-Oh's main problem is the fact that there are only four moveslots. Otherwise, it would probably be the best Uber. Ho-Oh has great stats, but so do all the Ubers, so it's best as a cleaner if you can get Blissey or Skarmory out the way.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard Sweeper
move 1: Recover
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Sacred Fire
move 4: Earthquake / Shadow Ball
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the general cleaning set. Fire and Electric covers most special weaknesses, and the 50% burn chance of Sacred Fire is awesome. The last move is up to you—Earthquake is generally the better move. However, you might also want to try Shadow Ball—it's super effective against the Psychic-types (Mew, Mewtwo, Lugia, and Celebi) and has a chance of lowering the Special Defense of threats like Suicune.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Recover
move 3: Return
move 4: Whirlwind / Sacred Fire / Shadow Ball
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of the most basic sets in the book can catch people completely off guard. Return is awfully generic, but it's neutral to most Pokemon in the Uber metagame save for Skarmory. There are multiple choices for the last slot. Whirlwind is probably your best bet and is used to avoid being phazed (and at the same time to phaze other Uber Curse users), Sacred Fire is used to nail two of the main Uber phazers (Skarmory, Celebi) and burn Tyranitar and Rhydon, and Shadow Ball blasts away those annoying Psychic-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ho-Oh can use Sunny Day and SolarBeam in conjunction with Sacred Fire, but Ho-Oh will just end up being walled by Blissey.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If Ho-Oh doesn't have Hidden Power Fighting or Curse, Blissey can stall it out, but not without suffering a possible burn. Most of the other Ubers can handle it since it doesn't really have anything that can force a switch, and it's not great at sweeping. If Ho-Oh has Shadow Ball instead of Earthquake, Tyranitar and Rhydon can handle it with little to no trouble, though they despise being burned by Sacred Fire.</p>
