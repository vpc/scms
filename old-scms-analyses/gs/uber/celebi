[Overview]

<p>Celebi has great stats, and resistances to three of the most popular attack types in the game is never bad (Water / Electric / Ground). One thing Celebi doesn't get its due credit for is being able to stall out the average Snorlax and force it to Rest without taking much damage thanks to Leech Seed. It also learns Heal Bell, which is one of the most valuable moves for a stall team, and is still useful for others.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Heal Bell
move 2: Recover
move 3: Leech Seed
move 4: Psychic
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a support set and pretty much all that Celebi has going for it in GSC. Heal Bell helps the rest of the team, Recover helps Celebi itself, Psychic gets STAB and uses Celebi's good Special Attack, and Leech Seed can force switches.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Perish Song can act as a phazing move. Celebi can just stall with Recover until the three rounds are up. It pulls the Perish Song job very well with its good defenses. It also allows a stall team to not worry about a last-Pokémon Curse sweep. Giga Drain is a good move but frankly it isn't advisable. Celebi already has a recovery move, and unlike Exeggutor, Celebi is more defensive and should be played as such. An interesting option you could try is Curse coupled with Baton Pass, but it might leave you in a bind when Houndoom shows up.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Houndoom and Tyranitar are really the only Pokemon that will take it down with certainty. Espeon can set up Substitute and Growth before passing to a teammate with Flamethrower. Zapdos has a chance to stop it with Drill Peck. Jynx has a good chance too, thanks to the double threat of STAB Ice Beam and Lovely Kiss, and its low HP means Celebi won't regain much with Leech Seed. If Celebi is paralyzed, Heracross and Pinsir make good counters. Charizard may be able to set up a Belly Drum on Celebi, or just nail it with STAB Fire Blast. Really though, Celebi can be hard to take out.</p>
