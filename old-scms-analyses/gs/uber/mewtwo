[Overview]

<p>Mewtwo can't sweep fast, but it's good late-game. It's not as good as it is in RBY, but it's still Uber to the max. Mewtwo absolutely needs to have Submission—otherwise Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar are going to wall it to hell and back.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Recover
move 3: Submission
move 4: Thunderbolt / Psychic / Fire Blast / Shadow Ball
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Curse bolsters Mewtwo's Attack and cushions its Defense. Let loose with Submission when you feel the timing is right. If your opponent tries to stop you with a physical wall or Ghost-type, counter it with the move of your choice. Thunderbolt has the best overall utility in the Uber metagame for the last slot. Shadow Ball is a possibility too, but it leaves Mewtwo kinda stuck against Skarmory and, to an extent, Lugia (since most of those have Curse). I know it seems like a crime not to use that 406 Special Attack, but in the Uber metagame, special attacks aren't going to do a lot to the likes of Ho-Oh and Lugia.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mewtwo can use Selfdestruct effectively. There's Ice Beam to run from that nice Special Attack stat too. If you're scared of status, such as Sacred Fire's burn, Mewtwo can use Rest. Mewtwo learns Thunder Wave, something that could be handy in the Uber metagame if your opponent doesn't have a cleric.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Umbreon can use Charm to stall out Mewtwo, but it can't take too many Submissions on the switch in. If you can paralyze Mewtwo and get lucky, Heracross has a chance to take it out. If it doesn't have Submission, any of the special walls can usually stall it out—Blissey, Umbreon, and Snorlax in particular.</p>
