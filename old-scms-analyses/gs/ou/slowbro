[Overview]

<p>Slowbro is definitely one of the best Water-types in the game. It's one of the few that can take a licking and keep on ticking, and it also has good stats. Its lack of Speed is made up for with Thunder Wave, and it has a better movepool than the other high-defenses Water-type, Suicune. It's also very cool and is always a decent option for a Water-type.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Slowbro is arguably the best Thunder Wave user in the game with its low Speed and high Defense. Surf and Psychic both get STAB and do nicely from 298 Special Attack. Psychic also makes Slowbro a pretty decent answer to Tentacruel. When Slowbro's on low health, heal up with Rest—Slowbro can easily survive the downtime.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Slowbro has a bunch of them of other options. Slowbro learns other good attacks like Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and even DynamicPunch for Blissey and Snorlax. Zap Cannon is also cool for dealing loads of damage to other Water-types (Starmie in particular) while still being able to paralyze the opponent. With its high HP and Defense, Counter is another viable option—Slowbro can take a lot of hard hits, even if the opponent has a Curse or two under its belt. And if you're a hardcore staller, Growl can be a pain for Curse users.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Slowbro is a bit difficult to KO quickly due to its high defenses, but Electric-types are definitely the best bet. Especially powerful ones with Rest are the best to use; these include Raikou and Zapdos. Snorlax can easily set up with Curse with reckless abandon against Slowbro's Surfs. Starmie's Thunderbolt also works to wear Slowbro down while Starmie itself takes almost nothing due to its resistances to Water and Psychic, and it heals off what little damage it takes with Recover. Exeggutor has no real healing, but a super effective Giga Drain will maintain its health.</p>
