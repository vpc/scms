[Overview]

<p>Xatu is pretty fun to use. It's just outclassed by other Psychic Pokémon, and being part Flying only gives it more weaknesses that it can't compensate for. Xatu is strictly a UU Psychic-type, since Alakazam and Starmie can do much, MUCH more for themselves and their team than Xatu.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Drill Peck
move 3: Confuse Ray / Night Shade
move 4: Giga Drain / Faint Attack / Haze
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The first two moves run off Xatu's STAB, and 248 Attack Drill Peck isn't horrible, but don't think you'll sweep a lot with it alone. The last two moves are toss-ups. Use Confuse Ray if you feel lucky, use Night Shade so Xatu hit everything non-Normal-type for consistent damage. Use Giga Drain if you hate Golem and Rhydon, Faint Attack is there for Psychic-types not named Alakazam and Starmie, and Haze could be fun if you're suicidal.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Toxic with Nightmare might be good for a laugh against Rest-oriented teams. Safeguard can help Xatu and its team. As always, Thief is a good option since it can hurt certain Pokémon by taking their valuable Leftovers.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most strong physical attackers, excluding those extremely weak to Drill Peck or Psychic like Heracross, will take care of Xatu reasonably well. Steel-types in general, including Scizor and Magneton, tend to be enormous pains because of their resistance to all of Xatu's attacks.</p>
