[Overview]

<p>Noctowl isn't bad, it just doesn't excel at anything in particular. It has tankish stats (403 HP, 290 Special Defense, and Reflect for its 198 Defense). If played right, Noctowl can be a real pain in the UU metagame.</p>

[SET]
name: Reflect
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Night Shade
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This can be pretty effective when used right, actually. Hypnosis what you can't beat, Reflect up, and use Night Shade on random things. Rest when needed, and run when any Normal-type Pokémon shows up.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Curse
move 3: Return
move 4: Rest / Hidden Power Flying
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hypnosis anything that may counter it, Curse up, and hit stuff with your STAB attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Faint Attack is a good option because 250 Special Attack isn't exactly horrible (though it isn't great either). Growl might be fun to use against Curse users, and Mirror Move might surprise someone. Whirlwind should be used with Reflect since Noctowl's low 198 Defense hurts. Nightmare isn't a bad idea with Hypnosis, because there is a large amount of RestTalk users in GSC as well. Using Nightmare against those RestTalk Pokemon will make them think twice about Resting again.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Physical attackers, RestTalk users, Rock and/or Steel Pokémon, Normal-types, as well as Electric Pokémon counter Noctowl effectively. Yeah, Noctowl isn't going to hurt all that much.</p>
