[Overview]

<p>The worst Pokémon Nintendo ever made. No hit-taking abilities and no HP stat make this one of the most useless Pokémon there is. The idea was nice, and it can be annoying to fight in-game at times...but really, this is nothing you would want to consider even on your UU teams. Use this purely as a novelty Pokémon, as there is no other use for Ditto. In-game however, it is very important for breeding purposes. At least it has that going for it.</p>

[SET]
name: The Set
move 1: Transform
item: Metal Powder

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ditto is probably, along with his friend Unown, one of the most odd and peculiar Pokémon that can be found. It learns only Transform naturally, which enables it to copy the appearance of its opponent and use that opponent's moves and take on its type. However, it will take a hit before doing so, so really it's going to die before it gets any moves off. Poor Ditto. Ditto isn't really going to do anything.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Leftovers can be used over Metal Powder, maybe, but Metal Powder adds 50% to both defenses, so Ditto can at least have some advantage over what it turns into. Ditto has no other possible move options than what is listed above, because Transform is all it learns.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a super effective or neutral move against its own type. In other words, just about anything can beat Ditto, but Ditto can hurt nothing. Use a quick strong sweeper if you want to put it out of its misery quickly. Really, as long as you don't switch to Cloyster or something (giving them free Spikes + Explosion), anything counters Ditto.</p>
