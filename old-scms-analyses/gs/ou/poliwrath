[Overview]

<p>Poliwrath really isn't that good of a Pokémon. One of his main problems is his typing. While Water and Fighting are both good attacking types, Poliwrath's attacking stats leave something to be desired; in addition, in both the UU and OU metagame there are just a ton of common attacks that will counter him. His stats are actually even all around, but therein lies the problem; he isn't quite good enough at anything in particular to be of much use. In a UU arena dominated by Pokémon like Lapras and Clefable, he could be potent with STAB on Fighting moves, but he has nary a chance to make an impact on the OU metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to the NYPC, Poliwrath gets Lovely Kiss, which is a great surprise to utilize since most people don't know what moves Poliwrath even learns. The idea here is to paralyze most of the opponent's team with Body Slam (and help from the rest of the team doesn't hurt), and when everything is weakened, set up Belly Drum and take the match. Hydro Pump will really hurt those Rock-types and can soften up physical walls like Skarmory. Lovely Kiss is Poliwrath's wild card, so whenever they bring out a Pokemon they think can beat it, use Lovely Kiss and put it to sleep before it can take Poliwrath out. While this is a good idea in theory, Poliwrath is hindered by horrible typing and a bad physical movepool and can't hit anything directly hard off the bat. You can try out other attacks like Earthquake or Hidden Power Fighting (for STAB) to hit various other Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Poliwrath certainly learns a lot of moves, not many of them are going to be much use on him. Counter is quite possibly the only one that stands out... with his Defense and HP, he can survive a really hard hit and Counter it back for a KO. There's also Submission and DynamicPunch to take advantage of that potentially great Fighting STAB.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Three Pokemon have the perfect typing to wall Poliwrath indefinitely: Exeggutor, Starmie, and Slowbro. The first two of these are extremely common, and Slowbro is one of those crazy "BL" types, so many teams can counter Poliwrath with ease without even considering him. Other common counters would be Raikou, Zapdos, Umbreon, Suicune and even Snorlax if Poliwrath doesn't have a Fighting move. If you're in UU, there are plenty of counters to be found as well. Gyarados can wall Poliwrath's typing, Lanturn can take him on, and Muk can absorb Poliwrath's attacks with little trouble (unless Poliwrath has Earthquake). Grass-types like Meganium and Venusaur will also take on Poliwrath with ease. There are just a lot of counters to the poor tadpole.</p>
