[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Azumarill isn't exactly a good Pokémon. It has great HP and decent defenses, but its offensive stats are bad. Because Azumarill's physical movepool is so poor, Return is your best bet for consistent damage. The Water-type attack covers any Rock- or Steel-types you may encounter, and Hidden Power Ghost deals with Gengar and Misdreavus to some extent. You'll want to use Return over Double-Edge because Curse will make you more of a tank, so you don't want to lose your HP to Double-Edge.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ice Beam is there so Azumarill has a chance against Dragonite and Grass-types. Iron Tail is an alternate physical attack, but it's rather useless since Hydro Pump beats whatever Iron Tail would beat, except for Ice-types. Light Screen helps your team, which isn't a bad idea, since Azumarill only has special-typed weaknesses. Perish Song works for phazing. Rest lets Azumarill stick around for a while behind that high HP and those decent defenses.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Azumarill is quite slow, so many Electric- and Grass-types get the jump on it before it can use its Belly Drum set to its full potential. Suicune and Omastar aren't impressed, and the former can even Roar Azumarill off. Snorlax beats out Curse Azumarill in a Curse match-up.</p>
