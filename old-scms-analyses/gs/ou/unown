[Overview]

<p>Unown is a horrible Pokémon. It's not fast, it's not strong, and it can't take a hit. Don't use this unless you really want to lose. Or unless you're playing some novelty team which disallows the rest of the Pokemon in the game or something.</p>

[SET]
name: The Power Within
move 1: Hidden Power Psychic
move 2: 
move 3: 
move 4: 
item: TwistedSpoon

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pretty simple set I would say. Hidden Power Psychic is chosen because of STAB. TwistedSpoon is there because it won't be able to take any hits so Leftovers is pointless, so you might as well boost Hidden Power a bit. Don't expect this to beat anything, though.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can choose any other Hidden Power type.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that doesn't die in one hit to Hidden Power or is fast enough. Since Unown has a really hard time OHKOing anything in the first place, you probably won't have a hard time beating it.</p>
