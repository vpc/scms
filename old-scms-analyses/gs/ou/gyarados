[Overview]

<p>Anyone smart will probably notice that there are many similarities between Dragonite and Gyarados, but Dragonite can probably do most of what Gyarados can do <em>better</em>. There is only one advantage that Gyarados has: people don't know what to expect from it. It is so left out and underestimated that it is very easy to surprise the opponent with your movesets, as long as you use them with intelligence—people stay more on guard against Dragonite. A good combo to note is Gyarados and Steelix. Both cover each other's weaknesses incredibly well.</p>

item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This won't KO anything off the bat, but is great in the late-game. It takes a lot of prediction, so get those thinking caps on. Double-Edge deals steady damage, Zap Cannon paralyzes other Water-types, Hydro Pump has STAB, and Hidden Power Ground maims Electric-types from that nice attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gyarados has a very good array of moves to choose from. It can stall with its stats and Toxic, and it can Curse up if you can get those Electrics out of the way. It learns Reflect which is always good in GSC, and Roar to phaze.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As Gyarados is quadruply weak to Electric-type attacks, most anything with Thunderbolt will 2HKO it. However, most Electrics have poor Defense with which to take Hidden Power Ground, but Zapdos and non-Electric-types are effective. For example, Porygon2's fairly evenly distributed defenses and Recover will keep it up against Gyarados.</p>
