[Overview]

<p>While his stats overall are a tad overshadowed by Rhydon's, Explosion levels the field between the two. Golem has the strongest Explosion in the game, so look out. Curse makes him a great deterrent for Misdreavus—simply Curse while it Perish Songs and Protects, and Explode on whatever comes out—the only thing that it doesn't OHKO 100% of the time is Steelix.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Curse, then attack with what you see fit. Explode on anything that spells trouble. Counter is a nice option that could surprise a Heracross, Marowak, or Machamp (if you want to gamble on a non-critical hit Cross Chop).</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Golem makes a good phazer with Roar, though if you're looking for a phazer you should probably use Rhydon. Fire Blast can be used for Steel-types (Skarmory and Forretress in particular).</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grass- and Water-types tend to fare well against Rock and Ground attacks, and also hit Golem's 4x weaknesses. A Giga Drain or Surf from Exeggutor, Meganium, Slowbro, Suicune, and others will easily OHKO it. Forretress and Skarmory take its attacks well, and Forretress can even set up Spikes on it. Overall, any special attack that Golem doesn't resist will take it out.</p>
