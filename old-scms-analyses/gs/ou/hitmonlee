[Overview]

<p>Whenever you want to use Hitmonlee, consider Primeape, Machamp, and Heracross first. They are generally better. Hitmonlee has the advantage of more Attack than Primeape and more Speed than most other Fighting-types. Unfortunately for Hitmonlee, Primeape's Cross Chop is still stronger than Hitmonlee's Hi Jump Kick, though the latter is more accurate.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>STAB Hi Jump Kick off 338 Attack isn't that bad. Meditate is best used on switches and boosts said Attack higher. Then pick a good physical Hidden Power to run with; Rock against Flying-types, Ghost for Ghost- and Psychic-types, or Bug for Psychic-types in general and Exeggutor in particular. Return is just filler for lack of a better move to help cover what your Hidden Power doesn't hit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter is an option since most non-boosted Flying attacks don't OHKO Hitmonlee. Curse can be good since Hitmonlee has that 318 Special Defense and could <strong>really</strong> do with more Defense. Body Slam could be used in lieu of Return for the nice chance of paralysis. DynamicPunch is inaccurate, but stronger than Hi Jump Kick, and gives the chance of confusion. Rapid Spin can be used as a Cloyster counter and somewhat of a Forretress counter, since Forretress never has a move to take out Hitmonlee. Reversal with 272 Speed isn't bad at all, especially with that 338 Attack stat. Substitute can allow some setup if you're bad with prediction. Mint Berry and Rest could be used with Thief, though it only allows you two attacking slots.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hitmonlee's HP is very poor, so it drags down its good Special Defense. Psychic-types resist Hi Jump Kick and hit it super effectively, as do Flying-types. Poison-types with fairly good Defense, such as Weezing and Muk, can chip at Hitmonlee's health quickly. Overall, its defenses are quite lackluster, and therefore many strong attacks will overcome it.</p>
