[Overview]

<p>Venusaur has great overall stats, but is mostly inferior to Meganium due to its typing. Venusaur doesn't learn Sludge Bomb in GSC; if it did, it'd probably be a lot more popular. In addition, the move Razor Leaf also lost the incredible critical hit ratio that it had in RBY, making it less of a threat.</p>

[SET]
name: Defensive
move 1: Synthesis
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Razor Leaf
move 4: Sleep Powder / Reflect
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The goal with this set is to put something to sleep with Sleep Powder and stall the enemy out with Leech Seed and Razor Leaf. Reflect + Leech Seed works too if you don't like Sleep Powder's accuracy. Though you'll probably want to use Sleep Powder; Meganium outclasses it in stalling in every way otherwise.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Body Slam
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Sleep Powder
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a good idea in theory, but loses badly to Skarmory, as do many "good ideas" involving physical sweepers. Set up Swords Dance, then put any possible counters to sleep. Hopefully Body Slam will grant Venusaur some paralysis for fast counters, and Giga Drain will waste Rock-, Ground-, and some Water-types (in addition to replenishing some health). If you want to, you can slip Synthesis over Sleep Powder for more recovery (in which case you could use Razor Leaf instead of Giga Drain) because Venusaur has awesome survivability.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Venusaur does learn Light Screen, which is a somewhat rare move. You could also use a Growth set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fire-, Flying-, Poison-, and Steel-type Pokémon are all resistant to Grass and hit Venusaur pretty hard. Special mention goes to Skarmory for its 4x resistance to Grass and resistance to Body Slam, as well as its ability to Whirlwind Venusaur out if need be. Exeggutor is immune to Leech Seed and can strike back with a super effective Psychic.</p>
