[Overview]

<p>Lack of good attacking moves, and a poor typing really hurts Articuno. Its typing ruins it from doing the only thing it's "made" to do, and that's tank / sponge. Its sparse movepool prevents Articuno from attempting to find another role for itself, not that it could anyway.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Toxic / Hidden Power Electric
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rest and Sleep Talk keep Articuno alive. It has a horrible movepool, anyway, so it won't really notice having those two slots filled.</p>

[SET]
name: Reflect
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Toxic / Hidden Power Electric / Roar
move 3: Reflect
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Reflect gives Articuno a slight chance against Rock Slide users and lets your whole team take physical attacks a bit better. Note that in most formats, Hidden Power legendaries are banned, meaning Articuno would have to use Toxic or Roar that slot.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Given its Special Defense, a Curse set wouldn't be bad, except for Articuno's nasty physical weaknesses. It's best to just pass Reflect and take advantage of that STAB Ice Beam.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything carrying Rock Slide will scare Articuno. Blissey and Snorlax can take its hits all day. Blissey can have some trouble actually damaging Articuno enough, though, thanks to Rest. Water and Ice Pokémon stop Articuno easily, but again, have difficulties damaging it enough to not be stalled, themselves. Any Fire-type can stop Articuno easily, especially Charizard.</p>
