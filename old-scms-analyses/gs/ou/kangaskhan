[Overview]

<p>Kangaskhan is a Pokémon that's kinda out there in no man's land. Its stats are incredibly well-rounded and proportioned quite nicely. Its Speed is surprisingly nice for a huge Mongolian kangaroo and it can finish off Pokémon with a lower Speed than 278. It is capable of sweeping a team with no trouble at all without a real fear of being phazed. After a few Curses, even Skarmory and Rhydon aren't going to be able to be much worry for Kangaskhan. The other big thing with Kangaskhan is its ability to put up with special attacks too. It can survive 3 Thunderbolts from Raikou, meaning if it Cursed up and Rested on a Raikou switch-in, it could survive the Rest to KO it. Kangaskhan's just not hard to use at all. However, due to the presence of Snorlax, it quietly remains in the shadow of BL. Since Ghost-types can completely mess up Kangaskhan, you may want to use it with Spikes and/or something with Pursuit to rub out said Ghosts, assuming you want to use Roar over Earthquake.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Rest
move 3: Return
move 4: Roar
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is so simple, and yet it can be so hard to counter. Curse up, hit anything not resistant to Return, Roar away everything that is, Rest, and repeat.</p>

[SET]
name: Attract
move 1: Body Slam
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Attract
move 4: Substitute
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The idea of this is "parattraction" with Substitute. You'll want to paralyze with Body Slam, and then use Attract and Substitute to avoid being hit. Attack Gengar and Misdreavus with Earthquake, as well as the Rock- and Steel-types that come your way. Really the only thing that can negate this totally is a female Skarmory, but who wants to lower their Attack like that? Skarmory will, however, get to use Whirlwind and get past the parattraction eventually.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Body Slam can be used with RestTalk to make one hard-to-take-down kangaroo. Kangaskhan learns a lot of moves, but makes use of only a few of them.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gengar and Misdreavus are completely immune to Normal-type attacks and therefore counter the Curse set, but should beware of Earthquake. Skarmory, Rhydon, and Steelix have very high Defense to serve as a base for phazing the Curse set away. Kangaskhan isn't particularly resilient against very strong attacks, so just assailing it directly is a nice way to get rid of it.</p>
