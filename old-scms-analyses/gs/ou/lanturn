[Overview]

<p>Lanturn is a great Pokémon due to its dual typing. It's more an Electric Pokémon with an added Water-type than the other way around, since you'll really want to use Lanturn in the same manner you would use any other Electric to be successful. Lanturn is one of the few Electric-types that has no problem switching into Water-types, which is great since that's what Electrics do most. Lanturn also has massive HP which lets it take more hits than one might think. It also annoys really well, and can OHKO those Ground-types that resist Thunder Wave.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Surf
move 2: Thunderbolt / Thunder
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The RestTalk version of Lanturn is very durable and extremely useful for sopping up enemy sleep attacks. This set carries both STAB attacks, which provides decent coverage from one Pokémon. Thunder is an option when using with Rest and Sleep Talk for various reasons, all of which relate to the increased staying power of the RestTalk combo and Lanturn's lack of attacking strength. The lower accuracy and PP aren't much of a problem because of Lanturn's durability and Sleep Talk's presence, and the 30% paralysis chance is helpful.</p>

[SET]
name: Parafusion
move 1: Surf
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Confuse Ray
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You can also go the support route with Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray, making it easier for Lanturn's teammates to set-up, not to mention the annoyance this causes. The set still carries both STAB attacks for decent coverage, plus it's very hard for opponents to hit through both paralysis and confusion.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>You can make Lanturn even more annoying by combining confusion and paralysis with Attract to make it hard for your opponent to get in a hit. Rain Dance can be used somewhat effectively over Thunder Wave, and then you can use a 100% accurate Thunder and a beefed up Surf. Ice Beam could be a surprise attack for those Grass-types that resist both of Lanturn's STAB attacks. Toxic can poison the opponent and force it to switch out at some point.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lanturn has fairly good type coverage, but not much power behind its attacks. Grass-types like Meganium, Vileplume, Bellossom, and Victreebel resist both of Lanturn's STAB attacks and hit back super effectively with Giga Drain. Anything with Earthquake that is not weak to Lanturn's attacks should handle it easily, and as always, Blissey and Snorlax stop weaker special attackers like Lanturn indefinitely.</p>
