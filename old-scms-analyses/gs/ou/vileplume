[Overview]

<p>Vileplume is a cool Pokémon. It has decent stats all around, even though Venusaur beats it in stats in just about every way. Luckily for Vileplume, its movepool outclasses Venusaur's with Sludge Bomb and Stun Spore. Vileplume is more of a status inducer than an all-out attacker, and it does well in UU.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Moonlight
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Leech Seed on whatever comes in, and if you think it isn't a RestTalk user, put it to sleep. Use Moonlight for recovery and Sludge Bomb as an attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stun Spore can paralyze stuff, which is good because Vileplume is slow. Swords Dance could make Sludge Bomb hurt, but Victreebel does this better since it's faster and has more Attack. Razor Leaf could be used as an attack (watch out, as Razor Leaf is illegal with Leech Seed), and Reflect could boost its Defense while Vileplume stalls with Leech Seed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>RestTalk Zapdos fears little from this set and can retaliate with STAB Drill Peck. Steelix, Gengar, Tentacruel, and Venusaur aren't overly bothered by it either if Sleep Clause has been activated. Skarmory flat-out walls it.</p>
