[Overview]

<p>Pidgeot has somewhat workable stats. Its problem is its typing and its limited movepool, along with the fact that it's outclassed by other Flying Pokémon. Whatever Pidgeot can do, Fearow and Dodrio can do better. It can be used effectively though, as long as you play well and keep the heavy hitters away from it.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Return
move 2: Hidden Power Flying / Wing Attack
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Steel Wing / Mirror Move / Hidden Power Ground
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The first two moves run off STAB, it just depends on if you want more power or not. The last two moves are up to you. Toxic can help bring enemies into KO range later in the match, Mirror Move can be a nice surprise, and Steel Wing and Hidden Power Ground can be good against Rock-types on switch ins. Steel Wing keeps your DVs maxed and hits Aerodactyl, but Hidden Power Ground has perfect accuracy and hits Magneton and other Steel-types harder, as well as the Rock / Water types (Omastar, Kabutops, Corsola). Just remember that Return hits other Electric-types not named Magneton harder than Hidden Power Ground.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thief is about it. It can be a good option on any Pokémon, since it can completely screw over a threat like Blissey or Snorlax by taking their Leftovers. Other than that, all the other viable possibilities have been listed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pidgeot's Attack is an unimpressive base 80, which means most Rock and Steel Pokémon will take it on well, even if they are weak to Steel Wing or Hidden Power Ground. Omastar, Kabutops, and Sudowoodo will work well; Magneton is of special note, because although it dies horribly to Hidden Power Ground, it 4x resists Steel Wing and Flying attacks, and can very nearly OHKO with Thunderbolt. Other Pokémon with Ice or Electric attacks, such as Raichu, may also work. Weezing's high Defense lets it switch in and Thunderbolt Pidgeot into the ground very easily.</p
