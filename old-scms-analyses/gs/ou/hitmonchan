[Overview]

<p>Hitmonchan is the worst fully-evolved Fighting-type Pokémon. It's entirely outclassed by Primeape, Hitmontop, and Hitmonlee.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Hi Jump Kick
move 2: Return
move 3: Counter / Curse
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bleh, it's Hitmonchan. Really, Counter + Curse can be on the same set if you want. Naturally, Hi Jump Kick is for STAB and your strongest attack. The other two attacks are because Hitmonchan doesn't learn anything better.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hitmonchan learns Rapid Spin, so you can use it for that if you want. Hitmonchan can use DynamicPunch if you <em>must</em> have more power behind your Fighting attack and like the chance to confuse. And you can use the elemental punches as a pure joke, unless you Baton Pass a bunch of Growths to it. You can also use Mach Punch with Curse to make up for the drop in Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hitmonchan's HP is very poor, so it drags down its good Special Defense and passable Defense. Psychic-types resist Hi Jump Kick and hit it super effectively, as do Flying-types; it helps their cause that Hitmonchan doesn't have as much Attack as Hitmonlee. Poison-types with fairly good Defense, such as Weezing and Muk, can chip at Hitmonchan's health quickly. Overall, its defenses are quite lackluster, and therefore many strong attacks will overcome it.</p>
