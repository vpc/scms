[Overview]

<p>Feraligatr isn't horrible—he is good in theory, but with Attack being his best stat and not getting STAB of said best stat, he suffers as such. He can still be used in the normal GSC metagame as something of a SkarmBliss counter. Feraligatr is an OK Pokémon overall, he just can't do much besides physically attack.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Sweeper
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Rock Slide / AncientPower
move 4: Curse / DynamicPunch
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Too bad Feraligatr doesn't get a physical typing. Hydro Pump is on this set because he needs the extra power, and Earthquake can let you hit Electric-types on the switch in. Rock Slide is used because AncientPower's PP and power stink, although you can use it if you feel lucky. The last move is a toss up—Curse to boost that nice Attack stat, or DynamicPunch to take care of Blissey and Snorlax.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Sweeper
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Never use this on a serious team. It's pure comedy, especially coming from that ridiculous 256 Special Attack. However, this set could be effective in UU play.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Iron Tail can be good for a final physical attack with its 100 Base Power. 298 Defense might let Feraligatr do a decent job at phazing, but don't let him take on CurseLax. Submission is an option if you hate DynamicPunch's accuracy.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Zapdos's good Special Defense and reasonable Defense let it take on Feraligatr quite well, while striking back with a STAB Thunderbolt off 125 base Special Attack. Raikou works similarly, except it must beware of Earthquake. Meganium resist Water and Ground attacks, while bludgeoning away with super effective hits. Suicune can Roar Feraligatr away.</p>
