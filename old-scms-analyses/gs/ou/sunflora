[Overview]

<p>Sunflora is UU for a reason. Its low Speed makes it lose against pretty much any Pokemon with a Fire attack, and it doesn't have enough defenses or movepool (like, say, Meganium) to be of any kind of use.</p>

[SET]
name: Growth
move 1: Growth
move 2: Razor Leaf / Giga Drain
move 3: Hidden Power Water / Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Synthesis
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Two words: good luck. This definitely isn't Snorlax, so I don't think you'll do much with Sunflora, but here we go: Growth boosts that already pretty high 308 Special Attack. Razor Leaf can be used instead of Giga Drain for the critical hit rate and PP, but if you want to heal it that badly, use Giga Drain. Pick your Hidden Power of choice and see if you can pull off something nice.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Water is mostly for Fire-types. Hidden Power Fire covers enemy Grass, Bug, and Steel Pokémon. Hidden Power Ice hits those annoying Flying-types, especially Dragonite, in addition to covering Grass Pokemon.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Return
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost / Hidden Power Rock / Hidden Power Ground
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lack of STAB on this set hurts of course, though you can replace one of the physical moves for Razor Leaf so Rhydon doesn't completely wall Sunflora. This is purely a novelty set.</p>

[SET]
name: SunnyBeam
move 1: Growth
move 2: Sunny Day
move 3: SolarBeam
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You'll get smoked by Fire Blast before even pulling off a Growth. Don't expect to win with this set.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can use Synthesis on the Curse or Sunny Day sets. Other than that, there isn't really much else Sunflora can do.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokémon with Fire attacks, Flying Pokémon, Muk, Heracross, and a lot of other stuff beats Sunflora since it's too slow to make an effective impact. Anything with a super effective move against this or a resistance to Grass will pretty much have Sunflora begging for mercy in no time.</p>
