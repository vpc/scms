[Overview]

<p>People always ask why GSC is so stall-oriented, but then they go and use Pokemon like Umbreon. Umbreon's only purpose is to stall, pure and simple, as evidenced by its more popular moves: Charm, Rest, and Toxic. It can be handy against those Curse users that are abound in GSC, but Umbreon's utter lack of usable moves leaves it open to a few gaping holes, namely anything (and I really do mean pretty much anything) with Substitute, Swords Dance, or that has a Fighting or Bug move. Also, an Umbreon with any kind of status affliction is an amazingly easier target to KO, since it either will suffer poison damage every turn and essentially lose its precious Leftovers, or be a sitting duck for two or more free hits from paralysis or sleep. If you're going to use Umbreon, use Charm. There are really not many other uses for it.</p>

[SET]
name: Utility
move 1: Charm
move 2: Pursuit
move 3: Rest
move 4: Toxic
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the more commonly seen set and has a two-pronged use. The first use comes with Charm, and is easy enough: switch into a physical attacker and use Charm to basically nullify its Attack. Umbreon can also use Toxic on whatever may be your opponent since Umbreon has almost zero offensive capability. The second use utilizes Toxic and Pursuit. This is mainly to snipe the prominent Psychic- and Ghost-types, and is certainly hard to handle for Starmie, the most popular Water-type. If Umbreon can hit them with Toxic, they will probably switch to avoid the doubling damage of Toxic. As they switch, use Pursuit to rack up a ton of damage. Use Rest when necessary, especially when Umbreon gets hit with status, because any kind of status affliction spells big trouble for Umbreon.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Charm
move 2: Mean Look
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The one move that makes Umbreon anywhere near useful is Charm, and this is mainly used to trap threats like Curse users, use Charm to nullify their Attack, and use Baton Pass to transfer the trap to an appropriate counter. Rest is used when Umbreon is low on health or when hit with a status affliction. Since Umbreon can take a load of hits (especially with Charm and no special weaknesses), Rest is recommended over Moonlight for the full healing capabilities. Watch out, though, because unless you have a Perish Song utilizer on your team to use in tandem with Umbreon, you could accidentally trap a Curse Snorlax, who will just sit there and try to stall your team out. But hey that's exactly what Umbreon does: stall. Fortunately for Umbreon, Charm has twice the PP of Curse. Also watch out for any phazer since they will shut down this set 100% of the time they aren't sleeping. There are numerous other things that Umbreon can Baton Pass to the rest of the team if you so desire—Substitute, Growth, and Curse are examples.</p>

[SET]
name: Toxic Trapper
move 1: Mean Look
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Confuse Ray / Charm
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>First, use Mean Look to trap one of your opponent's Pokémon of your choosing. Follow up immediately with Toxic to start whittling down your opponent's HP. Both Confuse Ray and Charm work well enough to stall for increased Toxic damage. It's up to personal preference when it comes down to choosing between to the two. You'll most likely see Charm though, as it stops threats like Curse Snorlax from just setting up on Umbreon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Umbreon learns Moonlight, but because of its low PP it hurts its usefulness quite a lot. So using Rest is recommended because Umbreon can take hits easily and survive the downtime. If you opt to Baton Pass Growth or Curse, you can utilize various physical or special attacks as appropriate to hit potential counters. If Charm isn't your thing, Umbreon has access to Reflect that will last five turns.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As mentioned earlier, anything that uses Substitute, Swords Dance, or Belly Drum will have the upper-hand on Umbreon 99% of the time. Tentacruel in particular will get a free turn or two to set up whilst Umbreon does nothing back or is forced to switch. Dark-, Poison-, and Steel-types can absorb everything Umbreon can throw that them with little trouble (though they can't necessarily do too much to Umbreon in return). As far as actual attackers go, anything with Cross Chop will undoubtedly put a dent in Umbreon, as will Heracross and his mighty Megahorn. Another good counter for Umbreon is a status affliction of any kind—Umbreon simply needs to have its Leftovers and be active every turn to retain any of its usefulness. Machamp in particular eats Umbreon alive.</p>
