[Overview]

<p>Dugtrio is cool, but all it has is Speed—and Speed doesn't count for as much as it did in RBY. All of its other stats are lousy.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Substitute / Beat Up
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Come in and use Substitute, then hit Pokémon with the appropriate move. Earthquake has good coverage thanks to STAB. Rock Slide hits Flying-types and Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types and Heracross. Beat Up 2HKOs Blissey with a healthy team, assuming you have an average base Attack stat of a little over 80 (Dugtrio has base 80 Attack, for comparison), but Substitute can be used to ease up prediction when you come in on something like a Raikou or Electabuzz Thunderbolt.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Screech basically ups the power of its attacking moves and could maybe force something to switch in a UU battle. Hidden Power Flying can be used for Heracross and Hidden Power Bug gives extra coverage for Exeggutor.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Suicune, Starmie, Slowbro are just some of the many Water-types that are not weak to Earthquake. Donphan can take anything Dugtrio tries to throw at it and just hit it back with a STAB Earthquake of its own. Forretress can set up Spikes and take little damage with its massive Defense. Skarmory is immune to two of Dugtrio's attacks and isn't weak to the third. Gligar is in the same boat as Skarmory, except it 'only' resists Sludge Bomb.</p>
