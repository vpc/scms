[Overview]

<p>Jumpluff is fast, immune to Earthquake, and gets just about all the support moves one could want. This is a good thing, since its stats don't really enable it to attack. Jumpluff is mainly an in-and-out Pokémon; it switches in to absorb an Earthquake and then uses one of its 4 moves based on the trainer's best judgment. For this reason, Jumpluff requires a fair amount of prediction to be used effectively. When played right, Jumpluff is amazingly useful. When not played right, well... it basically wastes a valuable slot on the team. But then, a majority of the Pokémon available work this way so that's really not much of revolutionary thought.</p>

[SET]
name: Status Support
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Stun Spore
move 3: Leech Seed
move 4: Encore
item: Leftovers / Miracle Berry

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Status and Leech Seed everything in sight. With Spikes, you'll rack up a good amount of damage on multiple switches. If they use Earthquake or Curse, switch in Jumpluff and laugh as you use Encore and make them useless.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Toxic can be used as an alternate status to Stun Spore, and pairs nicely with Leech Seed. Jumpluff can use Protect to prolong damage done by Leech Seed and to regain health even more. Reflect is much of the same, as it lets Jumpluff take more hits as Leech Seed steadily heals it back up.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any status effect really screws up Jumpluff. Paralysis takes its only good stat out of commission, Toxic and burns will take an eventual toll on a Pokémon that relies really only on Leftovers, Leech Seed, and any amount of stalling to stay alive. Ice, Fire, Flying, Rock... all the weaknesses associated with its type. Rock Slide is a pretty popular move that tags along on Earthquake-using Pokémon, so watch out for that when trying to absorb Earthquakes.</p>
