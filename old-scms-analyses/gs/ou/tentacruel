[Overview]

<p>Tentacruel is a great sweeper. Not as much as it used to be since everyone is now trying hard to counter it, but it can still beat down a team late in the game. Poison and Water attacks complement each other very well. Don't forget to think about countering Tentacruel when making a team.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Surf
move 4: Sludge Bomb
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the standard sweeping set for Tentacruel and has been renowned for messing up any kind of team. Substitute is a great protection against Thunder Wave, and the only special attacks that will break a Substitute in one hit are Thunderbolt and Psychic. After stalling any possible counters into using Rest with Sludge Bomb on the switch-ins, set up Swords Dance and take over the battle. It won't be hard to with 298 Speed and both physical and special STAB.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rest can be used if you have a Heal Bell user. Hydro Pump has superior Base Power to Surf, but iffy accuracy. Tentacruel also makes a great Rapid Spin user; the two most popular Spikes users, Cloyster and Forretress, can't do a thing to Tentacruel head-to-head, so watch as your opponent is frustrated when his Spiking technique just doesn't work out! Just remember that Rapid Spin and Swords Dance cannot go on the same moveset.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Zapdos is a pretty sturdy counter. The standard Zapdos has Rest and Sleep Talk, so it can take repeated smacks and RestTalk out Drill Pecks and super effective Thunderbolts. Raikou is also a good counter due to its sturdiness, Speed, and tendency to be a RestTalk user—even without Sleep Talk most have Reflect, which will subdue Tentacruel's Swords Dance attempts. Gengar can also make a decent counter—it's 4x resistant to Sludge Bomb and has a powerful Thunderbolt—just don't let it take too many Surfs or Hydro Pumps. Surprisingly, some of the best Tentacruel counters are in UU. Quagsire is an awesome counter—it's not weak to Surf, has a STAB Earthquake, and is resistant to Sludge Bomb. Qwilfish is awesome too. It has the same typing as Tentacruel and can set up Curse, nullifying Tentacruel's Swords Dance attempts while putting Qwilfish in the advantage with boosted Defense and Attack. Muk is also good with its high Special Defense, HP, resistance to Sludge Bomb, and tendency to carry Curse.</p>
