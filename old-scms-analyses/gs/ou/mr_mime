[Overview]

<p>A good UU Psychic-type if you're good at predicting, because quite frankly Hypno has been done to death in UU teams as a special attack absorber. Mr. Mime learns decent moves (Encore in particular) and has good special stats. Keep it away from any physical hits, though, since Mr. Mime can't take a physical hit for anything.</p>

[SET]
name: Encore Support
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Encore
move 4: Light Screen / Hypnosis
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If they're going to use Curse, send in Mr. Mime, Encore the Curses, and attack, set up a screen, or status them with Hypnosis.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect can also be passed around the team, but Light Screen is a generally rare move to have. Mr. Mime also learns Ice Punch and Fire Punch if Thunderbolt isn't your cup of tea. With Light Screen, Mr. Mime can also pull off Rest against most special attackers. You can Counter back a weaker physical attack for a KO. Mr. Mime learns Barrier and Baton Pass, but that's pretty mediocre. You can use Thunder Wave, but it's not that good with Encore, as a fully paralyzed Pokémon can cause Encore to fail at a crucial moment.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dark-, Steel-, and fellow Psychic-types tend to win against Mr. Mime as long as they aren't weak to Thunderbolt. This population includes Exeggutor, Umbreon, Houndoom, Hypno, Espeon, and Scizor. The typical Snorlax and Blissey also work, as well as Raikou and to some extent Jynx. Don't be fazed by its base 120 Special Defense; it isn't worth much when considered alongside its awful base 40 HP. Anything with strong physical attacks will also spell doom.</p>
