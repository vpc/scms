[Overview]

<p>Kabutops is a very much overlooked, albeit decent Pokémon. The Rock typing really helps Kabutops switch into Returns, and Kabutops is faster than all of the GSC walls. However, not having Rock Slide or Earthquake <strong>really</strong> hurts.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: AncientPower
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Bug
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Swords Dance and then wail away. AncientPower gets STAB and carries the chance to boost all of Kabutops's stats. Hydro Pump is mostly for Skarmory, but it also covers Steelix, Rhydon, Golem, and Forretress. The last move is your choice: Hidden Power Ground nails Electric-types, and Hidden Power Bug covers Exeggutor.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Kabutops can Rapid Spin for all it's worth. If you're playing a UU team, you could surprise Quagsire (common in many UU teams) with Giga Drain. You could also use Hidden Power Rock over AncientPower for more PP and power. You could also use Hidden Power Flying to hit all Grass-type Pokémon. It would also help cover Heracross, Machamp, and any other Fighting-types you may encounter.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grass-types exploit Kabutops's greatest weakness and don't fear Hydro Pump, especially those that don't particularly care about Hidden Power Bug either, such as Venusaur and Meganium. Electric-types also pile on Kabutops's relatively weak Special Defense. Sturdy Water-types like Slowbro and Quagsire strangle Kabutops with Surf or Earthquake. Lastly, Muk can take quite a few attacks from it and deal massive damage back with Giga Drain.</p>
