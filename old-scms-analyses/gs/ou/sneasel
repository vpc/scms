[Overview]

<p>Sneasel is cool. Too bad his bad typing, bad defenses, bad Special Attack, and horrid movepool cripple him so badly. He would be better if he got Swords Dance, like he does in RSE, but he still wouldn't be anywhere near standard. Sneasel is purely a "fun team/UU team" kind of Pokémon.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: DynamicPunch / Hidden Power Fighting
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Return
move 4: Reflect
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This may be all Sneasel can pull together, though he'll probably be OHKOed before doing something useful. Use Hidden Power Fighting if you want Sneasel to live long enough to hit something, and the other 2 moves are just because Sneasel can't do anything with his STAB. Reflect might let Sneasel live a bit longer than he should.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter is an option, but good luck using it—though if Sneasel survives, the opponent won't. Thief is always nice, Iron Tail is an option because it can beat Rock-types, Moonlight is purely for comedy reasons, and Psych Up might let Sneasel copy some stat-ups. Screech can be used because it can help Sneasel beat up things, though if your opponent leaves a Screeched Pokémon in against Sneasel, he probably deserves to get beaten by it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Sneasel is extremely frail, so most attacks will usually make him keel over—especially super effective moves. Sneasel also suffers from lack of a STAB move, which makes his attacks weak compared to those of other Pokémon. Therefore, Pokémon that are not weak to any of his attacks, and can exploit one of his weaknesses (particularly physical attackers), are good counters—Fighting-, Rock-, and Fire-types work excellently. Physical walls will also work pretty well.</p>
