[Overview]

<p>Muk isn't exactly a very easy Pokémon to use since many common threats in the metagame counter him with relative ease, in addition to the fact that he can be pretty predictable. However, Muk has some good stats in his favor (notably HP, Attack, and Special Defense, similar to Snorlax), which gives him more chances to switch in and try to hurt something. And if nothing else, he learns Explosion, which will undoubtedly kill something. Just watch out for Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types when you're Exploding!</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Explosion
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Curse / Giga Drain
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Fire Blast is there for all of those Steel Pokémon that will be coming in because Sludge Bomb and Explosion won't touch them. If you ever dispose of the Steel, Rock, and Poison Pokémon, you can Curse up and do as much damage as possible, then Explode. Giga Drain is for Rhydon and Golem.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There's Rest if you like it, and if you really want to, you can use Mean Look if you think you can trap something and Explode on it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pretty much every physical type Pokémon is a counter to Muk. His best use is just to try and surprise something with Fire Blast or Giga Drain and then kill something with Explosion.</p>
