[Overview]

<p>Qwilfish has a few qualities that make it unique from its Water / Poison cousin Tentacruel, namely the ability to set up Spikes, in addition to having a nice Attack stat, which means even without Curse it can leave a nice dent with Sludge Bomb. Though it isn't very sturdy, its typing grants it resistance to Water and Bug attacks; paired with its immunity to Toxic, Qwilfish can switch into most Spikes users and spinners with relative ease. It's an awesome UU Pokémon, and if used right can be a real surprise thorn (pun sort of intended) in your opponent's side.</p>

[SET]
name: Spikes
move 1: Curse
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Spikes
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lay down those Spikes first—it's Qwilfish's biggest asset. Don't use Curse right away, as they'll send in an easy counter and you'll have wasted a turn. Predict what the counter will be and hit with the attack you think will do more damage. If that counter uses Rest or gets poisoned, then is your chance to set up Curse and perhaps take out a couple more of the opponent's Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Qwilfish does not have too many other options. One could opt for Toxic instead of Curse, but Qwilfish's attacks cover both physical and special types, and Sludge Bomb has that nice 30% poison chance already. Haze could be useful conditionally in a strictly-UU environment for threats such as Growth Vaporeon, but otherwise you're better off with Curse.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best counter to Qwilfish (in regards to Spikes as well) is Starmie, since it can both Rapid Spin away the Spikes and possibly KO Qwilfish with Psychic or Thunderbolt; however, Qwilfish can wear down Starmie with a few lucky poisons if the opponent guesses right. Any Electric- or Psychic-type can also get rid of Qwilfish with ease (though with their typically-low Defense, they'll take a nice hit from Sludge Bomb). Qwilfish can't really take many hits—it's more of a hit-and-run Pokémon.</p>
