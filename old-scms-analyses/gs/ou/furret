[Overview]

<p>Well, Furret's very fragile, but can sweep when set up properly. Its HP, Speed, and Attack are passable. Too bad Curse is the only move it can learn to raise its Attack, which makes us basically throw away its Speed. It's mostly based on luck and the good will of the opponent. Mint Berry + Rest is good for one try, but otherwise pick Leftovers. Its HP is also fairly decent, but doesn't help it too much.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Double-Edge
move 2: Rest
move 3: Curse
move 4: Shadow Ball
item: Leftovers / Mint Berry

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Start setting up and Rest when you get low on health. Though it's unlikely Furret will survive through the setup, if it does, you can start sweeping with Double-Edge and/or Shadow Ball.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Endure + Reversal might work if you have it powered up by some Curses. It could be easier to do if you have a Pokémon with Light Screen or Reflect. DynamicPunch can OHKO Blissey after a couple of Curses. Amnesia can be used if you want Furret to last a while. It doesn't have enough staying power, though. Iron Tail is not that bad at all, but it has 75% accuracy and there are plenty of Pokémon who resist Steel attacks. Return is for people who don't want the recoil damage and prefer lower powered attacks. Thief can be used to steal something's Leftovers, though Furret will die afterwards.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that can hit fast and hard—it doesn't really matter if it's special or physical.</p>
