[Overview]

<p>Charizard is a good counter (if you want to call it that) for the standard "SkarmBliss" teams. Before you just randomly bust out Charizard and let it get owned, you need to have some things on your team for it to work: dependable Water-type counters, paralysis support, and dual screens never hurt. Charizard can be a good Pokémon given the right circumstances. Although it has many weaknesses and not-so-great stats, you just can't resist this fiery dragon.</p>

[SET]
name: BellyZard (Belly Drum)
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Rock Slide
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It's pretty simple here. If you have a chance, Belly Drum, and then laugh as your opponent gets swept. Charizard is the fastest available Belly Drum user.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A somewhat decent option is Swords Dance if you need to switch out without losing 50% of your HP. It's a little tougher to use, and won't be as game-breaking. Wing Attack is an option for STAB, but since Fire moves hit Grass-types and Heracross quite hard already, you'll usually find the moves listed to be good enough.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Starmie, Suicune, Slowbro, Aerodactyl, Zapdos somewhat, Raikou, Jolteon, or basically anything faster than Charizard with a super effective move will beat it. Anything really defensive with a super effective move will prevent a Charizard sweep, but many of those fail if they are paralyzed, or in the case of Raikou in particular, have used Rest and fail to select their super effective STAB move. Another way to handle Charizard is to just continually pound on it—after a few hits, it might not be able to Belly Drum, taking away its biggest threat.</p>
