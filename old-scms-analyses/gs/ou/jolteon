[Overview]

<p>Jolteon is very fragile, but very good if you use it effectively. Speed is Jolteon's advantage, so do not get it paralyzed unless you KNOW you can Heal Bell in time to use it again. Make sure you have multiple options to Baton Pass out to. Baton Pass can be a devil in GSC on things that are able to pull it off, so exploit it as much as you can.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is one half of the second most popular "combo" in GSC history (of course, the other being SkarmBliss). Jolteon is one of the few Pokémon in GSC that can pull off Baton Pass due to its ability to take down the three major phazers, Suicune, Rhydon, and Skarmory. Agility could help set up something to sweep big time, like Marowak or Charizard. Although, Substitute has become popular as well, especially on teams that don't utilize Heal Bell, because Substitute blocks status. Hidden Power Water is generally superior to Hidden Power Ice in this instance because there are no Grass-type phazers and Hidden Power Water hits Steelix, Rhydon, and Golem super hard.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Growth is also an option that can be Baton Passed. Reflect and Charm can be used on switch-ins. If you don't like Grass-types, you can use Hidden Power Ice. Thunder Wave is always an option as well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The generic special walls of Blissey and Snorlax take on Jolteon with ease, as do Electric Pokémon like Raikou and Ampharos; they all take little from Jolteon's main form of offense, Thunderbolt. Exeggutor and Meganium resist both Electric and Water, and don't even particularly care for Jolteon's likely target for Baton Passing, Marowak. Muk's good Special Defense and HP help it wear Jolteon down. If Hidden Power is absent, Rhydon, Golem, and Steelix run Jolteon over with Earthquake.</p>
