[Overview]

<p>Hitmontop has higher Defense when compared to Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan—pity it doesn't learn any useful moves. It's strictly a UU Fighting-type, since Primeape, and even Poliwrath, are better.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Hi Jump Kick
move 2: Curse / Rest
move 3: Counter / Return
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Look familiar? Hitmontop is played much like Hitmonchan, but better. Counter is a more likely route given that Hitmontop has better Defense. Curse can work nicely because its Special Defense is very high for a Fighting-type.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hitmontop can use Rapid Spin if you really need it that badly. But other than that, there's no good or useful alternative option for it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Poison and Flying Pokémon resist Hi Jump Kick and aren't overly damaged by Hidden Power Ghost, so they can gradually wear Hitmontop down. Psychic-types kill Hitmontop much faster, but generally are hit decently hard in return by Hidden Power Ghost. Pokémon with a reasonable degree of physical durability will trump Hitmontop, as its attacks aren't particularly powerful. Very strong physical attackers will also work.</p>
