[Overview]

<p>Togetic sounds good in theory, but it lacks the proper moves to do what its stats lend it to do: tank. If it had some more defensive moves, it'd probably be pretty hard to face.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Charm / Encore
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Safeguard
move 4: Psychic
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In theory, Togetic isn't bad, because it has nice stats. However, its movepool tells a different story. Tanking stats (except for HP), but no tank moves. Charm can be good against all the Curse users running around, or Encore can be used so an appropriate counter can come in. Fire Blast is on the set because it's really the best attack Togetic learns, Safeguard can help your team, and Psychic is in the last slot because it lacks anything better.</p>

<p>No STAB, but it's an option and can be fun to use.</p>

move 1: Curse
move 2: Hidden Power Flying
move 3: Return
move 4: Rest

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Aside from that 313 HP, a Curse set isn't out of question, considering Togetic's other stats. Needs a lot of Curses under its belt before its Attack stat is high enough to do something, though.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sweet Kiss can be used because Togetic can't really attack well so you might as well make your enemy hit himself. Togetic has access to Zap Cannon if you want to paralyze stuff. Mirror Move could be fun because Togetic might get something cool like Spikes or Reflect. Psych Up + Charm can be fun against stat-uppers (copying their stats, then lowering them). Finally, Shadow Ball can go on the Curse moveset if you're scared of Gengar.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mostly physical attackers (especially Rock Pokémon) and STAB Electric and Ice attacks.</p>
