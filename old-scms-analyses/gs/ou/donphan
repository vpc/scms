[Overview]

<p>Donphan is a no-frills sort of Pokémon. It used to be very popular early on in the metagame, but over time, people preferred Normal-type resistances for a physical wall, or Marowak for its Ground-type. You pretty much will always know what it's going to do, but it's good at what it does. Donphan is actually a pretty unique Pokémon in that it has bulky physical stats (Attack, Defense, and HP) but remains a pure Ground-type, which is both a pro and a con. It has no real gaping 4x weaknesses, but it lacks certain resistances (notably the resistance to Normal-type attacks), and thus it isn't seen more than, say, Steelix or Rhydon. Also, while its Attack is great, most people looking for a pure Ground-type attacker will usually opt for the Thick Club and Swords Dance potential of Marowak. Nevertheless, Donphan is a very solid tank with both good Attack and Defense, and it won't let you down.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Hidden Power Rock / Body Slam
move 3: Curse
move 4: Rest / Roar
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Rock vs. Body Slam is a choice of hitting Flying-types vs. hitting Grass-types and the chance for paralysis. Roar prevents enemy phazers like Skarmory from ruining the fun, but Rest lets you live longer. Donphan isn't dying to physical attacks any time soon.</p>

[SET]
name: Utility
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Roar
move 3: Rapid Spin
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Roar away various fiends and take a hit with that good Defense. Rapid Spin takes care of Spikes, and Earthquake will hit hard from that great Attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Donphan does learn Rapid Spin, and it can wall Forretress well. However, Donphan is in a bind if it's Cloyster laying the Spikes. As silly as it may sound, Growl will really annoy a lot of those Curse users to the point where they can get stalled out. As for all other sturdy Pokémon, Toxic can be a good idea.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Donphan has relatively poor Special Defense, so Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks deal a lot of damage to it. In fact, most strong special attacks in general will put a dent in Donphan. Exeggutor's good Defense and Ground-type resistance helps it switch in easily, and most Water-types can shake off Earthquake as well. The utility set is countered by anything that is immune to Earthquake.</p>
