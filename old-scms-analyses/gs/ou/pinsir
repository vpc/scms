[Overview]

<p>Game Freak hates Pinsir, sadly. I don't know why, but they must for shafting his GSC potential the way they did. Nevertheless, in the hands of the elite, Pinsir is one awesome sweeper, in contention for the best UU sweeper for sure. The physical attacks he learns covers most of the common Pokémon, and he's decently fast in GSC terms. If you can get rid of Ghost- and Flying-types, use him. He's also one of the coolest Pokémon for sure.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Body Slam
move 3: Submission
move 4: Hidden Power Bug
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Try to bring Pinsir in on something that's sleeping because Pinsir is rather fragile. After a Swords Dance, this set will hurt any Pokémon that's not named Skarmory.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Body Slam / Hidden Power Bug
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is good for teams that don't seem to have a dominant attacker (Toxic stall teams, for instance).</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can use Hidden Power Rock, Return, or Substitute as a filler move. If OHKO moves are allowed, Guillotine is an option.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Skarmory is the best Pinsir counter in the game obviously, Gengar and Misdreavus resist all of this guy's moves. Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno, Charizard, Aerodactyl, and Muk all resist most of Pinsir's moves as well. Steelix can work well against the RestTalk set.</p>
