[Overview]

<p>Fearow is a decent UU Pokémon, but it just has too shallow of a movepool to be overly useful. ADV did Fearow a bit of a favor by giving it Choice Band to boost that decent attack it has, but in GSC, there's no reliable way to get that kind of offensive boost to Fearow without hurting its usefulness. Another thing that hurts its usefulness is the presence of Dodrio, which outclasses Fearow anyway.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + 3 Attacks
move 1: Drill Peck
move 2: Return / Tri Attack
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Fighting
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It's pretty basic here. Predict correctly and get a Substitute in, and then attack appropriately. Skarmory owns this, but Fearow can't expect to beat it anyway. Use Return for pure power or Tri Attack for the chance to hax the opponent (if you're lucky like that). The Hidden Power lets it hit Rocks and Steels.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Double-Edge
move 4: Drill Peck / Hidden Power Ground
item: Leftovers / Mint Berry

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rest and Sleep Talk keep Fearow alive after it takes recoil damage from Double-Edge. Drill Peck is there to mostly hit Ghosts, but it also gives a nice second STAB for stuff that it hits super effective. You could use Hidden Power Ground in that last slot for Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Fearow can use Mirror Move to send back Earthquake to something random like Nidoking or Golem (after switching in on it, of course) which is funny as hell. Pursuit could be good for a laugh on something with low HP that tries to switch if it can't beat Fearow. You can try out Curse to boost your stats, but then you lose your major strength: Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rock- and Steel-types with high Defense wall Fearow indefinitely, even if it has Steel Wing or Hidden Power Fighting. Electric Pokémon in general switch in easily on Drill Peck and hit Fearow super effectively, as do sturdy Water-types carrying Ice Beam. Curse users will usually win against Fearow provided they don't suffer a critical hit. Gengar isn't a fan of getting hit by Drill Peck, but is immune to Return and has Thunderbolt.</p>
