[Overview]

<p>GSC is a stalling environment, a lot of people will agree with that. With Wobbuffet's stats and moves, you'd think that it'd be a great tank to use on a stall team. However, Wobbuffet doesn't learn any healing moves. So the only way it can recover HP is if Wobbuffet is passed to a Pokémon who is under the effects of Leech Seed. Even then, that Pokémon has to be trapped by Mean Look or Spider Web. If your opponent's Pokémon is not trapped, then Wobbuffet's major flaw kicks in. As long as your opponent has two Pokémon, he or she can continually switch them out between each other. This stalls, yes, but it renders Wobbuffet useless. This applies especially if Wobbuffet is your last Pokémon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wobbuffet in GSC is rather limited. As a matter of fact, the moves in the moveset listed above are the only moves it learns. However, that doesn't mean that Wobbuffet is useless. The moves it learns match perfectly with its stats. Wobbuffet has a ridiculous amount of HP, and the defensive stats compliment the use of Counter and Mirror Coat. This means that Wobbuffet will take enough damage to more than likely KO one of your opponent's Pokémon from it using a move. Safeguard is always good to use, and it helps Wobbuffet as it doesn't like being hit with status. Though Wobbuffet's Counter-style purpose works based on its stats, it may backfire too. So, Destiny Bond is there in case you realize that Wobbuffet has no chance of surviving its next attack.</p>

<p>Don't use Mimic.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dark-types, Curse users, Explosion, sleep moves, Toxic, Leech Seed, Shadow Ball Gengar and Misdreavus, Spikes, and smart opponents all beat Wobbuffet handedly. You have to be very careful when using Wobbuffet, because its defenses aren't that good. If you use Counter when your opponent uses a special attack or vice versa, then Wobbuffet's doomed.</p>
