[Overview]

<p>Typhlosion is decently fast and can hit pretty hard with Fire Blast. Predicting switches can really help it out, so be smart when using it. It is quite possibly the best UU Pokémon when it's not banished to BL.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Sweeper
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: ThunderPunch
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass / Rest
item: Leftovers / Miracle Berry
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Fire Blast works off of Typhlosion's great Special Attack and STAB. ThunderPunch is a good backup special attack and can nail Water-types on the switch. Earthquake can smack stuff like Rhydon, enemy Typhlosion, and Tyranitar, and makes Typhlosion a good mixed sweeper. It also prevents it from being walled by Blissey. The last slot is up to personal preference. Hidden Power Ice can ruin Dragonite, Hidden Power Grass covers Quagsire, and hits Rhydon and Golem harder than Earthquake, and Rest is good if you have a Heal Bell user on your team to make Typhlosion more than just a one time threat. Miracle Berry works if you don't have a cleric and still want to use Rest, or to take random status inflictions that could cripple Typhlosion.</p>

move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: ThunderPunch / Earthquake
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Typhlosion makes a good RestTalk user, either mixed or fully special. Not much to say, easily walled though.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can use Hidden Power Water to still hit Golem and Rhydon, and it gives Typhlosion an attack to hit enemy Fire-types with if you don't want to use Earthquake. It leaves Typhlosion with better HP (which more than makes up for the minor drop in Defense) than Hidden Power Grass does, but doesn't hit Quagsire on the 4x weakness. On the physical side, DynamicPunch is not bad at all if you don't mind the accuracy. It's awesome for Blissey or Snorlax, and Typhlosion has enough Attack to use it.</p>

<p>Curse is not recommended, but can be done if you want to use a more physical moveset, though it usually won't work. Typhlosion can use Roar if you're really desperate for some kind of phazer.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Quagsire's Electric immunity lets it switch in on anything Typhlosion can toss at it (barring the rare Hidden Power Grass) and Quagsire can strike back with STAB Earthquake. Dragonite is another counter if Typhlosion isn't carrying Hidden Power Ice. Rhydon and Golem don't particularly mind Earthquake, and resist Fire Blast and are immune to ThunderPunch, but they take big damage from Hidden Power Ice and even more from Hidden Power Grass (and Hidden Power Water). Dugtrio can switch in on ThunderPunch, outrun Typhlosion, and 2HKO with Earthquake. In OU, Snorlax can take anything except DynamicPunch and set up Curse to sweep.</p>
