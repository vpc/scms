[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You'll have to go with Surf because Hydro Pump is illegal with Belly Drum. Return, Surf, and Hidden Power Ghost hit everything at least neutrally, and Belly Drum turns Azumarill's mediocre 198 Attack into an almost-impressive 776. Double-Edge is an option over Return to hit stuff harder; Azumarill has enough HP, so it won't be as bad as you may think.</p>

[Opinion]

<p>Azumarill is a tanking Pokémon with promising stats, but no real tanking moves. It could have been a decent Belly Drummer / Curser had it better offensive stats and physical moves.</p>
