<p>This works a little differently than the other trapping set. More than likely, a pseudo-hazer is going to switch in to Ariados, so Spider Web them. Then, Protect as they Roar or Whirlwind. Now, they'll probably Whirlwind again, so use Disable! If successful, the Pokémon won't be able to pseudo-haze you away, leaving you free to Baton Pass out to the appropriate counter. Smeargle does this a lot better, however, since Ariados is so very slow and has various weaknesses.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you're intent on using Ariados to attack, this is probably your best bet. Screech on whatever switches in, then attack with whatever will do the most damage. Quite honestly, the last move can be whatever you want it to be; it could be fun for Ariados to take an opponent's item to the grave.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You could try out Giga Drain for Rock / Ground-types, but unless it's a 4x weakness it won't do too much.</p>

[Opinion]

<p>Ariados is just not that great of a Pokémon. The Bug / Poison thing has been done a million times, and even though it gets a cool and potentially useful novelty move, it is really slow, doesn't hit hard, and has common weaknesses.</p>
