[Overview]

<p>Kricketot is outclassed in every way as a pure Bug-type by both Shelmet and Karrablast. With below-average Attack, pathetic Speed, and only nine moves to work with, Kricketot is almost always a liability. However, it can run an effective mixed set. </p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Bug Bite
move 2: Mud-Slap
move 3: Endeavor / Uproar
move 4: Struggle Bug

ivs: 6 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Kricketot's only viable set. With the given IVs it hits 19 HP, which is regarded as the "magic" Life Orb number. Bug Bite is Kricketot's primary STAB, and can be useful for stealing berries from Pokemon such as Munchlax and Dwebble. Mud-Slap hits Aron and Magnemite hard and lowers the opponent's accuracy. Endeavor can be used to weaken a Pokemon enough so that it can be revenge killed easier, and works nicely with Life Orb. However, Uproar is Kricketot's strongest attack, possibly defeating Flying-types who would otherwise wall this set. Struggle Bug is mostly filler, but can force switches or help control special attackers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Kricketot really benefits from entry hazards, notably Stealth Rock, being off the field, so a Rapid Spin user will be useful. Kabuto is the best at this job, resisting all of Kricketot’s weaknesses. Flash Fire Pokemon are also good partners for Kricketot, as they can potentially gain a free boost as they switch in. Aron is another Pokemon that pairs well with Kricketot as it possesses a 4x resistance to Flying and Rock.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With a movepool consisting of only nine moves, Kricketot doesn't have many other options. It can use Growl and String Shot in tandem with Struggle Bug to force switches, or to weaken a Pokemon enough for a teammate to sweep. Snore can be used to absorb sleep and still attack, but Uproar is the better option. Bide will just make it setup fodder for Pokemon such as Scraggy.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gastly is the best check for Kricketot, as it either resists or is immune to whatever Kricketot has, and can hit back with strong STAB attacks. Aron also counters it thoroughly, but must watch out for Mud-Slap. Dwebble and Ferroseed can switch in on any attack Kricketot carries and proceed to set up hazards, thereby reducing Kricketot's lifespan exponentially.</p>
