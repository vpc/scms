[Overview]

<p>Due to its terrible stats, Sentret is one of the worst Pokemon to use in Little Cup. Its only advantage is that it has an incredible movepool, including the rare Hyper Voice, so it is one of the few Normal-types with a good special STAB move. However, due to its low Special Attack, Sentret is even outclassed by the likes of Minccino, Whismur, and Aipom. Sentret can also use Trick to cripple a Pokemon, but even so, Sentret isn't a Pokemon that should ever be considered for a Little Cup team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature could be used for the extra Speed, but the power is usually better on Sentret. A Life Orb is also viable if a fourth attack is used, as it allows Sentret to switch moves. It does lose a bit of power compared to Choice Specs, however.</p>

<p>Any potential check to Sentret has to worry about Trick, but some Pokemon deal with holding Choice Specs better than others. Gastly can switch in on any move other than Shadow Ball and doesn't even mind ending up with Choice Specs. Stunky is a good teammate for Sentret, as it can trap and KO Gastly. Scraggy and Mienfoo check Sentret with their Fighting-type moves if they avoid Trick. Therefore, Timburr makes for a good teammate, as it checks Scraggy, while Duskull works well against Mienfoo. Dwebble can set up on Sentret that lack Surf, so Staryu is a good teammate, as it can hit Dwebble hard and use Rapid Spin to get rid of any entry hazards that Dwebble manages to set up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sentret's Attack stat is actually higher than its Special Attack, but there are many better physical attackers than Sentret. It does learn an amazing amount of physical moves, such as STAB moves, as well as Brick Break, Shadow Claw, Pursuit, ThunderPunch, Fire Punch, U-turn, Ice Punch, and Aqua Tail. Super Fang does good damage to healthy Pokemon, though it only shines against bulkier opponents. Substitute can be used with Sucker Punch and Focus Punch to ease prediction, though it is unreliable, and Sentret will rarely force a switch to be able to get an opportunity to set up Substitute. Sentret learns Baton Pass and can pass moves such as Amnesia, Defense Curl, Work Up, and Hone Claws, though other Pokemon are far more reliable for that role. Quick Attack is a priority move, but it is incredibly weak. Sentret also learns Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, which can be considered on the Choice Specs set, but they get much lesser coverage compared to the listed moves. A set with Endure and Reversal is an option as well, but it won't do enough damage to be worth using. Charm could weaken a physical attacker, though Sentret usually loses to those even with the move. Finally, Knock Off is always a good move in Little Cup and is worth using instead of Trick if Sentret isn't using a Choice item.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gastly can switch in on anything except Ghost- and Dark-type moves and can deal major damage to Sentret with Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Fighting. Scraggy, Mienfoo, and Timburr will KO Sentret with their STAB moves, but have trouble when Tricked a Choice Specs. Dwebble works well against sets that lack Water-type moves and can set up multiple hazards to hurt Sentret's team. Munchlax is a good choice against special attacking sets, but Trick can give it problems.</p>
