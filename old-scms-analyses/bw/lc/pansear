[Overview]

<p>Pansear is one of the 5th generation's monkey trio. Unfortunately, the trio has some serious problems with being outclassed by other Pokemon in Little Cup on top of having rather lackluster movepools, but all is not lost! Each has a niche that they can act in to good success. With good Speed and acceptable offensive stats, Pansear has the potential to fill a worthwhile spot on your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The premise of this set is simple; come in on a Pokemon Pansear can force out, set up a Nasty Plot, and attempt to sweep. Fire Blast is an insanely powerful STAB attack, while Hidden Power Electric will eliminate the bulky Water-types that may attempt to prevent a sweep. Taunt allows Pansear to disable any attempts for the opponent to use a support move, which may aid Pansear in setting up or prevent it from being crippled by status. A Life Orb enhances the damage output and allows the chances of a sweep being pulled off to greatly improve. Alternatively, Pansear can use Sunny Day to give itself a big boost in Fire Blast without Nasty Plot, while giving it access to single turn SolarBeam and a reduced Water-type weakness. Hidden Power Ground would then be the superior choice over Hidden Power Electric as it rounds out the coverage with Fire Blast and SolarBeam.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast if you don't want to risk a miss. Chinchou beats Pansear sets that lack Hidden Power Ground or SolarBeam, so a teammate such as Ferroseed should be considered to check it. Ferroseed also has the bonus of being a good answer to Wooper, which can also trouble Pansear without SolarBeam. Diglett outspeeds Pansear, traps it, and OHKOes it with Earthquake, so a Choice Scarf Snover can be used to check it. Lastly, Pansear is somewhat weak to priority moves, which are common on Fighting-type Pokemon, so a Ghost-type Pokemon such as Frillish or Duskull can prove quite useful.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Choice Specs set utilizing Overheat can be effective, but this is better left to Houndour. A physical set utilizing Hone Claws could be pulled off with decent offensive choices such as Crunch and Fire Punch, but is hard to use and is generally outclassed by other sweepers that are available. Flame Charge can be a decent move to try, as Pansear will hit a Speed stat of 24 after the boost, meaning that it is more difficult to revenge kill. Pansear also has access to a variety of support moves such as Will-O-Wisp, but is too frail to make much use out of the majority of them. Eviolite will help Pansear differentiate from Houndour by making use of it's slightly greater bulk, but this is often not a good option, due to Pansear's bad defensive typing.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Water-types that are immune to Electric-type attacks, such as Chinchou and Wooper, are good checks as long as Pansear lacks SolarBeam, while Mantyke is good against Pansear that choose against using Hidden Power Electric. Diglett has higher Speed than Pansear and carries Earthquake, which gets a clean OHKO. Finally, hitting Pansear with priority moves will wear it down quickly enough due to Life Orb recoil and Pansear's low defenses.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Pansear receives Blaze from the Dream World. Pansear easily gets low on HP, meaning that Blaze can come into effect quite often. It is the superior choice to Gluttony in most situations; however, Gluttony itself gets a boost from the Dream World, as it activates pinch Berries (that come from the Dream World) such as Salac Berry earlier.</p>
