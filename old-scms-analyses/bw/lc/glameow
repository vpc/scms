[Overview]

<p>Glameow is one of the few Pokemon that can make for a good dedicated lead, thanks to its access to great moves such as Fake Out and U-turn along with a very good Speed stat. However, Meowth almost completely outclasses it with its better Attack stat and mostly wider movepool, forcing Glameow to find small ways to differentiate itself, mainly in the form of Sucker Punch and Quick Attack. Glameow can try to sweep with Work Up as well, which allows it to use Hidden Power to hit threats that can tank its physical movepool. Overall, Glameow is very outclassed but still a decent Pokemon in its own right, and can make for a solid member on most LC teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Fake Out and U-turn are good ways for Glameow to deal quick damage with minimal risk, making it a good lead. Sucker Punch is very important for Glameow as well, as it is a priority move that hits Ghost-types, i.e. something that Meowth doesn't have. Hypnosis is the main choice for the fourth moveslot due to the high potency of sleep. If the low accuracy is a turn-off, then Return could be used as a powerful STAB move. Quick Attack can be used for added priority.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Duskull and Frillish can all burn Glameow and use their non-attacking moves to stall out Sucker Punch's PP. Shed Skin Scraggy can set up on these threats, so it is a good teammate for Glameow. Timburr and Mienfoo can use their Fighting-type attacks to easily KO Glameow. Duskull does a fantastic job of checking these Fighting-types, so it is a suitably fantastic teammate. Magnemite is a good teammate for Glameow as well, as it can trap and KO Ferroseed, which easily walls this set.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Work Up is a decent way for Glameow to take advantage of its high Speed, giving it a way to boost its offenses enough to attempt a sweep. Return has good neutral coverage and is a powerful STAB move. Sucker Punch is a good priority move and hits Ghost-types that are immune to Return. Hidden Power Fire is in the last slot, mainly to hit Ferroseed as well as other Steel-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ghost-types with non-attacking moves such as Duskull are a problem again, and Stunky is especially useful here as getting rid of said Ghost-types with Pursuit can open up a path for Glameow to sweep. Bulky Fighting-types can tank a Return and use Drain Punch to both KO and heal back a lot of their lost HP. Duskull and Frillish make good teammates for Glameow for their ability to handle Fighting-types. Any Pokemon that lacks a weakness to Sucker Punch that holds a Choice Scarf, such as Chinchou and Snover, can revenge kill Glameow as well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hone Claws can boost Glameow's Attack, but losing the ability to run Hidden Power effectively makes this an inferior option. Shadow Claw is a reliable move to hit Ghosts, but Meowth uses the move better. Taunt and Substitute can force the opponent to attack Glameow, easing prediction on Sucker Punch. Snatch can be fun against an opponent trying to set up a Substitute, but it is quite unreliable. Charm and Toxic are using on a stalling set, but Glameow should really just be attacking due to its low defenses. Wake-Up Slap could be used to hit Steel-types on a purely physical set, as can the very unreliable Dig, but Glameow has an easier time sweeping by going mixed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>All checks to Glameow need to watch out for Hypnosis, but when Sleep Clause is activated, Glameow isn't that hard to deal with. Ghost-types, especially those with Will-O-Wisp, can take anything but a Sucker Punch. Fighting-types can tank a hit and KO with their Fighting-type moves, making them solid checks to Glameow. Choice Scarf users and faster Pokemon such as Elekid can revenge kill Glameow due to its frailty. Lastly, Ferroseed walls any set lacking Hidden Power Fire or Wake-Up Slap, usually opting to set up Spikes or Leech Seed on the switch-in.<p>
