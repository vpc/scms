[Overview]

<p>Having a somewhat large movepool and access to moves like Fake Out and Sucker Punch, Skitty can make for a great lead in many situations. Her ability, Normalize, is very useful in some cases as it gives STAB boosts to all of Skitty's moves by changing their typing to Normal. However, Skitty faces some problems this generation. Superior Fake Out leads such as Mienfoo and Meowth outclass Skitty with their better stats and abilities. The increase in Fighting-type priority, namely Mach Punch, makes it very hard for Skitty to keep up with the opposing team, but despite these downfalls, Skitty can be a major player.<p>

[SET]
name: Anti-Lead
move 1: Fake Out
move 2: Return
move 3: Sucker Punch / Faint Attack
move 4: Zen Headbutt
item: Life Orb
ability: Cute Charm
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 236 Atk / 76 SpD / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With two priority moves in Fake Out and Sucker Punch, Skitty easily becomes an effective lead in Little Cup. Zen Headbutt is used for super effective damage against Fighting-types. With Fake Out easily luring in Ghost-types, Sucker Punch can be used to surprise them, often OHKOing them. However, be aware that most Ghost-types have access to Substitute and Will-O-Wisp, two moves that will allow them to easily handle Skitty. Faint Attack can be used over Sucker Punch to hit Ghost-types like Gastly, as they can use Substitute to get around Skitty.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is essential on this set; without it, Skitty can't KO many of the common threats she will face. Cute Charm is the preferred ability because Normalize prevents Skitty from hitting Ghost-types and Miracle Skin won't do much for a lead. With the given EVs, Skitty only hits 11 in both defenses, so don't plan on being able to take many hits. The common Mach Punch will do a lot to Skitty either way.</p>

[SET]
name: Normalize
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Return
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Foresight / Fake Out
item: Oran Berry
ability: Normalize
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 Atk / 76 SpD / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The combination of Normalize and Thunder Wave is a blessing for Skitty. Changing the typing of all its moves to Normal allows Skitty to paralyze Ground-type Pokemon such as Drilbur and Diglett. Sucker Punch with Normalize gives Skitty a STAB priority attack, which is extremely beneficial for revenge killing. Foresight is the icing on the cake as it allows Skitty to hit Ghost-types with the rest of the move set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Normalize is useful since it gives all of Skitty's attacks STAB. An Adamant nature is recommended because after Skitty paralyzes its foe, their Speed is cut by 1/4 and Skitty will become faster than them. With Oran Berry, Skitty will be healed at 50% of its health, aiding its durability.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Skitty has access to Baton Pass, Calm Mind, and Wish, so a support set can work. A nice anti-lead set can be used with Fake Out and Last Resort. A Choice Specs or offensive Calm Mind set is possible by utilizing Skitty's large special movepool, which includes strong coverage moves such as Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Shadow Ball.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Skitty falls to many common Fighting-types who boast high Attack and decent defenses, as well as priority moves such as Mach Punch. Timburr is a great example of a Mach Punch user, and Croagunk is commonly seen using the special version, Vacuum Wave. Scraggy sponges Skitty's attacks well since Skitty is not too powerful and does not bother Scraggy with its coverage moves. Gastly beats the Normalize set, but still must watch for Sucker Punch and Faint Attack on any non-Normalize sets.</p>
