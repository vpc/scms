[Overview]

<p>Tyrogue is almost never seen in Little Cup. This is mainly due to his terrible stats. He has a decent movepool with many priority moves, but his low Attack stat means he's not very effective at using them. He is almost completely outclassed by nearly every other Fighting-type as well. Overall, Tyrogue is an incredibly weak Pokemon that is not worth using at all.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Tyrogue is the only Pokemon with all three of Fake Out, Mach Punch, and Bullet Punch in Little Cup, so a moveset using priority moves is the best option. Hi Jump Kick is Tyrogue's strongest move by far, and with only 14 Attack, the power is very welcome. Fake Out can deal free damage on the first turn that Tyrogue is in, and activates Tyrogue's Toxic Orb. Mach Punch is Tyrogue's STAB priority move, while Bullet Punch is yet another form of priority that can at least hit Gastly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Tyrogue has major problems with Ghost-types such as Gastly and Duskull, so Houndour and Stunky are good teammates to help with those. Slowpoke can take every move that Tyrogue uses quite easily. Chinchou is a great teammate for Tyrogue, as it can check Slowpoke easily. Shelmet resists Hi Jump Kick and survives priority attacks with plenty of HP to spare, so it is another Pokemon that Tyrogue needs help dealing with. Doduo and Taillow both can deal super effective damage to Shelmet with STAB Brave Bird.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Tyrogue actually has a few other good moves to consider. Earthquake is a decent option to hit Poison-types, which Tyrogue usually has trouble damaging. Rock Slide hits Flying- and Bug-types such as Mantyke and Shelmet hard. Pursuit can deal decent damage to Gastly, though it won't KO it. Bulk Up could help Tyrogue hit harder, but he rarely has time to set up due to his low HP and defenses. Brick Break and Low Sweep lack power, but they are more reliable than Hi Jump Kick. Facade used with Toxic Orb and Guts is an interesting option to hit opponents neutrally, but many others outclass Tyrogue in this regard. Counter could catch something off guard if Tyrogue holds a Focus Sash, which can come in handy. Tyrogue is one of only a few Pokemon with Foresight and Rapid Spin, but he doesn't have nearly enough bulk to use the moves effectively. Toxic is a decent option to status Slowpoke, which otherwise switches in easily. Magic Coat is a good move, but most Pokemon would just attack Tyrogue instead of trying to status him. Finally, Trick Room support is a viable option, as Tyrogue is quite slow.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ghost-types can switch in on Hi Jump Kick and Mach Punch and don't take much damage from Tyrogue's other moves. Slowpoke and Shelmet easily wall every move Tyrogue can use. Doduo and Taillow outspeed and easily get an OHKO with their STAB moves. Hippopotas has good bulk, so it can take a Hi Jump Kick in a pinch and retaliate with Earthquake.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Tyrogue gets Vital Spirit from the Dream World, but can't use it in Little Cup because he is a male only species. This means he cannot pass the ability down and thus cannot be obtained with it below level 10. However, this isn't that big a loss. Vital Spirit is a decent ability, but Guts is much better because it can raise Tyrogue's Attack. Therefore, Vital Spirit would rarely see any use.</p>
