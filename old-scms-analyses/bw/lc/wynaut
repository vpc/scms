[Overview]

<p>Wynaut hasn't changed a bit since DPP; its small yet perfectly suited movepool remains the same, along with its always-useful role in helping set-up Pokemon. Wynaut did gain a boost in the introduction of the Eviolite, which only adds to its durability. With so many new threats to stop and support, Wynaut remains a very good Pokemon in this generation.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>Wynaut retains the same niche it had last generation, as its impressive ability to dispose of Choice-locked attackers is invaluable to many Pokemon. There are also many strong attackers which can blast holes through teams that Wynaut traps and KOes, such as Snover. It also has the ability to get rid of slower attackers and Encore set-up Pokemon, meaning Wynaut will almost always be of use in every game.</p>

<p>Wynaut's movepool, while only consisting of eight moves, is perfectly suited for its job. Shadow Tag lets it trap opposing Pokemon so that they can't switch out. If the Pokemon is locked into a physical attack, Counter will dispose of it, unless Wynaut is KOed, which is unlikely considering its massive HP stat and respectable defenses. Mirror Coat bounces back special attacks. However, the crux of Wynaut's viability lies in the move Encore. Encore lets it force attackers to repeat a move, meaning you can either switch in a Pokemon that takes little damage from the attack and set up, or just KO it with Counter or Mirror Coat. If your opponent tries to set up on Wynaut, Encore lets you switch in a Pokemon to set up on it while your opponent is locked into a move for three turns.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>While only three moves are sufficient for Wynaut to complete its job, it has several options to fill the last slot. Safeguard lets it Encore a status move such as Thunder Wave, use Safeguard, and allow a Pokemon like Dratini to switch in and set up Dragon Dance without worry. On the other hand, Tickle can be used to weaken a wall so far that it will be killed by a Pursuit user easily. Destiny Bond is another option for the last slot, though Wynaut's low Speed stat without any investment makes it rather useless against most attackers.</p>

<p>The EVs are rather self-explanatory. Wynaut reaches an HP stat of 27 with these EVs, along with 14 in each defensive stat. When boosted by the Eviolite, Wynaut will almost never be OHKOed. The 12 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed minimum Speed Bronzor, letting it Encore a move such as Stealth Rock before it can switch moves. A Bold nature is used instead of an Impish one to minimize confusion damage when switching into a Choice Machop's DynamicPunch. It is also recommended you make its Attack IV 0.</p>

<p>The choice between Oran Berry and Eviolite is hard to make. While the Eviolite makes Wynaut almost impenetrable, it reduces the damage done by Counter and Mirror Coat greatly. Oran Berry allows both moves to hit at a higher power and allows Wynaut to recover off damage. However, Wynaut can be OHKOed by powerful attackers such as Scraggy.</p>

<p>Wynaut's job is to remove Choice Scarf Pokemon and to allow set-up Pokemon to do their jobs easily. As such, Pokemon who enjoy this luxury are clearly good teammates. Aron is a perfect partner to Wynaut, as it can come in on one of its numerous resistances and set up a Rock Polish. Mantyke and Shellder are in a similar boat, with their sky-high defensive stats letting them set up Rain Dance or Shell Smash on many weak or resisted attacks. Wynaut makes a great addition to any sand-based team, as it can trap and KO Snover and ensure sand stays in effect.</p>

[Other Options] 

<p>As mentioned several times earlier, Wynaut's movepool is slightly lacking in quantity. All the viable moves have been mentioned already. Splash is useless, unless you really want to rub your victory in your opponent's face. If that's the case you're better off using Magikarp or Hoppip, however. Charm on the other hand is plausible, but Tickle tends to be better since it not only lowers Attack but Defense as well, having added utility.</p>

<p>The amount of Speed Wynaut runs is up to the user. Wynaut's Speed, with a neutral nature, can hover anywhere between 8 and 12. Wynaut needs Speed to outrun walls, and lock them into an attack. Wynaut outspeeds Ferroseed with no investment, and you can choose to go with the lowest Speed possible to take as little damage from Gyro Ball as possible. 172 Speed is needed to outspeed no Speed Frillish, but this really takes away from its defenses. 12 Speed EVs are probably the optimal investment, a small amount to outspeed walls, but not enough to impact defenses. If you would like Wynaut to outspeed Hippopotas, 92 Speed EVs are needed.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>There is no real counter to Wynaut, as, barring a few exceptions, nothing can switch in. However there are several ways to dispose of Wynaut. After Wynaut faints a Pokemon, a strong Pursuiter, such as Pawniard, can come in and knock it out. Common Choice-locked Pokemon which are often trapped by Wynaut might opt to run a set using an Expert Belt or Oran Berry to trick Wynaut into using a reflecting move while they boost up and then KO it. However, this is a very specialized approach which will rarely see use otherwise. Also, as Wynaut's only way of doing damage is reflecting an attack, specially attacking Dark-types and physical Ghost-types, such as Houndour and Duskull respectively, are immune to Wynaut's attacks. Other specific Pokemon who threaten Wynaut are Gastly and Scraggy. Taunt is an absolute killer to Wynaut, since once Taunted it can only use Counter and Mirror Coat. Lastly, anything with Volt Switch, U-turn, or a Shed Shell will avoid capture, effectively countering Wynaut as it can't do its job. Be warned, however, that if Wynaut uses Mirror Coat on Volt Switch or Counter on U-turn, the Pokemon that switches in will take damage.</p>
