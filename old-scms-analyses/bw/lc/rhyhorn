[Overview]

<p>Rhyhorn is a mixed bag as far as viability is concerned. High Attack, HP, and Defense are very useful, but low Speed and Special Defense really hold Rhyhorn back. Weaknesses to common Fighting- and Water-type moves further compound the issue, and stop Rhyhorn from reaching its full potential. Its typing isn't completely terrible, as it makes Rhyhorn one of the best switch-ins to common Flying-types. Rhyhorn might be notably similar to Geodude, but their movepools make them different from each other, meaning that neither is really outclassed by the other. Overall, Rhyhorn is solid, but isn't a great Little Cup Pokemon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rock Polish is a natural move for Rhyhorn to take advantage of, as its Speed doubles to a respectable 24 after one use. This outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon, as well as many Choice Scarf users, in Little Cup. Earthquake and Stone Edge are STAB moves that have amazing neutral coverage, so they are natural choices for moveslots. Rock Blast is an option over Stone Edge for the ability to break Substitutes, but isn't nearly as reliable, as it usually has lower power than Stone Edge. In the last slot, Swords Dance is a good choice, as Rhyhorn needs little extra coverage. Rhyhorn won't always have time to use the move, but it can be very helpful against slower opponents such as Hippopotas. The other option to consider is Megahorn, as it always 2HKOes Slowpoke when Rhyhorn holds a Life Orb, and it can even do so on average with Eviolite.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Rhyhorn makes good use of both Life Orb and Eviolite, and both have their advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. Life Orb guarantees the 2HKO on Scraggy and Ferroseed with Earthquake, while Eviolite versions manage to gain the 2HKO only sometimes on Scraggy and never against Ferroseed. Life Orb also provides a 2HKO on average on Slowpoke with Earthquake followed by Megahorn, but with Eviolite, that is rarely ever the case. On the other hand, Rhyhorn gains durability with Eviolite, which allows it to usually survive an unboosted Hi Jump Kick from Scraggy. It also grants Rhyhorn the ability to always tank two hits from Ferroseed's Gyro Ball. When holding a Life Orb, Rhyhorn can survive neither of the two scenarios.</p>

<p>Fire Blast is a lesser option in the last slot, with Rhyhorn's HP EVs shifted to Special Attack, as it will likely OHKO Ferroseed with one layer of Spikes if using Life Orb. If using Eviolite, two switches in will do the same. Rhyhorn needs help when facing quite a few common opponents, the most important of which are Water-types such as Staryu. Chinchou is a great teammate for Rhyhorn, as it beats most Water-types easily. Grass-types such as Lileep, Cottonee, and Ferroseed pose a massive threat to Rhyhorn, as do Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Scraggy. Gastly is a solid check to some Fighting-types and Cottonee, so it works well as a teammate. Croagunk is another good option, as it does well against many common Fighting-types while holding its own against Grass-types as well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set lets Rhyhorn utilize its relatively high Attack stat to sweep. Earthquake is a good STAB move, and, along with the Life Orb boost, can deal heavy damage to a large number of Pokemon in the tier, including Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Staryu. Rock Blast is a good move to have due to its ability to hit multiple times, allowing Rhyhorn to deal damage to pesky Substitute users such as Misdreavus and Murkrow. In fact, in addition to 2HKOing Misdreavus, Rhyhorn OHKOes all Murkrow with Rock Blast, making it an effective counter to Murkrow. Aqua Tail 2HKOes Hippopotas and OHKOes Drilbur, Numel, and other Rhyhorn, although these same Pokemon can be taken down by Earthquake as well. Aqua Tail also OHKOes Magnemite with the help of Stealth Rock, and is generally a better move than Earthquake as Magnemite might have Magnet Rise or an Air Balloon; alternatively, Fire Fang hits Bronzor hard. Lastly, Megahorn helps Rhyhorn deal with Bronzor and Slowpoke.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs maximize Attack, provide high amounts of bulk, and add an extra point in Speed. There is no real reason to give Rhyhorn extra Speed as it won't outrun anything of note; therefore, an Adamant nature is used instead of a Jolly one. A Choice Band can be used as it does not require Rhyhorn take recoil damage, but as it locks Rhyhorn into only one move, it is an inferior option. This set can also be used in Trick Room conditions, but make sure to use a Relaxed or Brave nature and 0 Speed EVs and IVs if you do so. Stone Edge's high critical hit rate can come in handy, but its imperfect accuracy allows Substitute Pokemon to run riot. Superpower can be utilized to defeat Scraggy.</p>

<p>In general, Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock make good teammates, as they help Rhyhorn convert a few 2HKOs to OHKOs against Pokemon such as Mienfoo. Bronzor, Hippopotas, and Dwebble make decent teammates due to their ability to set up Stealth Rock. Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Cottonee as well as Fighting-types such as Scraggy wreck Rhyhorn. Gastly is a good check to both Fighting-types and Cottonee, making it a viable teammate. Chinchou is another great teammate due to its ability to deal with most Water-types.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Superpower is a nice move that can deal major damage to Ferroseed, Lileep, and Scraggy, but the stat drops can force Rhyhorn to switch out. Crunch has little utility, but could be used as an accurate option to hit Gastly. Curse is an alternative boosting move, but Rhyhorn's many weaknesses and low Special Defense mean that it isn't very effective. Thunder Fang and Fire Fang can increase Rhyhorn's coverage a bit, but Geodude outclasses Rhyhorn here with its access to ThunderPunch and Fire Punch. Aqua Tail is worth some consideration, as it is Rhyhorn's best option against Ground-types. Ground-types aren't too common, however, so it is a lesser option than the listed moves. Rhyhorn learns Roar, Toxic, and Stealth Rock, but there are better Pokemon for supporting a team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Water-types such as Staryu work well, as they can take a hit from Rhyhorn and easily KO back. Grass-types, especially special attackers such as Lileep, do the same. Fighting-types with Drain Punch are very useful to stop Rhyhorn, as they can recover much of the HP lost to Rhyhorn's attacks and will usually come out on top. Hippopotas with Roar is usually a good option, though if Rhyhorn already has a Swords Dance in, it will take a large amount of damage in the process.</p>
