[Overview]

<p>While Spearow has good Attack and Speed, it is really set back by the fact that it has an extremely shallow movepool to work with. Its Normal / Flying typing doesn't help it either, as it is both weak to Stealth Rock and has a neutrality to the common Fighting-type attacks. Taillow mostly outclasses Spearow with its high Speed and access to Guts. However, Spearow has the makings of a good scout thanks to base 70 Speed and access to U-turn, while base 60 Attack means hits from Spearow are going to hurt. It also has access to Pursuit, meaning it can be a great trapper. Overall, given the right conditions, Spearow can work great on your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite how limited Spearow's movepool is, it has just enough going for it to be a great user of Choice Scarf. Drill Peck is in the first moveslot, gaining STAB and hitting Fighting- and Grass-types extremely hard thanks to Spearow's good base 60 Attack. Return is Spearow's second STAB move, with excellent neutral coverage. Quick Attack is another option in the second slot, having priority but also being significantly weaker than Return. U-turn is a great move for scouting and keeping momentum. Pursuit is used in the final moveslot as a great tool for putting Ghost- and Psychic-types into a checkmate position.</p>

<p>The given EVs maximize Spearow's Attack and Speed, with the rest being put in Spearow's defenses to increase its overall bulk. An Adamant nature is used over Jolly as Spearow already reaches 24 Speed with a Choice Scarf, and Spearow needs all the power it can get. Sniper is the preferred ability for Spearow, as not only can it be convenient at times, but it's the only ability Spearow can profit from competitively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Aside from the options given above, Spearow doesn't have much else to use on this set. It's possible to put some of Spearow's Special Defense EVs into its Special Attack and switch its nature to Naughty; you can then switch out one of the moves above with one from its special movepool. Options include Hidden Power, Heat Wave, and Ominous Wind. However, don't expect too much from Spearow and its Base 31 Special Attack. Spearow can also carry a Choice Band over a Choice Scarf and use a Jolly nature; Spearow will hit a lot harder but it will be much slower, which can be crucial in some cases.</p>

<p>Rapid Spinners make excellent teammates for Spearow, as it will be switching in and out often, with the potential to rack up Stealth Rock damage very quickly. Fighting-types are also good teammates to get rid of Rock- and Steel-types, who wall Spearow with ease. Dark-types are also helpful, as they get rid of Ghost-types who may try and come in on Spearow.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It must be emphasized again that Spearow is really strapped for competitive options. You can run 3 attacks and Agility or Substitute, but Spearow lacks coverage as well as actual attacking power. Spearow has access to Whirlwind and FeatherDance, but it's very frail, meaning that Spearow will have a tough time pulling it off without dying. Lastly, Toxic can be used as a filler on the Choice Scarf set to catch some walls on the switch in.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Stealth Rock is a great way to check Spearow, as it automatically puts a timer on how many times it can switch in and do damage. Chinchou and other fast Electric-types can easily knock out Spearow with a super effective STAB attack. Priority is another great way to deal with Spearow; it is hit neutrally or super effectively by all forms of priority, meaning it will be severely damaged or KOed. Anything that can take a hit from Spearow and hit back can also be called a check given Spearow's frailty. Lastly, Pursuit users often put Spearow in a checkmate position if they come in after a kill.</p>
