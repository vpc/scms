[Overview]
<p>Krookodile is one of the two Pokemon that receive the ability Intimidate, the other being Stoutland. Of these, Krookodile has a better typing, STAB attacks, and overall base stats. Intimidate is one of the best abilities in VGC 2011 because it lowers the Attack of both opposing Pokemon. Strong physical attackers like Conkeldurr, Scrafty, and Tornadus shake with fear when Krookodile steps on to the field. This makes Krookodile a great choice for most teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Krookodile has two of the best STAB attacks in VGC. Earthquake smacks around all Pokemon on the field, and the STAB boost compensates for the power drop of spread attacks. Crunch hits the myriad of Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage. Rock Slide KOes Flying-type Pokemon, and offers good coverage along with Krookodile's other moves. Low Sweep is rather situational, but it does help against Hydreigon and Virizion.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Using a 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 EV spread outpaces neutral natured 252 Speed Chandelure. Running maximum Speed on Krookodile only outspeeds neutral natured 252 Speed Excadrill, and ties with Leavanny. Both of these Pokemon are rarely seen outside of weather, so running maximum Speed on Krookodile is wasteful.</p>

<p>Flying-type Pokemon are the best teammates for Krookodile. Special mention goes to Thundurus, who can form a potent combo with Krookodile, as each Pokemon is immune to the other's STAB attack. Thundurus can also cripple support Pokemon with Taunt. Virizion resists both of Krookodile's STAB attacks, and can hit back with a super effective STAB attack of its own. Bisharp receives an Attack boost from Intimidate, but is outsped and KOed by Earthquake. Choice Scarf Jellicent is another fantastic check to Krookodile, as Water Spout will easily OHKO Krookodile when Jellicent is at full health.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Running 252 Speed EVs along with a Choice Scarf and an Adamant nature helps Krookodile to outspeed Choice Scarf Vanilluxe, at the cost of reliability and some bulk. This set can 2HKO the genies with Rock Slide, OHKO Choice Scarf Chandelure, and outspeed the few Ice-type Pokemon in VGC 2011. In terms of move choices, Foul Play is a very situational move, and most of the time Crunch is a better choice. Dark Gem can power up Crunch in order to do massive damage to common Trick Room users, but this job is generally better performed by Golurk.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hydreigon completely shuts down Krookodile, as it resists both of its STAB attacks. Krookodile can't do much to Amoonguss, one of the biggest threats in VGC 2011. Even Rock Slide cannot take down Mandibuzz, who can easily stall out Krookodile with Toxic and Roost. Conkeldurr can 2HKO Krookodile with its STAB Fighting-type attacks. Another check to Krookodile is Escavalier, who takes negligible damage from all of Krookodile's moves and KOes it in return with a STAB Megahorn.</p>
