[Overview]
<p>Say hello to the most unique Pokemon in Unova. Eelektross has absolutely no weaknesses and passable defenses. The strangest thing about this eel is its seemingly never-ending movepool, which makes Eelektross very unpredictable, as every set has the potency to decide the outcome of a game.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Few Pokemon can attain the amount of KOs that Eelektross boasts. Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics OHKOes Scrafty, Conkeldurr, and specially defensive Amoonguss. Wild Charge OHKOes most Jellicent and Tornadus, and does massive damage to everything else. Rock Slide is a coverage move for Fire-types and Landorus, if conserving the Flying Gem is important. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Protect and Crunch. Crunch gives more coverage against Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Musharna and Golurk. The main downfall to Eelektross is its low base Speed. However, it has enough bulk to function in and out of Trick Room.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is preferred to outspeed neutral-natured Amoonguss. Dragon Claw is generally a poor choice without STAB to back it up, but it hits Haxorus and Hydreigon for super effective damage. Brick Break is an alternative to Rock Slide or Crunch that can break Light Screen and Reflect while maintaining coverage on Hydreigon. Brick Break also hits Bisharp and other Steel-types a lot harder than Eelektross's other moves.</p>

<p>Due to the number of options Eelektross can choose from, it can fit relatively easily on most teams. Eelektross really appreciates the offensive power Hydreigon can bring to a team. Haxorus's ability, Mold Breaker, disregards Levitate. As a partner, Hydreigon can outspeed and OHKO non-Haban Berry versions of Haxorus. A Fake Out user is an excellent partner for Eelektross, keeping it at high health for an extra turn.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Discharge / Thunderbolt
move 2: Flamethrower
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Protect / Grass Knot
item: Sitrus Berry
nature: Modest
ability: Levitate
EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Eelektross's physically-based set is excellent, there are several good reasons to use a Special Attack-based set. Eelektross still achieves flawless coverage, and has access to STAB Discharge. Flamethrower and Hidden Power Ice round out coverage. Grass Knot is only necessary if Seismitoad becomes an issue. The Electric-type STAB move of choice is usually more powerful than Grass Knot, even against Jellicent.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sitrus Berry is very useful when facing Haxorus, Landorus, or Terrakion. Their main attacks might not grab the KO on Eelektross, and Sitrus Berry gives it the extra HP it needs for another turn or two of life. Running a Modest nature helps Eelektross work in and out of Trick Room. Discharge is the preferred option, but only if a teammate who isn't affected by the move, such as Landorus or Zebstrika, is present. Thunderbolt is preferred for a Trick Room team, because Discharge's paralysis rate helps out the other team.</p>

<p>Musharna and other bulky Pokemon take negligible damage from Eelektross's attacks, so a powerful physical attacker is the best partner to this set. Landorus has a high base Speed, immunity to Discharge, and access to a STAB Earthquake that Eelektross is not affected by, making it a top-notch teammate. Golurk and Krookodile also fit perfectly with Eelektross. Golurk creates a slower version of the common double genie combo, while Krookodile provides Intimidate. Bisharp is another decent partner to Eelektross, as long as Eelektross does not run Discharge. Zebstrika can make decent use of the Special Attack boost Discharge gives it, but Thundurus generally does a better job.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If your team is centered around Trick Room, a Brave or Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs (or 4 in the case of Hidden Power) is recommended. Running 4 Speed IVs with a Quiet nature outspeeds neutral Amoonguss outside of Trick Room, allowing Eelektross to attack the same turn Trick Room is set up. Unfortunately, 2 Speed IVs are the maximum number for Hidden Power to attain 70 Base Power, which means that Eelektross reaches the same Speed stat as Amoonguss. If Amoonguss is a serious problem, a Lum Berry may be used.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Haxorus can hit Eelektross with Earthquake thanks to its ability, Mold Breaker. Coba Berry Amoonguss can still give Eelektross some trouble. Golurk has to be wary of Grass Knot or Crunch, but other than that, its powerful Shadow Punch will do serious damage to Eelektross.</p>
