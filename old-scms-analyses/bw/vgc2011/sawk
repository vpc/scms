[Overview]
<p>Like Throh, Sawk faces massive competition from the myriad of other Fighting-types in VGC 2011. Mienshao is faster, and has a larger movepool including Fake Out. Terrakion boasts better stats and a Rock-type STAB. Really, Sawk’s only saving grace is his access to Sturdy and Inner Focus, both of great abilities, but not nearly enough to push him to the same level as the other two. However, unlike Mienshao, Sawk has access to one of the best STAB moves in the game, Close Combat, and arguably does better in teams running both Tailwind and Trick Room than the other two. All in all, Sawk can still be very dangerous when played right.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sawk is a pretty straightforward but formidable physical attacker. Close Combat and Rock Slide both give good coverage. Stone Edge is usable over Rock Slide, having more Base Power and hitting through Wide Guard. Thanks to Sawk’s middling Speed, he works great in teams running both Tailwind and Trick Room. When Tailwind is up, he will almost always outspeed the opposing team, but if they set up Tailwind too, set up Trick Room and Sawk will probably have the Speed advantage even when the opposing team's Tailwind runs out. Combined with Sturdy's guarantee of surviving one hit, Sawk can be very menacing. While Sawk is not the fastest user, Taunt is generally a helpful move. Quick Guard and Protect both have their uses, and either one is a good choice depending on your team. Payback hits Psychic- and Ghost-types harder than any other move Sawk has. Although somewhat redundant due to his Fighting-type STAB, Earthquake is a strong spread attack good for damaging both of your opponent's Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread assumes you run an Adamant nature and lets Sawk outrun the fastest Pokemon he can, Timid Samurott. If using Jolly, an alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe should be run, allowing Sawk to outspeed Adamant Krookodile and Haxorus, and Speed tie with Modest Hydreigon. Focus Sash can be used when using Inner Focus due to Sawk’s feeble defenses. If Amoonguss is using a Mental Herb, it can negate Taunt the first time it is used, and put Sawk to sleep. For this reason, running Lum Berry is also an option. Fighting Gem is for raw power on the first hit.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Sawk fits well into teams running both Tailwind and Trick Room due to his middling speed. Fast Guard makes him a good partner for something trying to set up without being stopped by Fake Out such as a Trick Room user. It is recommended that you pack something fast that can cover Sawk's weaknesses to Psychic- and Flying-type attacks such as Thunderous or Krookodile. A Wide Guard user is always welcome as with field attacks, your opponent won’t have to double attack Sawk to break Sturdy. Fast Guard or Anger Powder users can also help protect a Sturdy Sawk from a revenge kill.</p>


[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Rock Slide / Stone Edge
move 3: Earthquake / Stone Edge
move 4: Payback / Reversal
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Sturdy / Inner Focus
nature: Adamant
EVs: 4 Hp / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sawk can make good Choice Scarf user due to his two abilities. With Sturdy, if you mess up once, Sawk is still in the game. Inner Focus ensures that Fake Out does not prevent Sawk attacking on the first turn, potentially leading to a surprise KO. As with the first set, Close Combat and Rock Slide will be your main attacking moves. Payback is Sawk's best option against bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types, especially those which resist Rock Slide such as Golurk. Reversal is also an option; after Sawk is brought down to between 1 and 13 HP, you can switch out and when you come back in, you have the option to use a Fighting-type move which will outdamage Payback against Psychic-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Jolly with 44 HP / 252 Atk / 212 Spe and a Choice Scarf is enough to outspeed Accelgor and allows some extra bulk. Having two Rock-Type attacks looks redundant, but Earthquake offers redundant coverage with Close Combat and as mentioned above Sawk needs a way to hit through Wide Guard.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sawk doesn’t have much else to do besides attacking. Sawk is practically built to use Counter then sweep with Reversal, given that he has a built-in Focus Sash. Sawk also learns both Sunny Day and Rain Dance and with Inner Focus can set up without worrying about Fake Out; if you need a Fighting-type on your team he makes a decent choice. Sawk also gets Fling, allowing him to Fling a King's Rock at a Ghost-type setting up Trick Room; thanks to Inner Focus, Sawk won't be stopped by Fake Out. Bulk Up is Sawk's best stat-boosting move, but in this regard he is largely outclassed by Scrafty.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Psychic-types and Golurk are the best counters, as the best Sawk can do is Payback or Earthquake. Ghost-types deal with Sawk well if he is locked into Close Combat, and if he is locked into any other move he can be dealt with accordingly. Haxorus can get past Sturdy with Mold Breaker but must be wary of faster Sawk—those with a Jolly nature or a Choice Scarf. Anything faster such as Tornadus or Archeops can kill Inner Focus sets. Once Sturdy is used, Conkeldurr or anything with priority can revenge kill him.</p>
