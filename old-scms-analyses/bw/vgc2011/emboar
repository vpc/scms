[Overview]
<p>Emboar is a fantastic Trick Room Pokemon, and with its sky-high Attack and low Speed, it can sweep through teams with ease. Its weakness to Water is a severe hindrance, as a Water Spout from Jellicent or a Surf from Hydreigon will easily take it out, but despite this, Emboar is a great pick for any Trick Room team, and has great staying power with its high HP.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Flare Blitz is Emboar's main STAB attack, dealing lots of damage at the cost of 1/3 recoil damage. Hammer Arm is Emboar's other STAB move, and comes with the added boon of lowering Emboar's Speed by one stage, which is very useful under Trick Room. Rock Slide is used for coverage and hits Thundurus and Tornadus, who can otherwise OHKO Emboar with their STAB Flying-type attacks, for super effective damage. Rock Slide also covers Chandelure, who resists both of Emboar's STABs. In the last slot, Protect is used to allow Emboar to stay alive long enough for its partner to KO an opposing threat or get Trick Room set up. Wild Charge can be used to hit Jellicent, but Protect is usually the superior option.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Emboar dies quickly, despite its bulk, due to its common weaknesses and Flare Blitz recoil, and while Life Orb compounds the problem, it grants a very welcome offensive boost to enhance Emboar's destructive performance during its limited time.</p>

<p>Emboar needs Trick Room support to really do anything, otherwise it can be easily outsped and OHKOed. Common Trick Room users like Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Musharna are helpful. Anything that can handle Jellicent is a welcome partner, as Jellicent stops Emboar cold. Musharna is excellent with Emboar, as it can use Helping Hand to give Emboar even more power.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Brick Break can be used if you don't like Hammer Arm's 90% accuracy, but the power drop is usually not worth the slight accuracy increase. If the recoil from Flare Blitz turns you away, Heat Crash has no recoil, though its damage varies on the target's weight, only making it as powerful as Flare Blitz in the case of very light-weight Pokemon such as Amoonguss. This variable damage output makes Flare Blitz the decidedly more attractive option. Head Smash is an option instead of Rock Slide for an immense power increase but the at the cost of much lower accuracy and recoil. Furthermore, Head Smash only hits one opponent. A specially oriented set could be viable, utilizing Emboar's wide special movepool, but Emboar's middling Special Attack makes this a decidedly unattractive option.</p>

<p>If the slow, bulky, hard-hitting Pokemon of Trick Room is not your style, Emboar could be used on a team with Tailwind support, attempting to quickly attack and KO the opposition before they get a chance to move. When utilizing a faster set, Superpower should be used over Hammer Arm so as not to lower Emboar's Speed. Concern over Superpower's Attack and Defense drop should be dismissed, as Emboar is likely not living long enough for the drops to matter.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Jellicent is a hard counter for Emboar without Wild Charge, as Emboar can't touch Jellicent and is easily defeated with either Water Spout or Surf in return. Even with Wild Charge, Emboar struggles to 2HKO Jellicent. Hydreigon can outspeed and OHKO Emboar with Surf if Trick Room is not up.</p>
