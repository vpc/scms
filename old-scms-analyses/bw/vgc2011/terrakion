[Overview]
<p>Terrakion is a staple for many teams with its high Attack and Speed. However, having several weaknesses to some of the most common attacking types in VGC leaves it with several challenges to overcome. However, with the right support behind its nearly unresisted STAB combination, Terrakion will be a deadly foe to take on for the opponent.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a set built to be used with Tailwind support, and deal damage right off the bat. Close Combat and Rock Slide are Terrakion's dual STAB attacks, which are only resisted by Golurk in VGC 2011. Quick Attack finishes off weakened foes. Protect can be used to stall out Trick Room or avoid taking an attack while Terrakion's partner attacks and KOes a threat. Quick Guard stops priority attacks such as Fake Out and Mach Punch, which can help Terrakion stay alive and allow a partner to set up Tailwind or boost Terrakion's attack with Beat Up. Safeguard blocks Spore from one of the most common Pokemon in the metagame, Amoonguss.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash is generally the preferred item to help Terrakion avoid getting OHKOed by one of Terrakion's many weaknesses, but Life Orb provides the power to muscle through the opponent. The choice of nature is one between power and Speed, but an Adamant nature should only be used if you have Tailwind support to compensate for the lower Speed. The EV spread is fairly straightforward, focusing on getting as much power and Speed as possible, while 4 Defense EVs allow Terrakion to always survive Tornadus's Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics.</p>

<p>Anything that can set up Tailwind is a boon to Terrakion, making Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Tornadus good teammates. Whimsicott can also be used with a Choice Scarf for a Beat Up combo, raising Terrakion's Attack up to four stages in one turn and making it deadly in an instant. Hydreigon, Landorus, and Thundurus are also good candidates to partner with Terrakion, allowing it to unleash powerful Earthquakes without the fear of hurting its partner. Musharna is good for taking down other Fighting-types and removing Trick Room if it gets set up. Musharna can also boost Terrakion's moves with Helping Hand.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Close Combat and Rock Slide are used once again for dual STABs, with the last two moves for coverage. Earthquake can be used if you don't like being locked into Quick Attack, but Quick Attack is a good option in the late-game. X-Scissor can deal heavy damage to Musharna and Reuniclus. Sacred Sword is an option here if the drop to Terrakion's defenses each time it uses Close Combat is worrisome, but this set is more about power and Speed than longevity.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The item choice is largely dependent on your team. On many teams, Terrakion would need a Choice Scarf as it has no other way of boosting its Speed (outside of Rock Polish, but that's generally not recommended in VGC). An Adamant nature should be used with Choice Scarf. However, if you have Tailwind support, a Choice Band and an Adamant nature are appropriate. Jolly should only be used if you are concerned about tying with other Terrakion. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed while the 4 Defense EVs allow it to take Tornadus's Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sacred Sword is an option here if the drop to Terrakion's defenses each time it uses Close Combat is worrisome. Sacred Sword also ignores defensive boosts, so Pokemon setting up with Bulk Up will take the full force of the blow. Generally, Close Combat is preferred because of its much superior power. Stone Edge could always be used over Rock Slide, but it misses more frequently and only hits one foe. If Conkeldurr is specifically a major concern Chople Berry can be used. X-Scissor is an option to deal super effective damage to Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, but it won't usually OHKO, and Terrakion will get OHKOed by Psychic in return. Safeguard could be useful when Terrakion is a lead, keeping Amoonguss and its 100% accurate Spore at bay. Helping Hand, while somewhat of a novelty on Terrakion, lets Terrakion boost its partner's attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Jellicent stops Terrakion in its tracks, as, without a boost, Terrakion is unable to hurt it significantly with Rock Slide. Golurk resists both of Terrakion's STAB attacks, and can hit back hard with STAB Earthquake. Strong Fighting-type Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Chople Berry Scrafty can take a hit and KO back. Anything with Earthquake that can outspeed Terrakion can usually take it down. If Trick Room is in effect, Musharna or Reuniclus can outspeed Terrakion and OHKO with STAB Psychic. Terrakion can't hurt Amoonguss, while Amoonguss can take a Rock Slide, put Terrakion to sleep with Spore, and then follow up with Giga Drain.</p>
