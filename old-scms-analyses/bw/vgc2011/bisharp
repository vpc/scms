[Overview]
<p>Bisharp's great offensive STAB attacks and priority in the form of Sucker Punch makes it a potent threat to most teams in VGC 2011. However, its typing is a double-edged sword. While it gives Bisharp resistances to many common attacking types, Bisharp is also weak to extremely common attacks such as Heat Wave, Mach Punch, and Earthquake. Overall, Bisharp is a dangerous offensive threat which every team should be capable of dealing with.</p>

[Set Comments]
<p>Bisharp can be a valuable asset to many teams. Its STAB Sucker Punch does massive damage to the common frail Tailwind attackers, as well as Ghost-type Pokemon such as Chandelure. Iron Head and Brick Break round out coverage, while Protect stops Fake Out and Mach Punch. Night Slash is a great move on Bisharp, hitting nearly every Trick Room Pokemon for super effective damage, while being able to damage Pokemon who are using support moves, unlike Sucker Punch. Either ability is viable. Defiant raises Bisharp's Attack when facing Stoutland or Krookodile, as well as preventing strategies such as Tickle or Charm from working. Inner Focus does have its uses, however, especially if the opponent mispredicts Bisharp's ability and tries to use Fake Out.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>A Focus Sash is a great item for Bisharp. It stops Bisharp from being OHKOed by Chandelure's or Volcarona's Heat Wave, Landorus's Earthquake, or Conkeldurr's STAB move of choice. Iron Head will always OHKO Terrakion after Close Combat's Defense drop. If Terrakion does not use Close Combat, Iron Head followed by Sucker Punch will grab the KO.</p>

<p>Mandibuzz and Amoonguss, the premier walls in VGC 2011, can easily take on Bisharp's STAB attacks. Therefore, a strong special attacker makes an excellent partner. Thundurus is one of the best partners for Bisharp, stopping Amoonguss with Taunt and disposing of Mandibuzz with Thunderbolt. Volcarona does a similar job, but unlike Thundurus, it isn't immune to the Earthquake that Bisharp inevitably attracts.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Swords Dance can work well with a Focus Sash and Sucker Punch, and can be especially effective when partnered with a Rage Powder user such as Amoonguss. Low Sweep can really help against Hydreigon and Krookodile, 2HKOing with the Speed drop. If another Pokemon on your team is already holding a Focus Sash, a type-resist berry can also work. Occa Berry or Shuca Berry are the best options, allowing Bisharp to survive a super effective Heat Wave or Earthquake, because even a Chople Berry can't always keep Bisharp alive after Conkeldurr's Drain Punch or Hammer Arm. Substitute can work instead of Protect, as it eases prediction for Sucker Punch and gains a large advantage against Trick Room teams.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Conkeldurr can make short work of Bisharp, 2HKOing it with Mach Punch. Mispredicting is Bisharp's downfall, as deciding whether to use Sucker Punch or another attack can decide the outcome of a game. Bisharp can't do much to Amoonguss, who can easily Spore in return.</p>
