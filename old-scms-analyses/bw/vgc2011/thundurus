[Overview]
<p>Commonly referred to as a "genie", Thundurus is a new Pokemon introduced in BW. With its Electric / Flying typing, wide movepool, and the useful Prankster ability, it's a force to be reckoned with in the VGC 2011 metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The choice between Thunderbolt and Discharge is a tough one. Thunderbolt is stronger, but only hits one opponent, and while Discharge hits both foes and has a higher paralysis chance, it hits your partner too! Discharge should only be used if Thundurus is paired with a Ground-type (e.g. Landorus) or a Pokemon with Telepathy (e.g. Musharna). The choice of Hidden Power is difficult. Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types such as Landorus, but Hidden Power Flying gives Thundurus another STAB, and Electric / Flying is resisted by only a handful of Pokemon in VGC 2011. Once again, this depends on your team. If you have troubles with Ground-types, Hidden Power Ice is probably the way to go, but if you have problems with Grass- and Fighting-types, then Hidden Power Flying would be better. In the third moveslot, Taunt stops Tailwind and Trick Room setup from opposing Pokemon. Thunder Wave slows down foes and has +1 priority with Prankster. Protect stalls out Trick Room or Tailwind, and allows a partner to KO a Pokemon that threatens Thundurus. Substitute, however, has the advantage of possible repeated use and can block status as well.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Charti Berry allows Thundurus to hold up an extra turn against the very common Rock Slides that plague VGC, but Electric Gem gives the power to OHKO Jellicent and prevent it from setting up Trick Room. The EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed for better sweeping capabilities. Timid is the recommended nature for Speed, but with Tailwind up, Modest is viable for increased attacking power.</p>

<p>Ground-types such as Krookodile and Landorus are good supporters for Thundurus, as they can use Earthquake while Thundurus uses Discharge. Musharna has Telepathy so Discharge doesn't affect it and Helping Hand can boost Discharge's power.</p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Thunder
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Flying
move 4: Taunt / Protect
item: Damp Rock / Charti Berry
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Rain Dance, Thundurus can fire off 100% accurate Thunders, as well as support its Water-type teammates with pseudo-Helping Hand boosts to their STABs. Discharge should not be considered on this set because Thunder is so much more powerful, and carries the same 30% chance of paralysis. The choice between Hidden Power types is difficult, but once again, it depends on your team's needs; Ice for Ground-types, and Flying for Grass- and Fighting-types. Taunt stops Tailwind and Trick Room from being set up, but Protect can keep Thundurus alive for another turn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Timid is absolutely needed for this set, as Tailwind support may not be available, and it needs as much Speed as possible. Damp Rock keeps rain up for 8 turns, but with most VGC battles lasting as few as 3 turns, Charti Berry may often be the superior choice. The EVs let Thundurus get as much Speed and power as it can.</p>

<p>Tailwind support is helpful for this set, though it is not necessarily required. Tailwind and Rain together make a fantastic combo for Thundurus. Amoonguss makes a great partner as rain rids its fatal weakness to Fire-type attacks, and Rage Powder lets Thundurus easily set up rain and sweep with Thunder. Seismitoad, as the only Swift Swimmer in VGC 2011, is a great partner for Thundurus, with rain doubling its Speed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Grass Knot and Focus Blast each have merits. Though they get somewhat redundant coverage, their main perk is hitting Rock-types super effectively while also hitting a few other key targets as well. Focus Blast hits Steel-types hard, and Grass Knot takes out Seismitoad. Dark Pulse can be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Chandelure and Reuniclus, but setup is usually Thundurus's main goal. Nasty Plot could be utilized along with a Rage Powder user such as Amoonguss, but with all the spread attacks and double targeting commonly found in VGC, Thundurus will have great difficulty surviving long enough to make use of its Nasty Plot boost.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Rock-types can at least 2HKO Thundurus with Rock Slide, and fear nothing in return unless it carries Grass Knot or Focus Blast. Even when faced with the threat of these super effective attacks, common Rock-types such as Terrakion often carry Focus Sash. If Trick Room goes up, Jellicent can hit Thundurus hard with Ice Beam or Blizzard. Gigalith has Rock Blast, which hits through Charti Berry, so if Trick Room gets set up Gigalith is OHKOing Thundurus.</p>
