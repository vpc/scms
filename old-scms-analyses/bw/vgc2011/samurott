[Overview]
<p>Samurott is one of the more capable Pokemon in VGC 2011. Sporting great mixed offensive stats and decent defenses, Samurott can take hits as well as dish them out. With an odd Speed stat of 70, Samurott can function reliably in both Trick Room and Tailwind.</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>Samurott has a relatively low Special Attack stat of 108, which is outclassed by several other Pokemon in VGC 2011. However, Samurott’s bulk and great movepool allow it to have its own niche. First off, Samurott has a huge amount of options for a STAB attack. Surf is good for hitting both opponents, but it also deals damage to your partner unless they have a way of dodging it, such as Water Absorb or Telepathy. Hydro Pump has a considerable amount of power, dealing large amounts of damage to common threats, but its low accuracy may make it undesirable. For that reason, Scald is a suitable replacement. While it sports a measly 80 Base Power, its reliable accuracy and chance to burn make it a great addition to Samurott's moveset. The choice between Ice Beam and Blizzard is one of reliability versus spread damage. The third attacking move depends on what threatens your team more. If other Water-types are a threat, than Grass Knot should be chosen, but if Fighting-types are more threatening to your team, then you should choose Air Slash. Detect is for general utility, and Life Orb allows Samurott to hit as hard as possible, as does a Modest nature.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>This set is meant to be rearranged depending on what your team needs. If used on a Trick Room team, then a Quiet nature is preferable, while if used on any other team, Modest is the nature of choice. Aqua Jet can be used to finish off weak opponents; if you choose to use the move, then a Mild nature is advised.</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>Samurott has access to a great physical movepool consisting of Water- and Bug-type moves, which get perfect coverage in VGC 2011 outside of Jellicent and the rarely seen Swanna. Swords Dance boosts Samurott’s Attack to obscene levels and can be set up during a predicted Protect. The choice of STAB is once again difficult, each move having an advantage over the others. Aqua Jet is probably the best choice if Samurott is not in Trick Room, as Samurott can bypass its low Speed to hit several prominent threats hard. Waterfall and Aqua Tail are the other two options, one boasting accuracy and the chance of flinching, and the other having a higher Base Power. The choice of Bug-type move is simply one of power versus accuracy, and is dependent on what the team needs to accomplish. Detect is for easing prediction.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>If Samurott is unable to find time to set up, then Swords Dance can be replaced with another STAB move. Dragon Tail can be used in order to mess up Trick Room teams, but it lacks use besides that and can be easily drawn towards an opposing Amoonguss. Night Slash is another option that can be used over Swords Dance, covering Jellicent, who walls this set otherwise.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Samurott lacks good moves outside of its great primary choices. If the Life Orb recoil becomes too much of a burden for you, then a Sitrus Berry can be a good item replacement to add to Samurott's bulk. A Wacan Berry is also useful for allowing Samurott to survive a Thunderbolt from Thundurus, one of Samurott’s greatest counters.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Thundurus is as close to a 100% Samurott counter as possible, able to outspeed and KO it if Samurott is not holding a Wacan Berry. Virizion also thoroughly beats Samurott, outspeeding it and dealing a huge amount of damage with STAB Leaf Blade.</p>
