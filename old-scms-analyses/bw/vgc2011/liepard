[Overview]
<p>Liepard is the fastest user of Fake Out in VGC; however, a bad typing and dismal defenses keep it from being a top tier threat. STAB Sucker Punch and various support moves make Liepard usable, but it is rather predictable on the whole, and outclassed by other common VGC Pokemon. Snatch is Liepard's best weapon against common Tailwind teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Liepard is the fastest user of Fake Out in VGC. Unfortunately, this isn't much of a advantage for it, as Mienshao has Inner Focus, and is therefore unaffected by Liepard's Fake Out. STAB Sucker Punch is the second move on the set, and it does massive damage to Chandelure, Jellicent, and has a chance to 2HKO Thundurus and Tornadus. Snatch is Liepard's selling point. It steals the effects of common support moves such as Tailwind and Wide Guard as they are used, while it prevents set up in front of Liepard. Protect can be useful as it helps Liepard when it is confronted by one of the abundant Fighting-types; however, Encore helps Liepard take advantage of Pokemon that attempt to use Protect against a predicted Fake Out. Liepard is best used when common Tailwind Pokemon are seen in the Team Preview. Fake Out followed by Snatch will disrupt Whimsicott's and Tornadus's strategy; however, one must be aware that Snatch does not steal Whimsicott's Encore.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Limber is used over Unburden for a few reasons. Limber prevents paralysis from Discharge or Prankster Thunder Wave, as well as the small chance of paralysis from Effect Spore Amoonguss. Unburden can be relatively useful for Liepard, as when equipped with a Dark Gem, Sucker Punch gets a great power boost, while Liepard itself will gain a good boost to its Speed. However, Liepard is then prone to an OHKO from almost any physical attacker in VGC 11, as it has to forsake its Focus Sash. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Mienshao, allowing Liepard to Encore an opponent's move before being hit by Drain Punch or Hi Jump Kick.</p>

<p>Liepard is a Pokemon capable of disrupting the opponent's strategy. As such, another Pokemon that can take advantage of the disruption is necessary. Pokemon capable of dealing heavy damage while functioning well in a Snatched Tailwind are the best teammates for Liepard. Terrakion, Chandelure, and Hydreigon are great choices for this role. Because of Liepard's mediocre defenses, any Pokemon with a high Attack stat that is not weak to Sucker Punch can handle Liepard. The best Pokemon for the job is Bisharp, as its abilities can render both Fake Out and Charm useless, while it also resists Liepard's main attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Charm is a handy move that neuters Haxorus, Scrafty, Conkeldurr, and many other slower physical attackers. Taunt is a fantastic move that stops Amoonguss cold and prevents Trick Room from being set up, which are two of Liepard's biggest problems. Thunder Wave can cripple Thundurus, Hydreigon, and similar fast threats. Liepard has access to Torment, Thief, and Covet, adding to its unpredictable nature. These moves, however, face sheer competition for a moveslot. Liepard may also be used to set up Sunny Day or Rain Dance, but this job is better left to Whimsicott and Thundurus, respectively.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Terrakion is Liepard's nemesis. Outspeeding it by a few points, carrying a super effective Close Combat, and grabbing an Attack boost from Liepard's prime attack makes Terrakion Liepard's greatest threat. Hydreigon is a decent check to Liepard. None of Hydreigon's common moves can be Snatched and it also resists Sucker Punch, so Hydreigon is free to attack as it likes. Krookodile is very similar to Hydreigon in this regard. Liepard has no way of dealing heavy damage to Bisharp and Mienshao, who can easily KO Liepard with a STAB move. Slower, hard hitting Pokemon such as Gigalith or Conkeldurr can shrug off a Sucker Punch and smack Liepard around with a STAB move of choice.</p>
