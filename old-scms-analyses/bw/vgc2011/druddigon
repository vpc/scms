[Overview]
<p>High Attack, above average defenses, and the only Dragon-type with low Speed gives Druddigon a unique role as the only Trick Room Dragon of VGC 2011. Offensively, it has a large physical movepool which includes a strong priority move in Sucker Punch. Its ability Sheer Force boosts moves with secondary effects such as Rock Slide and Fire Fang, giving it something over Haxorus. Defensively, 77 / 90 / 90 defenses aren't too shabby, and Druddigon's Dragon typing also brings a bunch of useful resistances to the table. Unfortunately, in conjunction with low Speed, its typing also means that, without Trick Room, Druddigon will lose out against the other two Dragon-types in VGC 2011.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dragon Claw hits everything but Steel- and Dragon-types for neutral damage, and backed by Life Orb, will hurt most things. Sucker Punch allows you to pick off weakened or frail opponents such as Chandelure and Jellicent. Being the 8th slowest 2011 VGC Pokémon, Druddigon is at home in Trick Room. With the Sheer Force boost, Crunch is more powerful than Sucker Punch, and while in Trick Room, Druddigon won't have to worry about being outsped as much. However, Sucker Punch is still nice to fall back on if things don't go as planned. Rock Slide is a great move as it hits both opponents and is boosted by Sheer Force. On the other hand, Superpower destroys anything that doesn't invest a lot in Defense and is weak to it.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Without Life Orb, you miss out on some crucial Sucker Punch KOs. This includes a 60% chance to OHKO 4 HP neutral natured Jellicent, and a 100% chance to KO neutral natured 4 HP Chandelure and Cryogonal. Haban Berry however, allows Druddigon to survive STAB Dragon-type attacks, making it last a little longer. If not using Trick Room, 20 EVs in speed outpaces Eelektross, 60 outpaces Golurk, 84 outpaces Scrafty and 100 outpaces Jellicent, assuming an Adamant Druddigon against the above enemies with neutral natures and no Speed EVs.</p>

<p>Being weak to Dragon- and Ice-type attacks, Druddigon appreciates a Steel-type, or any other partner resistant to Ice-type attacks, to deter the spamming of Blizzard. In return, Druddigon's useful resistances can deter the enemy from spamming Heat Wave, Discharge and Water Spout. Together, Druddigon and Terrakion counter Heat Wave and Water Spout leads, and somewhat counter the Hydreigon / Jellicent combo. Terrakion nails Hydreigon with Close Combat and Volcarona or Chandelure with Rock Slide, while Druddigon resists both Water Spout and Heat Wave, and can KO both Chandelure and Jellicent with Life Orb-boosted Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Dragon Tail in conjunction with Terrakion or another Quick Guard user is a great deterrent to Trick Room. If using Rock Slide, a partner with a strong Fighting- or Fire-type move alongside Druddigon is helpful against Steel-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>The attacking moves listed above essentially summarize the whole of Druddigon's useful offensive movepool, but it does get Thunder Fang, Fire Fang, and Earthquake. Fire Fang, while much weaker than Superpower, reaches an impressive 109 BP with Life Orb and Sheer Force, and comes free of stat drops. It also does tremendous damage to Escavalier and Amoonguss. Glare is an interesting option to catch the enemy off guard, but is best not used while utilizing Trick Room. Also, if you are not using an attack with a secondary effect, be sure to use Rough Skin, as there is no reason to miss out on free passive damage if you are not making use of Sheer Force's power boost.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Druddigon has no real counter as it 2HKOes every Pokemon in VGC 2011, but its low Speed and over-reliance on Sucker Punch to deal with faster foes can be taken advantage of by fast, powerful Pokemon or good prediction. Sets that lack Superpower or Fire Fang are helpless against most Steel-types. Outside of Trick Room, any faster Pokemon that doesn't die to Sucker Punch, and can hit hard with a super effective Ice- or Dragon-type move will checkmate Druddigon. Despite having a trollish base 48 Speed, 252 HP Conkeldurr will beat it one on one, as Dragon Claw with Life Orb does 53% max, while Drain Punch severely hurts Druddigon and restores Conkeldurr's health. Keep in mind, however, that the tables will turn a bit with Rough Skin. Haxorus and Hydreigon will beat Druddigon one on one as both are faster. Hydreigon's resistance to Dark-type moves also makes Sucker Punch futile.</p>
