[Overview]
<p>Golurk is an often overlooked Pokemon with an excellent typing. This robot boasts an immunity to Normal-, Electric-, and Fighting-type moves, including the omnipresent Fake Out. It also resists Terrakion's STAB attacks. Golurk possesses a huge Attack stat and adequate defenses. It functions as an "anti-Trick Room" Pokemon, and is capable of quickly taking out Trick Room users.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With boosts from Iron Fist and Ghost Gem, Shadow Punch scores OHKOes on all Quiet 252 HP / 0 Def Trick Room users bar Cofagrigus, who just barely survives. This is invaluable when considering the tremendous impact Trick Room has on the outcome of a battle. Earthquake gets a STAB boost and deals heavy damage to any Steel-type Pokemon that resist Shadow Punch. Hammer Arm hits Hydreigon hard, one of the few Pokemon that can shake off Golurk's other moves. Rock Slide is a coverage move to hit Flying-type Pokemon while conserving the Ghost Gem. It also hits Volcarona harder than Earthquake or Shadow Punch. If Rock Slide's coverage is unnecessary, Protect is always a solid choice. Protect benefits Golurk when going up against Chandelure and certain Water-type Pokemon. However, the ghost robot's turns are usually better spent attacking.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Using 20 Speed EVs lets Golurk outspeed Adamant Scrafty, usually allowing Golurk to hit twice (as Crunch does not OHKO) before going down. Keep in mind, however, that Hammer Arm's Speed drop will null this advantage. Golurk with maximum HP survives Scrafty's Crunch, Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, and many other super effective moves. Ghost Gem-boosted Shadow Punch does around 72%-78% to the most physically bulky Musharna. Any additional damage from a teammate will take out similar defensive Pokemon.</p>

<p>Golurk's numerous resistances and adequate defenses give it a lot of survivability, but covering the robot's weaknesses through team synergy will further increase Golurk's time on the field. Jellicent is the best candidate to team up with Golurk. Jellicent's presence discourages Surf and Water Spout, while Golurk is immune to Discharge. A faster partner can work well too, especially if Jellicent is too slow for your team. Thundurus makes good use of Discharge. It forms a ZapChomp-esque combination that is not easily stopped. Eelektross works similarly in Trick Room.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Golurk can work in a Trick Room environment with a Brave nature, 0 IVs in Speed, and 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD EVs. Not too much will change in terms of what it does, but it allows Golurk to fit on a Trick Room team. The additional Attack EVs bring up damage output a little more. With the Speed drop from Hammer Arm, Golurk will have an even easier time in Trick Room.</p>

<p>Low Sweep is an option to slow down offensive Pokemon that threaten members of your team. Focus Sash can be used over Ghost Gem. In this case, Golurk loses the capability to OHKO most Trick Room users, but in exchange it will survive Bisharp's Sucker Punch, Jellicent's Water Spout, and Chandelure's Shadow Ball.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chandelure has enough power to OHKO Golurk with a powerful Shadow Ball. Teams that focus on abusing Water Absorb give Golurk a tough time. Another hard counter to Golurk is Krookodile. Its Intimidate cripples Golurk, and it can threaten Golurk with a super effective Crunch.</p>
