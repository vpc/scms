[Overview]
<p>Whimsicott is hands down one of the cutest Pokemon of all time. It is also the fastest Pokemon with Prankster and has an incredible support movepool. The sheer degree of possibility for customization of Whimsicott's sets makes prediction very difficult. From Tailwind to stall to a downright evil level 1 Trick Room user, Whimsicott is one of the biggest threats in the VGC 2011 metagame.</p>

[SET]
name: Tailwind
move 1: Tailwind
move 2: Encore
move 3: Helping Hand / Protect
move 4: Trick Room
item: Focus Sash
nature: Timid
ability: Prankster
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[Set Comments]
<p>Whimsicott is the fastest user of Tailwind and Encore in the whole tier. This makes it one of the best support Pokemon to have on an offensive team. Encore forces the repetition of non-damaging moves. This allows for free hits and more time to set up a strategy. Helping Hand powers up a teammate's attacks. Tailwind and Helping Hand gives a team a ridiculous advantage, effectively putting Whimsicott's partner at +2 Speed and +1 Attack or Special Attack. Trick Room is useful for reversing the opponent's Trick Room, which would otherwise nullify Tailwind.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>Occa Berry or Coba Berry is viable if Focus Sash is already held by another member of your team, since surviving an Acrobatics or Heat Wave is very satisfying. Sunny Day is an option for Chlorophyll-based teams. If Taunt appeals to you more than the other moves, it is definitely worth consideration. One major benefit of Taunt is that it stops Tornadus from using Tailwind and Amoonguss from using Spore.</p>

<p>Anything with middling Speed and high Attack or Special Attack is a good teammate for Whimsicott. Haxorus, Darmanitan, Hydreigon, and Chandelure love Tailwind's benefits, and provide a Heat Wave resistance for Whimsicott. All of those Pokemon are quite offensive and have moves with a large Base Power. Darmanitan and Chandelure especially love Sunny Day. It takes away their weakness to Water-type attacks and adds power to their strongest STAB attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Terrakion Partner
move 1: Beat Up
move 2: Tailwind
move 3: Charm
move 4: Helping Hand / Trick Room
item: Focus Sash
nature: Timid
ability: Prankster
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[Set Comments]
<p>This set focuses on abusing Terrakion's ability to quickly raise it to +4 Attack. This, along with Tailwind, will tear down unprepared teams. Charm lowers the Attack of threats like Conkeldurr and Scrafty before they can damage Terrakion. Trick Room can reverse the opponent's Trick Room while Terrakion safely uses Protect.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>The best way to execute this strategy would be to use Tailwind on Turn 1 while Terrakion uses Protect. Whimsicott can then use Beat Up on Terrakion on Turn 2. Helping Hand, on top of the boosts, can help Terrakion to KO Reuniclus and Amoonguss. Threats to Terrakion are susceptible to Charm, and Focus Sash users can be KOed by Whimsicott's Beat Up.</p>

<p>Terrakion is the best among the legendary bull trio to make use of Beat Up's Attack boosts. Virizion could work instead, but Terrakion gets the job done a lot better thanks to its strong spread attacks and better coverage. Cobalion does not have the typing or movepool to do anything as game-breaking as Terrakion.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSeed
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Encore / Taunt
move 4: Cotton Guard / Toxic
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
ability: Prankster
evs: 36 Def / 252 SpD / 220 Spe

[Set Comments]
<p>This has the potential to be the most dangerous (and rage-inducing) set. Substitute and Leech Seed have +1 priority thanks to Prankster. This means that Whimsicott's Leech Seed will hit every other Pokemon first. Encore allows Whimsicott to use Substitute, Cotton Guard, and Toxic repeatedly against Pokemon who use any non-damaging attack or Fake Out. After one Cotton Guard, Archeops' Acrobatics only 3HKOes Whimsicott. With two Cotton Guards under its belt, Whimsicott's Substitutes will almost never break from physical attacks.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>Double Team is another option to use in the 3rd or 4th moveslot. Less HP EVs are used to make sure that Leech Seed will heal back a larger percentage of Whimsicott's HP. The less HP EVs Whimsicott uses, the more times it can use Substitute. Leftovers increases HP recovery. In conjunction with Leech Seed, Leftovers also makes Whimsicott very difficult to take down. If you are concerned about Taunt from an opponent's Pokemon, consider using Mental Herb.</p>

<p>Subseed is a stalling strategy. When looking for teammates, keep in mind that defensively oriented Pokemon will work the best. Common methods for stall teams abuse moves like Swagger and Double Team. This set can't touch Amoonguss at all, so having a teammate that can is a must. Archeops, Tornadus, and Chandelure can quickly dispose of the mushroom with their strong STAB attacks. Mandibuzz is another fine choice. It provides ridiculous bulk and Brave Bird to handle Amoonguss.</p>

[SET]
Name: Lv. 1 Trick Room
Move 1: Trick Room
Move 2: Endeavor
Move 3: Encore
Move 4: Protect
Item: Focus Sash
Nature: Relaxed / Sassy
Ability: Prankster
IVs: 0 Spe

[Set Comments]
<p>Thanks to Sun Stone, Cottonee can evolve at level one. Whimsicott is the fastest Pokemon on the field once it gets up Trick Room. Endeavor will bring enemy Pokemon's HP down to an extremely low number. This means that a teammate can easily pick off weakened opponents. Encore still has a priority of +1 and helps tremendously against Pokemon that use Fake Out, Tailwind, and Protect.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>Helping Hand may be used in the last slot if you are just looking to quickly do as much damage as possible. However, Protect prevents priority moves from finishing off Whimsicott after Focus Sash's activation.</p>

<p>The best partner for this set is Scrafty. The lizard with pants gets Fake Out to help set up Trick Room. Scrafty also functions quite well in Trick Room, and quickly racks up Attack boosts (thanks to Moxie) with the help of Endeavor. Carracosta is another good partner. It can protect both Pokemon from spread attacks with Wide Guard, has a low base Speed, and a great ability that acts as a Focus Sash.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Running an EV spread of 252 HP / 36 SpD / 220 Spe is viable on any set. It adds a little bulk while maintaining the jump on Thundurus and Tornadus by 1 point. Fake Tears and Tickle are good options to break down defensive Pokemon. Fake Tears allows Hydreigon to spam Draco Meteor all day. Tickle is incredibly helpful against common physical attackers such as Conkeldurr and bulkier Pokemon like Amoonguss.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Pokemon that can OHKO Whimsicott make for the best counters possible. Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics from Tornadus or Archeops OHKOes Whimsicott. Chandelure's Overheat OHKOes Whimsicott as well, so predicting which item Whimsicott is holding determines how quickly you can KO it. Mienshao can slow down Whimsicott's strategy with Fake Out, but it must be wary of Encore. Musharna holding a Mental Herb can easily set up Trick Room when facing Whimsicott. Amoonguss with a Mental Herb can Spore Whimsicott. Amoonguss is also immune to Leech Seed and Toxic.</p>
