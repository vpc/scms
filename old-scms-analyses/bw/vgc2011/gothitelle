[Overview]
<p>Gothitelle is a fairly decent Pokemon; however it lacks many of the important traits it needs to compete with many of the other Psychic-types in the VGC 2011 metagame. Despite this, it provides a bit of originality and can offer some surprise factor. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gothitelle's best use in VGC is as a Trick Room starter. With fairly decent stats, Gothitelle takes many hits and dishes back some pain. Outside of Trick Room, however, Gothitelle can really fall short, so it's important to try and get it up quickly. Its bulkiness is what makes it somewhat useful, as this allows for it to take even super effective hits with ease and set up.</p>

<p>Gothitelle has decent enough coverage in order to make it a worthwhile try on any aspiring Trick Room team. With STAB Psychic, many of the common Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr fear it. Shadow Ball allows for coverage against Ghost-types who may threaten Gothitelle in certain situations. Protect is a golden move in VGC, allowing Gothitelle to not only scout its opponent's item with Frisk, but also take advantage of seeing one of its moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Gothitelle tends to be outclassed by both Reuniclus and Musharna. Reuniclus boasts a higher Special Attack and HP stats, as well as lower speed, making it a better candidate to set up and sweep. Musharna also is bulkier than Gothitelle, and has a higher Special Attack stat, which also makes it a stronger Trick Room starter. However, Gothitelle has more special bulk than both of them, allowing it to tank hits. It is also much less used, which can catch opponents off guard. Overall, Gothitelle doesn't have much to use to damage the opponent, which can leave it in a bad position in the game. More often than not, Gothitelle can be dead weight, but if supported right it can be a great set up Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gothitelle can also run an excellent support set. With access to both Reflect and Light Screen, Gothitelle, equipped with Light Clay, can set up screens that give your team the ability to tank hits. It also gets Rain Dance, which it can set up to help teammates who can take advantage of it. Gothitelle also has access to Thunder Wave and Toxic, which can harm opponents greatly throughout the match.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gothitelle's main counters are nearly anything that can resist both Psychic and Shadow Ball. Notable ones are Scrafty, Krookodile, and Hydreigon. Without proper support, Gothitelle will be totally walled by these powerful Pokemon. Its checks are bulkier Ghost-types as well as others who can shrug off Psychic and Shadow Ball. Jellicent, Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, and many of the commonly seen offensive Pokemon can bother Gothitelle. It also does not resist the very common move Heat Wave, Water Spout, Surf, Rock Slide, and Earthquake that are all around the VGC metagame.</p>
