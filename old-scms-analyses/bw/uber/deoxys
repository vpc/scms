[Overview]

<p>Deoxys has great offensive stats, but suffers from being the middle child of Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S, often struggling to not be outclassed by either one of the two. However, with its slight advantage in bulk over the frail Deoxys-A, this fallen comet manages to carve itself a niche (albeit a tiny and mostly useless one) as an offensive dual screens user.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sporting double the base defensive stats of Carvanha, Deoxys can semi-reliably set up dual screens for its team. Unlike Deoxys-A, Deoxys can actually survive certain attacks, making it a decent offensive dual screens user.</p>

<p>Light Screen and Reflect are fairly self-explanatory, providing a setup window for your sweepers. Psycho Boost is Deoxys's strongest STAB option, doing moderate damage to anything without huge Special Defense or a resistance to the attack. Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types super effectively without lowering Deoxys's Special Attack, but a neutral STAB Psycho Boost actually does more damage on the first use. Low Kick is the primary option for the last slot, threatening Tyranitar, Steel and Normal Arceus, Dialga, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Chansey and Blissey. Fire Punch can be used in the same slot to OHKO Ferrothorn and bring Forretress down to 1 HP.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The HP and Defense EVs ensure that Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus can't OHKO Deoxys with ExtremeSpeed, while the Attack EVs allow it to retaliate with an almost assured 2HKO from Low Kick. The Speed EVs allow Deoxys to outpace all neutral natured Choice Scarf users with a base Speed of 90 or below. The remaining 8 EVs are dumped into Special Attack to provide a bit of a kick to Psycho Boost and Ice Beam.</p>

<p>Grass Knot is an option over Psycho Boost or Ice Beam to smack Kyogre and Groudon really hard. Thunder still hits Kyogre for super effective damage, and has an added bonus of Lugia and Ho-Oh being susceptible to it as well. However, its unreliability outside of rain and this set's dedication to the lead slot make this an inferior option most of the time. Shadow Ball prevents Mewtwo from setting up, but is fairly useless outside of that.</p>

<p>Deoxys appreciates teammates that can take advantage of the screens it provides to set up and threaten the opposing team. Rock Polish + Swords Dance Groudon, Dragon Dance Rayquaza, and Extreme Killer Arceus are all examples of such Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Deoxys has a great movepool, but all of its choices will leave it outclassed by its alternate formes. It has access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, Magic Coat, ExtremeSpeed, and Taunt, all of which are useful, but unfortunately have as little a reason to be used as Deoxys itself.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak will 2HKO Deoxys, even if the second one is cushioned by Reflect, allowing it to only get one screen up or attack. Extreme Killer Arceus is 2HKOed by Deoxys, but ExtremeSpeed will 2HKO Deoxys back. Ghost Arceus can take anything Deoxys throws at it and set up Calm Minds, using Recover when necessary. Jirachi walls sets without Fire Punch and can paralyze Deoxys, then take it out with Iron Head. Ho-Oh and specially defensive Giratina also wall this set, but cannot stop Deoxys from setting up both screens. Metagross and Scizor are only hit super effectively by Fire Punch, and have powerful STAB moves and priority to take out Deoxys. Any Choice Scarf user with more than 279 Speed can swiftly knock Deoxys out with a STAB or super effective move before it has a chance to set up screens.</p>
