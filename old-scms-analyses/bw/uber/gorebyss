[Overview]

<p>It's no surprise that Shell Smash would be abused by Pokemon who get Baton Pass—and Gorebyss is no exception. Gorebyss gets a niche in Ubers over other Shell Smash users because of her wonderful ability, Swift Swim, which makes use of the most common weather in Ubers—rain. Her Water-type STAB also makes use of rain, boosting Surf and Hydro Pump by 50%. However, Gorebyss has no true defenses to speak of, and she receives very tough competition for Smeargle, who can use Spore in conjunction with Shell Smash and Baton Pass.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gorebyss is one of the best Baton Pass users in the tier, because with Shell Smash she only requires one turn of setup. The benefit she gets over Smeargle is her ability, Swift Swim. Rain is very common in Ubers, and not only does it double Gorebyss's Speed, but it also pumps up Surf's power. In rain, Gorebyss can outspeed and revenge kill Mewtwo and Pokemon slower than her, as she reaches 406 Speed. Shell Smash along with Baton Pass is a strategy that is very effective, and it is sometimes very hard to stop. Because Shell Smash boosts Attack, Special Attack, and Speed, once Gorebyss has Baton Passed to the appropriate sweeper, it's nearly guaranteed that your opponent will have a tough time against it. However, Gorebyss is very frail, so in order to get this strategy working Gorebyss must come in and out very quickly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice between White Herb and Life Orb is up to you; White Herb is the preferred option, as it cancels the defensive drops, putting the recipient at less risk. Life Orb, however, grants Gorebyss a lot of power. For Example, Hydro Pump in rain after a Shell Smash boost does 77.97% - 91.83% to standard defensive Dialga. Thus, Hydro Pump is a viable option over Surf if running Life Orb.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it's very important to scout the opponent's team before you send in Gorebyss. Gorebyss might Shell Smash for nothing and waste her only White Herb, ruining the sweep before it even begins. Kyogre is mandatory for the rain support, which gives Gorebyss her main niche over Smeargle. Wobbuffet is also a good partner, as it can Encore Pokemon and lock them into a non-threatening move such as Swords Dance or Stealth Rock, allowing Gorebyss to come in safely and Shell Smash up. If you wish to go the most offensive route, a Dual Screener such as Latios or Deoxys-S is recommended so that Gorebyss can set up on a broader range of targets.</p>

<p>Groudon is a big annoyance to Gorebyss, as it takes away rain and her Swift Swim boost with it. Mixed Rayquaza can lure in Groudon and Lugia, two common phazers in Ubers, and OHKO Groudon with Draco Meteor, while Lugia will take a lot of damage from it. Dialga is an amazing recipient because it is very versatile. Additionally, Dialga resists ExtremeSpeed and Shadow Sneak, two of the most common priority moves in Ubers. Other good recipients are bulky Pokemon with a wide coverage, such as Groudon, Zekrom, or Mewtwo. Gorebyss can be used to pass boosts to set-up sweepers, such as Mewtwo, to make their sweep easier. Gorebyss can usually only pull off a Baton Pass once due to her reliance on White Herb, so things that will limit Gorebyss's lifespan should be removed, such as Toxic Spikes. Fast Taunt users, such as Deoxys-S and Thundurus, or Rapid Spinners, such as Tentacruel, Forretress, and Excadrill, excel at keeping Toxic Spikes off the field.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gorebyss doesn't really have any other options. Gorebyss can only land some damage with Surf or Hydro Pump, and Ice Beam. Gorebyss should never invest in any defense, as Gorebyss's defenses are pathetic by Ubers standards.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The first step in countering Gorebyss is removing rain. Groudon is the best option since sun weakens Gorebyss's STAB moves, but Tyranitar and Hippowdon are also options. Gorebyss is very frail, so hitting hard and hitting fast should do the job. Priority users, such as Arceus and Giratina-O, can bypass Gorebyss's boosts and strike very hard, with or without the Defense drop. Dialga, defensive Kyogre, and Giratina-O can phaze Gorebyss with Dragon Tail or Roar, respectively. Kyogre gets the bonus of resisting all of Gorebyss's moves, and Dialga can tank them due to its bulk. Gorebyss can only Baton Pass once without Defense drops, so if you can scare her out, then you have probably avoided the worst.</p>
