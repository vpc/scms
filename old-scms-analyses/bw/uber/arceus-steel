[Overview]

<p>Clad in His steel armor, Arceus enters the battlefield ready to deliver His divine Judgment on His creations. Steel Arceus laughs at the horde of elemental moves that fail to pierce His impenetrable armor. Even the fangs of the mighty Dragon-types, whom He created to protect the world, fail to leave a scratch on Arceus's polished exterior. Although, Steel Arceus dislikes the quakes of the earth and the raging fires, one should never overlook Him, for truly no other forme of the Creator is as resilient as He.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its impressive defenses and wide array of resistances thanks to its Steel typing, Steel Arceus can pull off a Calm Mind set without breaking a sweat. Access to Recover prevents Arceus from being taken down easily, and even allows it to wall Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Palkia after a few Calm Mind boosts. Steel has decent coverage in Ubers, but is resisted by Water- and Fire-types, which are fairly common. Roar can be used to phaze out opposing setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Dialga before they get out of control, and racks up passive damage when used alongside entry hazards. Thunder can be used to deal with Pokemon who resist Steel-type attacks, such as Kyogre, but it is not recommended unless rain support from Kyogre can be provided. Will-O-Wisp allows Arceus to cripple physical attackers such as Zekrom and works very well thanks to Arceus's excellent Speed. The combination of Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp makes Steel Arceus very hard to take out. Thanks to Steel Arceus's immunity to Toxic and access to Recover, it can function as a deadly stallbreaker capable of defeating stalling machines such as Blissey one-on-one.</p>

<p>The EVs are designed to grant Arceus maximum bulk, while also giving it enough Speed to tie with other offensive variants of Arceus. Speed and HP EVs can be transferred to Special Attack if immediate firepower is preferred over durability; 116 EVs with a neutral nature is the absolute minimum Speed you should run with Steel Arceus, though, so it can still outspeed Garchomp. 168 Speed EVs is probably preferred though as it allows Steel Arceus to outspeed all non-Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Kyurem-W, and Rayquaza, which can be invaluable especially considering Steel Arceus is already a good check to both. A fully defensive EV set can be run by moving the Speed EVs into Defense and using a Bold nature.</p>

<p>Kyogre makes a fantastic partner to Steel Arceus thanks to its ability to check Groudon. The rain Kyogre brings along also negates Steel Arceus's weakness to Fire-type moves, and allows it to wield a perfectly accurate Thunder. Kyogre can also check most variants of Reshiram and Ho-Oh, both of whom pose a huge threat to Steel Arceus. Steel Arceus pairs up well with almost any Dragon-type as it can take Ice- and Dragon-type hits for them, while they can take Fire-, Water-, Electric-, and usually even Ground-type moves for it. Rayquaza deserves a special mention because it is immune to Earthquake and has excellent synergy with Steel Arceus on the whole.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a great choice for a supportive Pokemon. While it might lack the Leftovers recovery that other Steel-types—such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Skarmory—offer, Steel Arceus's superior stats and wider movepool set it apart. In fact, it is both the fastest and specially bulkiest Steel-type in Ubers. </p>

<p>Steel Arceus is one of the few Steel-type Pokemon to learn Will-O-Wisp, so it's a given on a defensive set, as it allows Steel Arceus to cripple most physical attackers. Note that this isn't a sure-fire way to cripple Normal Arceus, as Will-O-Wisp's shaky accuracy can result in it taking heavy damage from a Swords Dance-boosted Normal Arceus. However, because most Normal Arceus don't run maximum Speed, Steel Arceus can act as an emergency check to it if your team is running out of options to deal with it.</p>

<p>Recover is the other major jewel in Steel Arceus's crown, ensuring that unlike most other Steel-types, it isn't forced to rely on Wish, Rest, or other less reliable methods of healing. Steel Arceus's longevity also makes it a great phazer. Roar is the reliable and immediate option for phazing, while Perish Song is a slower, more risky method that has the advantage of dooming the last Pokemon standing, but Roar is far more reliable in most situations. When it comes to offensive options, Ice Beam is the prime choice, as it allows Steel Arceus to damage a wide variety of Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Rayquaza and Landorus, and also deals good damage to Groudon, Giratina-O, and Zekrom. Judgment's coverage isn't nearly as good, but it hits Kyurem-W, Terrakion, and Tyranitar super-effectively, while also being stronger than Ice Beam against neutral targets. Kyurem-W in particular can actually defeat Steel Arceus that don't run Judgment with Fusion Flare, Focus Blast, or Earth Power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Steel Arceus has a few other options up its sleeve, but finding moves to replace is tough, as removing Will-O-Wisp or its phazing move lessens Steel Arceus's utility and replacing its attacking move makes Steel Arceus even bigger Taunt bait. Stealth Rock is an option if your team is desperate to fit in the entry hazard, while Toxic allows Steel Arceus to cripple Ho-Oh switch-ins and dangerous Calm Mind users. If your team is extremely weak to Ho-Oh, Steel Arceus also has the more direct option of running Stone Edge. Finally, Magic Coat prevents Ferrothorn and other Spikers from setting up hazards and can surprise Deoxys-S leads (though note that Fire Punch 4HKOes Steel Arceus outside of rain).</p>

<p>The Speed investment lets Steel Arceus tie with offensive Arceus formes, but if you prefer a bulkier set and don't mind losing a little bit of Speed, you can run anywhere from 176 Speed EVs and a Timid nature to outspeed Latias and Latios, or a Calm or Bold nature with 168 Speed EVs to outspeed Rayquaza and Kyurem-W.</p>

<p>Because Steel Arceus is such a great phazer, it's only natural that Spikes users such as the Deoxys formes, Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory make good choices as teammates, despite the typing redundancies. However, Steel Arceus itself is very vulnerable to being set up on by hazard setters, so spinners such as Forretress, Tentacruel, Excadrill, and Kabutops are good teammates. There is always the riskier option of Espeon or Xatu to block hazards from going up; of the two, the former is preferred due to its decent offensive stats.</p>

<p>Steel Arceus has serious problems with several common Pokemon on sun teams, including Ho-Oh, Kyurem-W (when not using Judgment), and Reshiram; the threat of other dangerous special attackers such as Ground Arceus, Fighting Arceus, and Kyogre make it important to also cover Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks. All of this makes Kyogre an excellent teammate. Not only does Kyogre nullify Steel Arceus's weaknesses to sun teams with Drizzle, it can also use Fighting Arceus and Ground Arceus as platforms to launch its torrential assault. In return, Steel Arceus does a good job of checking Latias for Kyogre. Just be warned, however, that even bulky Kyogre will take a lot from Ho-Oh's Brave Bird. When it comes to typing synergy, floating Dragon-types with Levitate—such as Giratina-O and Latias—partner well with Steel Arceus, as they are resistant or immune to all of its weaknesses while Steel Arceus covers theirs.</p> 

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Steel-type STAB is admittedly not the best in Ubers, with many of the common Pokemon in the tier—most notably Kyogre—resisting it, Steel Arceus can still be a potent user of Swords Dance. After a Swords Dance, Arceus's Attack stat hits a magnificent 678. Iron Head provides a reliable STAB move, and its 30% flinch chance is icing on the cake. Earthquake has excellent neutral coverage in Ubers in tandem with Iron Head, being resisted by only a handful of Pokemon. ExtremeSpeed can be used over Earthquake to deal with faster sweepers such as Mewtwo, but it is not nearly as powerful as Earthquake. In the last slot, Recover allows Arceus to make full use of its bulk, and gives it plenty of opportunities to set up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A more defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Speed can be used to give Arceus some staying power. Outrage can be used to destroy the plethora of Dragon-types in Ubers, but a Steel Arceus locked into Outrage is easy to revenge kill.</p>

<p>As opposing support Groudon have a field day with this set, offensive variants of Kyogre and Palkia are great teammates. Just like the previous set, most Dragon-types make good teammates for Steel Arceus as they resist most of each other's weaknesses. However, one must be cautious about pairing Dialga or Zekrom with Steel Arceus, as it compounds the team's weakness to Ground.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Arceus's extensive movepool grants it no dearth of options. Cosmic Power can be used to boost both of Arceus's defensive stats, and works well with Steel Arceus's numerous resistances. Perish Song lets Arceus defeat late-game sweepers such as Kyogre and Dark Arceus, and can create a setup opportunity for a teammate such as Rayquaza. Earth Power puts a dent in Heatran, but has no real use otherwise.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Pokemon capable of dishing out powerful Fire-, Fighting-, or Ground-type attacks is a threat to Steel Arceus. Ho-Oh, Reshiram, and Groudon can all obliterate Steel Arceus with their STAB moves; the latter is especially dangerous as the sunlight it summons powers up the Fire-type moves that Steel Arceus hates. Heatran can switch on Will-O-Wisp, grab a Flash Fire boost, and do a large chunk of damage with Flamethrower. If the sun is up, Mewtwo can fry Steel Arceus with Fire Blast, which easily OHKOes. Kyogre, Ground Arceus, Fire Arceus, and Fighting Arceus can all engage in a Calm Mind war with Steel Arceus and eventually win thanks to their natural type advantage. Garchomp and Terrakion can turn Steel Arceus to scrap metal with their powerful STAB moves, but they cannot switch in. Choice Scarf Heracross, although rare, can outspeed Steel Arceus and even stomach an unboosted Judgment if it needs to; in return, it has no problem bringing Steel Arceus down with its STAB Close Combat. Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn can be a nuisance to the Swords Dance set; Skarmory in particular laughs at all of Steel Arceus's moves and can phaze it out with Whirlwind.</p>
