[Overview]

<p>Deoxys-D's select movepool and defensive capabilities enable it to set up entry hazards against a variety of Uber threats. With access to Taunt, not much barring Magic Bounce Pokemon and Whimsicott can stop this defensive behemoth from withering the opposition away with poison, or littering the opponent's field with entry hazards. However, Deoxys-D does have its flaws. Its low base 50 HP stat restricts its bulk, which unfortunately makes it yet another creature that is OHKOed by the sheer power of Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout and Choice Specs Reshiram's sun-boosted Blue Flare. This, combined with its average base 90 Speed stat, makes it difficult for Deoxys-D to keep up with the competition, namely Ferrothorn for its role as a bulky Spikes user. Regardless of these shortcomings, Deoxys-D still makes a great support Pokemon that should not be forgotten, lest you wish to be walled by the alien.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Deoxys-D's wide movepool and solid defensive capabilities enable it to easily poison the opposition and prevent them from using any healing moves with Taunt. With an Agility boost, Deoxys-D can easily outspeed and Taunt any foes attempting to Trick or Taunt it. Taunt is the crux of the set, as it prevents foes from setting up or Taunting Deoxys-D, and removes any hope that the opposition has of alleviating their team's suffering to poison. Nothing that carries Taunt will be able to outspeed Deoxys-D after an Agility, but it can still be foiled by the few devious Pokemon with the Prankster ability who bypass Speed entirely. Lastly, Recover allows Deoxys-D to heal itself of any wounds that the opposition might have desperately caused in an attempt to end the torture that the alien has enacted upon them.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread is designed so that Deoxys-D can outspeed all Deoxys-S after an Agility. If you wish to further safeguard Deoxys-D from being Tricked a Choice Scarf, then an alternate spread of 252 HP / 24 SpD / 228 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed all base 130 Pokemon carrying a Choice Scarf after an Agility boost. If one wants to focus more on Deoxys-D's walling capabilities and does not care about the possibility of being Taunted or Tricked after an Agility, then he can opt to use the more defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature to maximize Deoxys-D's walling potential.</p>

<p>Though its defenses are mighty, Deoxys-D simply cannot withstand Kyogre's Water Spout or Reshiram's Blue Flare. In order to lengthen its life span, the alien greatly appreciates teammates that can absorb these mighty blows. Chansey deserves a special mention as it can pass Wishes that will heal 100% of Deoxys-D's health. Gastrodon and Palkia are very useful partners as both easily absorb those blows regardless of whether the opponent holds Choice Specs or not.</p>

<p>Deoxys-D has a tendency to cause its foes to retreat in fear after they have been poisoned, and this makes entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, very useful for Deoxys-D as it increases the amounts of residual damage that its victims suffer. This makes teammates such as Forretress and Ferrothorn great options to use in conjunction with Deoxys-D, as their typing and defensive capabilities enable the two to set up hazards with ease. The former deserves a special mention as it is also capable of spinning away pesky hazards—Toxic Spikes in particular—as they can prove to be a great nuisance to the alien. As Deoxys-D does not possess a Ghost typing, it unfortunately cannot spinblock, so it will be of use to pair it with a spinblocker. Giratina-O distinguishes itself from other spinblockers as it can easily OHKO Forretress with Hidden Power Fire, while wreaking havoc with Dragon Tail should the bug dare try to escape the renegade's wrath.</p>

<p>Finally, Deoxys-D cannot handle Xatu or Whimsicott due to their abilities. The former has the ability to bounce back all of Deoxys-D's non-attacking moves, while the latter can Taunt or Encore Deoxys-D into a support move before it can Taunt Whimsicott, courtesy of its Prankster ability. As a result, Deoxys-D appreciates partners that can swiftly eliminate these foes. In the long list of possible partners, Shaymin-S shines brightly, feared for its talents which allow it to be a fabulous quick stall abuser, capable of not only beating Deoxys-D's enemies, but creating free stall turns for Toxic to slowly intensify with the use of the flinch-mad move, Air Slash.</p>

[SET]
name: Utility Wall
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Recover
move 3: Magic Coat / Seismic Toss
move 4: Taunt / Knock Off
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Deoxys-D's arsenal of support moves in conjunction with great defenses and a reliable recovery move lets it distinguish itself from Ferrothorn as a very bulky Spikes user. Unlike Ferrothorn, however, Deoxys-D does not carry a weakness to Fire-type attacks, and can easily heal its wounds mid-game rather than having to rely on Leech Seed. Spikes is a fantastic move, and supplies the team with entry hazard support. Deoxys-D can increase its longevity with clever use of Recover and Taunt. The choice for the third moveslot depends on the team's needs; if you do not want Deoxys-D to be forced to switch upon being Taunted, then you can opt to use Seismic Toss. Alternatively, Magic Coat allows Deoxys-D to reflect Taunt, entry hazards, and status back at the opposition, but it generally requires very good prediction. Knock Off allows Deoxys-D to take full advantage of its defenses and deprive the opposition of their items, but its lack of power often makes it setup bait for the opposition.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stealth Rock can be used over any of Deoxys-D's other moves on the set if needed. If Deoxys-D forgoes Seismic Toss or Knock Off for Stealth Rock, Deoxys-D loses the ability to damage setup sweepers, and is prone to becoming setup fodder. If Stealth Rock is used over Magic Coat or Taunt, it risks becoming Taunt bait for the enemy. Stealth Rock can be used instead of Spikes as a decent alternative, but the solid 25% damage to all grounded sweepers is arguably more reliable. Dropping Recover for Stealth Rock drastically reduces Deoxys-D's longevity, and is never recommended.</p>

<p>Deoxys-D cannot handle Xatu, Whimsicott (if it is not carrying Magic Coat), Kyogre, or Reshiram, so it greatly appreciates the assistance of teammates that can. Deoxys-D also likes teammates that can take advantage of its hazards and bulk. Frail sweepers, such as Rayquaza, appreciate the hazards Deoxys-D provides and can use the alien as cover when the opposition sends in a check or counter. Lastly, Deoxys-D appreciates spinblocker support so that all its hard work does not get spun away. Giratina-O distinguishes itself from the crowd as it, unlike other spinblockers, can demolish the spinning foes with a Draco Meteor, and call upon the alien to take its place on the battlefield when its power weakens.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Deoxys-D's usable attacking stats and great defensive stats might make it seem like a great user of Calm Mind and Cosmic Power, but sadly, any set utilizing them either falls victim to Taunt or status very easily, and makes poor use of Deoxys-D's wonderful support movepool. Deoxys-D can easily utilize dual screens thanks to its bulk and access to Taunt, which enables it to shut down any curious Wobbuffet and prevents it from being setup bait for the opposition. Lastly, a physically defensive spread consisting of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be utilized on any set, but a mixed defensive set is preferable due to the common nature of powerful special attacks flung around in the Uber environment, and Deoxys-D's lackluster typing for a physical wall.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Although the alien's defenses transcend those of the legendary Arceus, its HP stat does not get granted a fate as desirable as its defenses. Due to this unfortunate circumstance, Deoxys-D experiences difficulty taking blows from Ubers who have their mythical powers amplified by Choice Specs or Choice Band, as their attacks will surely 2HKO the alien if it dares try to wall them. Kyogre and Reshiram deserve a special mention due to the fact that their mighty powers, boosted by Choice Specs, will OHKO the unsuspecting alien in a heartbeat, leaving the user dazed and mystified.</p>

<p>Sadly, these are not the only problems that the alien faces. Deoxys-D cannot bear to be Taunted, Encored, or locked into a support move via Trick. Combine this with its average base 90 Speed and you have Choice Scarf users with Trick that are able to outspeed Deoxys-D even after an Agility boost, and force an unwanted Scarf upon the alien, making them very effective counters. Whimsicott also deserves a special mention, as its access to priority Taunt and Encore force the alien to either struggle or flee. As Deoxys-D tends to use only support moves, Xatu also deserves a special mention, as the bird can reflect all of its moves back at it and fear nothing in return. Sadly, the bird can do little to the alien if it lacks Toxic.</p>

<p>Lastly, should one happen to equip their Pokemon with a Mental Herb and Toxic, they will be able to bypass Deoxys-D's futile attempts to Taunt them and effectively cripple Deoxys-D permanently. In a similar sense, Deoxys-D is doomed if it switches in with Toxic Spikes at its feet, as it will never be able to cure the poison that will plague it for the rest of the match.</p>
