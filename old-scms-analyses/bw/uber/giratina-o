[Overview]

<p>Giratina-O's titanic base 150 HP, in conjunction with its decent base 100 defenses, grant it enough bulk to switch into attacks repeatedly. Levitate makes this even easier, as it allows Giratina-O to avoid Toxic Spikes and Spikes and act as its team's Ground-type immunity. Offensively, Giratina-O can cause serious amounts of damage with its amazing base 120 offenses, access to very powerful STAB moves such as Draco Meteor and Outrage, and a priority move in Shadow Sneak. But Giratina-O's most powerful utility comes with its Ghost / Dragon typing, which grants it many resistances and immunities, gives STAB to powerful moves, and allows it to function as a spinblocker. However, Giratina-O is not without its flaws. It has weaknesses to common Ice-, Dragon-, Dark-, and Ghost-type attacks, and can only hold the Griseous Orb. Its average base 90 Speed also leaves it outsped by a large number of threats, and the lack of Choice Scarf leaves it with no way to reliably boost its Speed without resorting to the weak and gimmicky Bulldoze to decrease its opponent's Speed. However, the aforementioned traits are more than enough to make Giratina-O a monster offensively and defensively, and of course, one of the best spinblockers in the game.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>Thanks to its STABs, high offensive stats, and the boost from Griseous Orb, Giratina-O is a deadly mixed attacker. It may not be as powerful as Dialga or Rayquaza, but its typing and bulk set it apart. Draco Meteor is Giratina-O's strongest attack and will leave huge dents on anything that does not resist it, bar Blissey and Eviolite Chansey. Shadow Sneak appears weak at first, but it allows Giratina-O to pick off weakened sweepers. Among the most notable are Mewtwo and Ghost Arceus, as they are both weak to it. Dragon Tail allows it to phaze enemies around to rack up damage with entry hazards and make setting up on Giratina-O extremely difficult. Combined with STAB, Giratina-O's naturally high Attack, and Griseous Orb boost, it will often leave a fair-sized dent in most Pokemon. The last slot allows Giratina-O to fulfill its spinblocking role effectively. Hidden Power Fire is specifically targeted at Forretress, but also grants it important coverage against Ferrothorn and Excadrill, provided that the weather is not rainy. However, its reliance on sunlight can be problematic. Giratina-O is more than capable of hurting Forretress even in rain, but Excadrill and Ferrothorn are able to swallow the attack without much of a problem. Should you find yourself running into more issues with Tentacruel and Excadrill, Earthquake is a solid replacement. It can also deal a sizable chunk to Tyranitar and Dialga. However, Giratina-O loses coverage against Ferrothorn and Forretress, allowing them to set up Spikes. If dealing immediate damage to Rapid Spinners isn't a concern, Will-O-Wisp can be used to generally cripple physically oriented Pokemon such as Swords Dance Ground Arceus and Tyranitar.</p>

<p>It is possible to run both Hidden Power and Earthquake to maximize coverage against the Rapid Spinners, but sacrificing one of the three other moves in the set can be tremendously crippling. As far as its Dragon STAB moves go, by dropping Draco Meteor Giratina-O loses a direct way of dealing quick damage and the ability to hurt Groudon, while forgoing Dragon Tail means that it can no longer truly abuse the entry hazards it spinblocks and leaves it open to being set up on. Forgetting Shadow Sneak deprives it of the ability to revenge kill Deoxys-A, Mewtwo (at 50%), and other weakened threats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Unlike what is normally expected on mixed attackers, Giratina-O's EVs maximize its offenses instead of its Speed. This is because Giratina-O is already one of the slowest Pokemon in Ubers, and thanks to Hidden Power Fire requiring a 30 Speed IV, Giratina-O cannot even Speed tie with Pokemon with base 90 Speed. However, Giratina-O should not run a Speed-dropping nature, such as Brave, as it would be unable to outspeed defensive base 90s without any investment in Speed, such as Groudon and Kyogre. If the Speed EVs are insufficient, you may drop some from either offensive stat and invest more in Speed. Naive and Hasty are also options to boost Giratina-O's Speed. With at least 244 Speed EVs, Giratina-O can outrun Excadrill when sandstorm is not raging. Giratina-O can also run Defense EVs instead of Special Attack to make it a great emergency check to the likes of Swords Dance Arceus, Groudon, and Blaziken. For instance, with max Defense, Giratina-O will always survive max Attack Adamant +2 Life Orb-boosted Shadow Claw from Arceus and Blaziken after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Giratina-O absolutely loves entry hazard support, perhaps more than any other Pokemon due to its ability to block Rapid Spin and its tendency to wreak havoc with Dragon Tail. Forretress, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Deoxys-S are all able to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes. Forretress in particular is a great choice, as it can lay down Toxic Spikes and has great defensive synergy with Giratina-O. Groudon, Dialga, and some Arceus variants are great at setting up Stealth Rock and providing defensive backup. Since Giratina-O lacks recovery, Wish support is helpful. Blissey can sponge special attacks (particularly Draco Meteor) aimed at Giratina-O and act as a Wish-passer. Jirachi has great defensive synergy with Giratina-O, but Giratina-O's massive HP stat means Jirachi's Wish won't heal as much.</p>

[SET] 
name: SubCM
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Dragon Pulse / Shadow Ball
move 4: Aura Sphere / Shadow Ball / Thunder
item: Griseous Orb
nature: Modest
evs: 212 HP / 72 Def / 224 SpA 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Giratina-O's Speed may not be appealing, Giratina-O can still attempt a sweep via Calm Mind due to its excellent bulk and reasonably powerful attacks. What makes this set dangerous is Giratina-O's Ghost / Dragon typing and access to Levitate, which grant it crucial immunities to Seismic Toss, Rapid Spin, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. These traits allow it to set up Calm Mind with relative ease against stall teams and use Substitute to render Blissey or Chansey useless.</p>

<p>It's recommended to have Dragon Pulse as Giratina-O's main attack, due to its amazing neutral coverage; it also hits a myriad of Pokemon in Ubers super effectively. However, Shadow Ball allows Giratina-O to deal significant amounts of damage to Mewtwo, Mew, Wobbuffet, and most importantly, Lugia, who could otherwise wall it to an extent. Whichever move you choose, Aura Sphere complements the coverage, hitting Pokemon such as Steel Arceus, Heatran, Dialga, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Thunder should only be used with Dragon Pulse for the best coverage. It hits Forretress, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh harder than any of its other moves and deals a decent amount to Lugia. However, rain support is needed to ensure that it never misses. Finally, you can use both of Giratina-O's STAB attacks to hit many Ubers super effectively, sacrificing general neutral coverage in the process. Be warned, however, that Ferrothorn can defeat Giratina-O without Aura Sphere.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Fire may be used to cut through Forretress and Ferrothorn in the sun. The combination of Hidden Power Fire and Dragon Pulse is only resisted by Heatran. The EV spread allows Giratina-O to survive Choice Scarf Garchomp's Outrage and Choice Scarf Palkia's Spacial Rend after Stealth Rock damage. The rest are thrown into Special Attack to power up its attacks. However, if being slow and defensive does not suit you well, you can use a Timid nature and maximize Speed and Attack. </p>

<p>Like the previous set, Giratina-O appreciates Steel-type teammates and entry hazard support. It's also fortunate that most of the viable Spikes-laying Pokemon in the Uber metagame are Steel-type. Wish support is highly recommended to keep Giratina-O at high health so that it can have more chances at pulling off a successful sweep, so Jirachi, Blissey, and Chansey work well as partners. There aren't a whole lot of counters for this set, because Giratina-O can take just about any special attack with a Calm Mind and inflict massive damage back. However, it suffers from being limited to two attacks. Lugia and Ghost Arceus can take on those without Shadow Ball, while Dragon-types such as Palkia and Zekrom pose problems to those without Dragon Pulse. Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Heatran also annoy those without Aura Sphere.</p>

[SET]
name: Sleeping Beauty (Mono-Attacker)
move 1: Rest

move 4: Dragon Pulse
item: Griseous Orb
nature: Modest
evs: 104 HP / 252 Def / 148 SpA / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Rest and Sleep Talk, Giratina-O is bothered by neither Tentacruel's Scald burns nor Toxic from foes such as Blissey, Chansey, and Forretress; unlike the Substitute + Calm Mind set, this set can switch in more comfortably. Due to the huge boost in lifespan that Rest and Sleep Talk provide, this set makes an extremely efficient spinblocker, and because of Levitate, it outclasses Giratina, which is worn down by Spikes. This set is also extremely surprising; most people will think that it is the SubCM set and send in their defensive non-Ghost Arceus or Lugia, both of which cannot do anything but phaze. Power is also another huge advantage over Giratina. For example, at +1 Special Attack, Giratina-O will always 2HKO 252 HP / 200 SpD Dialga after Stealth Rock damage (while Dialga's Draco Meteor never OHKOes). Moreover, Giratina-O is not shut down by Trick, which is simply nullified; Giratina, on the other hand, is completely useless once Trick is used on it. This set is also capable of defeating mono-attacker Kyogre, winning the Calm Mind war due to its typing. This is something Calm Mind Arceus cannot accomplish.</p>

<p>Rest and Sleep Talk provide recovery and allow Giratina-O to absorb status, while Calm Mind transforms Giratina-O into a great attacker. Calm Mind also boosts its Special Defense, which rounds out it bulk and makes it quite hard to take down with both physical and special attacks. Dragon Pulse is a great STAB move to have, resisted only by Steel-types and hitting the vast amount of Dragon-type Pokemon in Ubers for super effective damage; it also gets a boost from Griseous Orb.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>104 HP and 252 Defense EVs grant Giratina-O great physical bulk; in fact, it is bulkier than max HP Arceus. Moreover, these EVs ensure that Choice Scarf Zekrom's Outrage will never OHKO Giratina-O, even after Stealth Rock damage (tops at 87.36%). 148 EVs invested in Special Attack, in conjunction with a Modest nature, allow Giratina-O to 2HKO 252 HP / 200 SpD Dialga with a +1 Dragon Pulse after Stealth Rock damage. 4 Speed EVs are filler, but allow Giratina-O to outpace neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Dialga, Groudon, and Kyogre.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is needed in order to ensure some OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the aforementioned 2HKO on defensive Dialga. Groudon and Dialga are prime candidates for that role. The former is especially good, as it can take on Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Salamence, all of which threaten this set with their physical Dragon-type STAB moves. Ho-Oh is also a good partner, as it can defeat the various variations of Calm Mind Arceus that can defeat this set, such as Ghost Arceus. Ho-Oh also beats the Steel-types that use this set as setup fodder for entry hazards. Therefore, a Rapid Spin user of your own is recommended, such as Forretress or Tentacruel. These two Pokemon can also lay down more hazards—Spikes and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support is also highly recommended in case you need to wake Giratina-O up, as switching it out will reset its sleep counter. This makes it harder for it to do its job, as it cannot heal while it is asleep. Blissey and Chansey are remarkable partners that can fill this position, as they can also defeat Calm Mind Arceus.</p>

<p>This set has a harder time against Steel-types; this variant, unlike mixed Giratina-O, lacks both Thunder for Skarmory and Hidden Power Fire for Forretress and Ferrothorn. Giratina-O will eventually beat them, but they will be able to set up entry hazards in the meantime. Ferrothorn is the biggest annoyance, because with Leech Seed, Gyro Ball 3HKOes with ease, though Ferrothorn must be wary of Gyro Ball's low PP; the rare Curse variants will also win most of the time. Both Scizor and Metagross strike extremely hard with Pursuit, Bullet Punch, or Meteor Mash, leaving Giratina-O no chance to Rest up. Any Calm Mind Arceus, bar of Grass and Ground variants, sets up easily on this set due to its high special bulk, and beats it with STAB Judgment and Recover. Calm Mind Lugia is also in the same boat, packing a super effective Ice Beam and Whirlwind to phaze Giratina-O away, resetting its sleep counter. Tyranitar is bulky enough in sand to take a few Dragon Pulses, and can strike back with Payback, Crunch, or trap with Pursuit.</p>

<p>Rayquaza, Salamence, Choice Band Zekrom, and Choice Band Garchomp can still OHKO Giratina-O (Salamence has only an 81.25% chance to OHKO though), but they cannot switch in safely due to Dragon Pulse. Ho-Oh's huge base Special Defense allows it to tank a few Dragon Pulses (+1 Dragon Pulse 3HKOes), Roost off the damage, and 3HKO back with Brave Bird, but it needs to be wary of recoil and Stealth Rock damage. Jirachi's Iron Head does only 14.8% - 17.6%, whereas +1 Dragon Pulse does 23% - 27.5%, so it needs massive amounts of hax to beat Giratina-O. (The Toxic stuff is Checks and Counters material IMO) Chansey only has a 21.48% chance to be 2HKOed by a +6 Dragon Pulse, but cannot do anything in return to Giratina-O. Phazing can be problematic for this set, as the forced switch will reset Giratina-O's sleep counter.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>SpikeStacking is one of the most threatening and dangerous playstyles in Ubers, and this set is an amazing addition to this playstyle by being able to spinblock and shuffle. This set has a few advantages over Giratina, which is often considered one of the best spinblockers in the metagame. Firstly, Giratina-O is much more powerful than Giratina; Giratina-O's Dragon Tail will almost always break 208/0 Ho-Oh's Substitute, while Giratina struggles to do the same. Moreover, in contrast to Giratina, who is worn down easily by Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Giratina-O's Levitate ability allows it to hover over these entry hazards, avoiding the additional damage.</p>

<p>Giratina-O makes a wonderful stallbreaker due to its spinblocking capability, its Dragon-type STAB, and the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk. This is Giratina-O's only way to heal HP and cure status, which further allows it to fulfill its job as a spinblocker. The use of both Dragon Tail and Roar might seem like a waste of a moveslot, but if using Sleep Talk, Giratina-O has a 66.66% chance to phaze the opponent with either one. Roar is also capable of phazing Substitute users, whereas Dragon Tail can land a bit of damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Impish nature in conjunction with the provided EV spread maximizes Giratina-O's physical bulk, allowing it to take on physical threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Ho-Oh, Excadrill, and Groudon, while taking minimum residual damage from weather and Stealth Rock. 8 Speed EVs also allow Giratina-O to outpace Giratina and Groudon and phaze them before they get the chance to do the same.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock and Spikes are necessities for this set's success, as they allow Giratina-O to stack up damage with Roar and Dragon Tail. Groudon and Dialga are prime examples for teammates that can lay down Stealth Rock, whereas Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress synergize very well with Giratina-O and can also set up Spikes. Cleric support is advised as Giratina-O's sleep counter will be set back to zero once it switches out, making its job slightly harder. Therefore, Blissey and Chansey make great teammates, as they can sponge the special attacks aimed at Giratina-O, and vice versa. Steel-types, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress, will often attempt to lay down entry hazards on a sleeping Giratina-O, so having a Rapid Spin user such as Forretress or Tentacruel is also recommended.</p>

<p>Strong Dragon-type moves, such as Outrage and Draco Meteor, easily KO Giratina-O; in particular, Palkia, Rayquaza, and Dialga are extremely problematic. Darkrai and Dark Arceus can gamble against the odds of Sleep Talk and set up on Giratina-O, or simply OHKO with their super effective Dark-type STAB moves. Lugia is faster than Giratina-O and can set up Reflect, use Ice Beam, or phaze Giratina-O before Giratina-O has a chance to phaze it. However, Roar's priority is +0 if selected by Sleep Talk, so a sleeping Giratina-O might be able to phaze Lugia before being phazed itself. As mentioned above, Steel-types will gleefully set up entry hazards on this set. The most problematic ones are Taunt Skarmory and Leech Seed Ferrothorn, as both are able to cripple Giratina-O with ease. Therefore, Heatran makes a solid partner, as it can take Dragon-type attacks aimed at Giratina-O, defeat Lugia and Dark Arceus with Taunt and Toxic, and beat the Steel-types with its Fire STAB. Scizor is also a good partner, because it boasts perfect synergy with Giratina-O and can defeat the aforementioned counters with Roost.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Giratina-O is vulnerable to status. However, unlike the SubCM set, this Giratina-O makes use of Substitute and Dragon Tail to phaze and shuffle the opponent's Pokemon, all while behind the safety of its Rhydon doll. Like the mixed attacker set, this set can also check Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak. Earthquake hits the increasingly popular Mold Breaker Excadrill, whom you conveniently outspeed, Dialga, the odd Heatran, and Tentacruel, all for super effective damage.</p>

<p>Outrage can also be used in the last slot, as it is strongest attack Giratina-O can wield; Outrage is also the only attack that Ho-Oh fears. Will-O-Wisp is usable but recommended with a bulkier spread, such as 164 HP / 252 Def / 8 SDef / 84 Spe, with an Impish nature; it gives valuable chip damage against Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and also cripples physical attackers like Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus.</p>

<p>The Speed EVs give Giratina-O enough Speed to outpace 0 Speed Tentacruel before it can attempt to burn you with Scald. Attack is maximized to give Giratina-O's attacks some bite; for example, Dragon Tail OHKOes Palkia after Stealth Rock. The defensive EVs might seem strange, however, 172 HP EVs allow only three uses of Substitute, whilst 164 HP EVs lets Giratina-O use Substitute four times; the remaining EVs are split evenly between its two defensive stats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set benefits largely from entry hazards, as its main job is to stack residual damage and to hit hard with Dragon Tail. Therefore, pairing it with Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Deoxys-S is a good idea. Jirachi, Chansey, and Blissey also pair well with Giratina-O, as they have great defensive synergy and are able to pass Wishes onto it. Groudon doesn't take much damage from Giratina-O's attacks, but without Dragon Claw, it also fails to deal significant damage back, while Giratina-O will often outspeed Groudon's Roar and Dragon Tail it out. Substitute Lugia poses a significant threat, as Giratina-O can't hurt it and Lugia outspeeds Giratina-O even with no Speed investment, which means Whirlwind can phaze Giratina-O out before it can phaze Lugia with Dragon Tail. Without Stealth Rock support, Ho-Oh also proves a problem, as with Regenerator it can switch endlessly into this set provided Outrage isn't being used. If it doesn't get burned, Cloyster can break through Giratina-O's Substitute with Icicle Spear and do significant damage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike the standard SubCM set, this set focuses more on Speed and catching your opponent off-guard. While initially this set seems outclassed by Ghost Arceus, using it allows you to use another Arceus forme and it flies over both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, allowing it to switch in more freely due to the popularity of Spikes in Ubers.</p>

<p>Dragon Pulse is a powerful STAB move further boosted by Griseous Orb and has good neutral coverage in Ubers. Thanks to Giratina-O's Dragon typing, Dragon Pulse allows it to OHKO most of the Dragon-types in the tier after just Stealth Rock damage, including Palkia, Kyurem-W, Rayquaza, and Zekrom, something standard Calm Mind Ghost Arceus can not accomplish. Aura Sphere is generally an awesome coverage move, smashing Ferrothorn, Darkrai, Tyranitar, Heatran, Arceus, and Dialga to pieces. Keep in mind that all of them are 2HKOed at best if you are unboosted. If you are worried about more obscure threats such as Jirachi and Heatran blocking your sweep, Earth Power can be used. It also hits Blaziken and Electric Arceus for super effective damage but Blaziken normally crumbles to Dragon Pulse anyway.</p>

<p>Thunder hits Ho-Oh, Skarmory, and Kyogre, all of which would wall Giratina-O otherwise. If you decide to go with Thunder, Kyogre's rain support is very useful for maximum accuracy. Shadow Ball decimates Mewtwo and Ghost Arceus while dealing more damage than Thunder to Lugia, but is generally inferior to Dragon Pulse as the main STAB. The main use of Shadow Ball is to destroy otherwise solid checks such as Ghost Arceus, Lugia, Jirachi, and Bronzong. Thunder Wave can catch something like Darkrai switching in and cripples many checks such as Arceus. Will-O-Wisp is better on other sets; Substitute could be used to block status, but this set relies on sheer power and surprise value, which Substitute does not provide. Due to the lack of Substitute, Blissey and Chansey will easily wall this set, so powerful physical attackers, such as Terrakion are great partners. This Giratina-O is somewhat fragile, so use it with hazards to ensure it KOes the things it needs to before they can take it out; Ferrothorn is a good partner, having perfect synergy with Giratina-O and setting up hazards.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set is best used early- or mid-game for a "mini-sweep" to allow something like Arceus or Mewtwo to clean up the rest later. Thanks to its three attacking moves, Giratina-O can surprise quite a lot of normal checks such as Ghost Arceus coming in on Calm Mind and trying to set up alongside it, only to be 2HKOed by Shadow Ball. Modest is an option, but the main reason to use this set is for the higher Speed and coverage moves. Thanks to running a Timid nature, Giratina-O can now outrun slow Arceus, neutral nature Rayquaza, and Kyurem-W so it can KO them first. Tailwind, Hidden Power Fire, and Draco Meteor are also options but they are generally inferior to the moves listed. Tailwind gives you two turns to attempt a sweep but that is usually not possible because Giratina-O is not the most powerful sweeper around, although you can surprise would-be checks such as Palkia. Hidden Power Fire is sometimes useful for killing Forretress and Ferrothorn outside of rain, but Aura Sphere is usually the better option. Draco Meteor is Giratina-O's most powerful move available but it reduces Special Attack with every use, making a sweep even more unlikely. Using this set alongside Kyurem-W, Kyogre, Rayquaza, or other Pokemon that are good at breaking stall is advisable to use this set for maximum effect. Wish support is always nice but not really needed, and it can be hard to fit a user of the move onto Giratina-O's team anyway because only defensive Pokemon can viably use it and this set is better off on offensive teams.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Should Dragon Tail's negative priority and low Base Power not appeal to you on the mixed set, Dragon Claw or Outrage are viable options. If defensive Kyogre and Ho-Oh are problematic, Outrage is the superior option as it 3HKOes the former and 2HKOes the latter. It can also deal over 50% to all Arceus formes with 4 HP, barring Steel Arceus, and in conjunction with Toxic Spikes, Arceus will have a difficult time trying to stall it out. If none of those problems are of your concern, Dragon Claw is better as it lacks the locking drawback of Outrage, and thus can be thrown about much more easily. Keep in mind that in conjunction with entry hazards, Dragon Tail will do more damage on average than Dragon Claw and can potentially place the opponent in a bad position.</p>

<p>Stone Edge can be used to take down Ho-Oh but offers no real use outside of that. Giratina-O's signature move, Shadow Force, deals an incredible amount of damage, but its charge-up turn gives the opponent a free turn to possibly set up or put up a substitute, potentially leaving Giratina-O vulnerable to a powerful oncoming attack. Thunder Wave can cripple faster attackers such as Arceus and Choice Scarf Dialga. Destiny Bond is usable for surprise kills once in a while, but with Giratina-O's middling Speed, it is extremely unreliable and should not be used often. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back Spikes from Deoxys-S and Ferrothorn, as well as Dark Void from Darkrai, should you want to use Giratina-O as a lead. Giratina-O can also attempt to sweep from the physical side using Hone Claws, Shadow Sneak, Earthquake, and Dragon Claw, but its power in that department leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lugia can generally wall whatever Giratina-O throws at it and whittle it down with Ice Beam or blow it away with Whirlwind, while setting up Reflect to weaken its physical moves significantly. The rare Cresselia also follows the same principle, minus Whirlwind. Steel and Dark Arceus, with their great bulk and Speed, can switch into almost anything that Giratina-O throws at it and heal off the damage with Recover. It can proceed to severely damage Giratina-O with Judgment. Heatran can counter mixed versions without Earthquake and Calm Mind versions without Aura Sphere. Tyranitar and Jirachi are also annoying for the Mixed Attacker set without Earthquake. Dialga can take a hit from Giratina-O and OHKO back with its own STAB Dragon-type attacks. Keep in mind, though, that Dragon Tail makes countering Giratina-O harder than it seems.</p>

<p>Giratina-O isn't too difficult to revenge kill due to its weaknesses, lack of item options, and average Speed. Choice Scarf Palkia, Dialga, Reshiram, and Zekrom can easily OHKO Giratina-O with their STAB Dragon-type attacks. Darkrai outruns Giratina-O, resists Shadow Sneak, and can severely cripple it with Dark Pulse or put it to sleep with Dark Void. Be wary of the Calm Mind set, as it won't be so easily taken down. However, it doesn't have as much initial power as the Mixed Attacker set and requires setup.</p>
