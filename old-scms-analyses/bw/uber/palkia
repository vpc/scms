[Overview]

<p>Palkia is a dick. That isn't just a reference to its phallic appearance, Palkia is one of the most dangerous offensive threats in the metagame and often poses problems for nearly every team archetype. This comes from its ability to ejaculate a powerful STAB Surf or Hydro Pump, which can be reinforced by the presence of rain and supported by its signature Dragon-type STAB, Spacial Rend, as well as its many other coverage move options. It also has a key base 100 Speed that the many Ubers Pokemon sitting at base 90 or 95 Speed lust for. All these traits make it extremely difficult to block Palkia without resorting to the likes of Chansey or Grass Arceus. Palkia is also notable for its ability to stand erect in front of the mighty Kyogre's Choice Specs Water Spout, making it one of the few safe switch-ins to the king of Ubers. Palkia comes in all shapes and sizes ranging from its special attacking Lustrous Orb set to its Choice Specs and Choice Scarf variants. It also functions well under any weather condition, making it extremely easy to insert into a team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>All-out attacker Palkia is gifted with the right amount of power and coverage to be able to 2HKO nearly the entire metagame without having to resort to a Choice Specs set. This makes it extremely effective at tearing apart defensive cores as it requires little to no prediction. The freedom to change attacks allows it to maintain momentum and avoid becoming setup fodder. The versatility this set offers also helps to make it unpredictable, further complicating the process of checking it.</p>

<p>Spacial Rend is a reliable Dragon-type STAB and its ability to easily topple specially defensive Dragon-types like Giratina is what separates Palkia from other powerful Water-type special attackers. STAB Surf complements Spacial Rend excellently and is absurdly powerful under the rain, capable of 2HKOing bulky Arceus formes. Hydro Pump can be used in its place to secure more OHKOs than Surf; however, the inaccuracy is off-putting, and a rain-boosted Surf already 2HKOes everything you would use Hydro Pump for. Fire Blast is extremely important for 2HKOing Ferrothorn under rain and punishes Grass Arceus outside of rain. Thunder is a solid option for the last slot as it allows Palkia to fully fill its common role of checking Kyogre. However, Dragon Tail is very useful for preventing Calm Mind Arceus formes from setting up on Palkia and, with entry hazard support, is effective at wearing down Palkia's few checks, making it the superior choice for teams that aren't quite as concerned with Kyogre. Keep in mind that specially defensive Kyogre becomes quite a nuisance to Palkia if it does decide to pass on Thunder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lustrous Orb allows Palkia to OHKO Forretress with Surf after Stealth Rock as well as give a significant boost to Palkia's main STABs for general purposes. As Palkia's sole weakness is to Dragon-type attacks, Haban Berry allows Palkia to be an effective lure although at the price of power. Leftovers is another item choice that helps Palkia check Choice Scarf and defensive Kyogre more effectively; however, it misses out on the same power Haban Berry does. For those that dislike paralysis or burn from Kyogre's Thunder or Scald, Lum Berry is useful to keep Palkia in good condition. However, this is a one-time solution to a side effect of an already painful Thunder or a surely recurring burn from the long-lasting defensive Kyogre, making the loss in damage output all the more bothersome. Lastly, an Expert Belt can be used for those who would like to favor Palkia's super effective coverage options; however, its main STABs lose their consistent boost in power.</p>

<p>Palkia can use Aqua Tail with a Hasty nature over Thunder and Dragon Tail to 2HKO Chansey. Focus Punch can also be used with a Hasty nature over Fire Blast to hit Chansey while retaining Thunder or Dragon Tail and not losing automatically to Ferrothorn. Substitute can be used with or without Focus Punch to punish switches and protect Palkia from status; however, the loss in coverage generally increases the number of checks to Palkia. For teams that struggle against Ho-Oh in the sun, Stone Edge can be used to deal significant damage to it. Outrage can be used with Haban Berry to OHKO Latias; however, the result of getting locked into Outrage makes this option mediocre at best.</p>

<p>As dangerous and effective as Palkia is, it still appreciates team support to be at its best. Having a strong response to Chansey and Grass Arceus, especially for rain teams, is worthwhile. Fortunately, these two are quite easy to take advantage of, leaving you with multiple options. Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn are generally safe switch-ins to both Chansey and Grass Arceus and can set up Spikes or use Rapid Spin without much risk. Watch out for Calm Mind or Fire Blast Grass Arceus variants that might set up or KO your Spikes setter however. Tornadus-T and Ho-Oh are good offensive options to deal with Palkia's two main counters, but they need to be careful of switching into Toxic or Ice Beam in the case of Tornadus-T. Genesect and Kyurem-W are also good answers to Grass Arceus, although the former needs to watch out for Will-O-Wisp and Fire Blast. Also, keep in mind that Grass Arceus can be built to give Genesect a Special Attack boost, making it difficult to take down with U-turn when hazards are up. Powerful Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, can be used to force Chansey out, although they do not like switching into Toxic.</p>

<p>Even for Palkia that run Dragon Tail, Calm Mind Arceus formes are threatening enough that a check to them in some form is strongly suggested. Bulky Choice Specs and specially defensive Kyogre are fairly reliable checks to the majority of the Arceus formes that use Calm Mind. Besides direct checks, simply overloading the Arceus forme with offensive pressure from the likes of Mewtwo and Darkrai can wear it down enough to no longer threaten Palkia. Darkrai in particular is a helpful teammate as it is one of the few offensive checks to Calm Mind Ghost Arceus, the most common and dangerous Calm Mind user, and has Dark Void to serve as a blanket solution to the other Calm Mind Arceus.</p>

<p>Packing a Steel-type to switch into the Dragon-type attacks that Palkia attracts is helpful to avoid losing a Pokemon every time Palkia knocks something out. Latios and offensive Latias can be especially bothersome to handle if they manage to find themselves face-to-face with Palkia. Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Steel Arceus, and Heatran are generally reliable switch-ins to these two. Genesect is also a note-worthy check with its STAB U-turn, however, its fragility means even resisted Draco Meteors take a sizable chunk out of its health.</p>

<p>Spikes support is worthwhile for teams using Dragon Tail Palkia, as it allows Palkia to wear down its checks more quickly, reducing the need to predict switches as often. Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn are effective defensive Spikers that can also serve as Chansey or Grass Arceus checks as mentioned above. Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, and Froslass are some good examples of reliable suicide leads that can quickly set up layers of Spikes for offensive teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>What used to be one of the best sets in DPP has certainly fallen from grace. However, Choice Scarf Palkia still serves as a nice glue for teams that desperately need a Kyogre check and a revenge killer in one Pokemon. Choice Scarf Palkia still maintains most of the same advantages it always had. The base 100 Speed is a major advantage for a Choice Scarf user in order to keep Dragon Dance Rayquaza variants in line. It also has the advantage of outspeeding Choice Scarf Genesect, by far the most common Choice Scarf user, which adds significantly to Palkia's ability to clean teams. Palkia's Water typing and signature Spacial Rend are two unique advantages it has as a cleaner as well.</p>

<p>Surf is Palkia's most consistent and powerful move when you factor in rain support. Spacial Rend is almost just as important as it provides Palkia with an alternative move with consistently high power to clean up teams with, as well as hit the many bulky Dragon-types that resist Surf for super effective damage. Fire Blast allows Palkia to 2HKO Ferrothorn under the rain so that Palkia isn't utter Spikes fodder. Thunder rounds out the set by giving Palkia a means to hit Kyogre for super effective damage with a strong attack in order to fulfill its common role of Kyogre check.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Outrage can be used to OHKO Latias after Stealth Rock even when using a Timid nature. Just be sure to move the leftover 4 EVs from HP into Attack when using Outrage to have a guaranteed chance to OHKO All-out attacker Latias. Draco Meteor is another useful move for its ability to outright OHKO Pokemon like Darkrai. For those who really like power, Hydro Pump can be used over Surf, although the shaky accuracy will eventually come back to haunt you. Sleep Talk is a possible move choice in order to turn your Palkia into a sleep absorber for Darkrai, but Palkia is already very stretched for moveslots.</p>

<p>Rain support from Kyogre is very important to make Palkia as effective a cleaner as possible. Rain-boosted Surfs have the power to cleanly 2HKO max HP Arceus, which is often the core part of an offensive team's defensive backbone. It also makes Palkia a more effective revenge killer in general as it can drown threats such as Darkrai, Genesect, Tornadus-T, and often times even Mewtwo with a single Surf after Stealth Rock. That isn't to say that Choice Scarf Palkia should only be used on rain teams. Although it becomes far less effective, it still might find itself useful on a sand or sun team due to its ability to compress roles. If you happen to be considering Palkia for one of these teams, you can also consider using one of the alternative moves mentioned earlier, Draco Meteor and Outrage, in place of Surf. Keep in mind that, even on a sun team, Surf is beneficial for the possibility of cleaning up opposing rain teams.</p>

<p>Ferrothorn is often one of the biggest troubles to Choice Scarf Palkia, as it can easily switch in on most of its unboosted, Choice-locked attacks and proceed to set up layers of Spikes or pester the rest of your team with Leech Seed. Even Fire Blast comes no where near OHKOing under the rain, forcing the Palkia user to perfectly predict the Ferrothorn switch-in twice in order to remove it. This inherent Ferrothorn weakness puts more pressure on your team to not share the same difficulty. It's also important to have a teammate that can quickly force Ferrothorn out such as Ho-Oh or Fighting Arceus. Using a spinner is also not a wasted investment in the case that you find Ferrothorn setting up too many layers of Spikes on your field. Forretress is particularly effective at fighting off Ferrothorn as it can switch into any of its attacks, use Rapid Spin to remove any entry hazards and Leech Seed, and even set up Spikes itself thanks to Pain Split making it next to impossible for Ferrothorn to wear it down.</p>

<p>As with any other viable Palkia variant, Chansey, Blissey, and Grass Arceus are extremely difficult for Choice Scarf Palkia to beat. However, Grass Arceus is somewhat easier to eventually muscle through as Choice Scarf Palkia outspeeds it, allowing Palkia to land an extra Spacial Rend before Grass Arceus has a chance to use Recover. Being Choice-locked also opens up other potentially troublesome switch-ins such as Latias and Kyogre. Providing your team with some defensive backbone such as a Jirachi or Grass Arceus can help remove the risk you take when selecting one attack over another with Choice Scarf Palkia.</p>

<p>Although Choice Scarf Palkia is often used for its ability to revenge kill as well as check Kyogre, that doesn't mean it should be the only Kyogre check on your team. On the contrary, it's advised to add an additional Kyogre check as Choice Scarf Palkia is simply very inefficient at that role itself. Grass Arceus, Latias, and Latios are some good examples of additional Kyogre checks that you can use. You can also choose to severely limit the number of free turns your team gives to the assorted Kyogre sets instead of adding a secondary Kyogre check. This can help Palkia indirectly by decreasing the number of times you have to resort to it to check Kyogre.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although this set has intense competition from all-out attacker variants as a wallbreaker, there is certainly something to be said about possibly 2HKOing the likes of Ferrothorn with a resisted STAB. In general, Choice Specs Palkia OHKOes more and thus forces more switches than any other Palkia set. The strong STAB choices somewhat make up for the need to predict as a result of the inability to change moves. However, it does still run the risk of becoming setup fodder after its move choice has been revealed.</p>

<p>Hydro Pump is the most important move on this set, as the power it has under rain is absolutely absurd. It cleanly 2HKOes Protect Blissey with Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes and also had a solid chance to OHKO bulky Arceus formes without any hazards up at all. Spacial Rend becomes quite formidable with a Choice Specs as well, being capable of 2HKOing max HP Arceus formes, such as Grass Arceus, after Stealth Rock even if they Calm Mind after switching in. Draco Meteor is also impressive for those situations where you just want to nab a quick OHKO, such as against the likes of defensive Groudon, and then switch out afterwards. Fire Blast can be used instead of Draco Meteor to effortlessly wipe out Ferrothorn in the rain without having to put up with the fuss of Protect and insufficient hazards or prior damage. Thunder rounds out the set by giving Palkia a move to cleanly bust through specially defensive Kyogre with proper prediction.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You can attempt to jam Surf someplace to have another option for when you don't want to risk the miss with Hydro Pump.</p>

<p>Chansey and Grass Arceus with some Special Defense investment remain an issue for Palkia. Specially defensive Kyogre can also be bothersome if you don't properly predict with Thunder. Therefore, Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress are valuable teammates, especially as they can provide the Spikes support needed to secure multiple 2HKOs and OHKOs. Alternatively, simply having those Spikes early on, such as through a suicide lead like Deoxys-S or Deoxys-A, will allow Palkia to 2HKO these three nuisances as they attempt to switch in. You can also use something like Tornadus-T or Shaymin-S if you prefer to convert Chansey, Grass Arceus, and specially defensive Kyogre into free turns for something offensive. This is especially effective as these three will likely have to spend their following turn using some form of recovery after switching into Palkia.</p>

<p>Although the Chansey, Grass Arceus, and specially defensive Kyogre are generally the safest switch-ins, Pokemon such as Latias and Steel Arceus can absorb one of Palkia's STABs exceptionally well even if they do run the risk of an instant OHKO if Palkia opts for the other STAB. Because of this, it's good to have a teammate that can switch into these guys in case you predict poorly. Genesect and Steel Arceus are good options to handle a smart Latias user while a Ho-Oh or Dialga can keep most Steel Arceus in line.</p>

<p>Choice Specs Palkia demands rain more than any other Palkia variant simply because of how obscenely powerful its Hydro Pumps become with that support. However, it's worth noting that the significantly stronger Spacial Rend and Draco Meteor are valuable when the weather changes to sun, as they allow Palkia to 2HKO bulky Arceus formes and Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock. Therefore, it is difficult to say that rain support is a must as Choice Specs Palkia remains threatening outside of rain and, of course, becomes even more dangerous when facing a rain team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>For the more unfortunate, Dragon Pulse doesn't risk the miss that Spacial Rend does but it is significantly weaker and the chance of missing with Spacial Rend is very small. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple a Calm Mind Arceus attempting to set up on you or a Grass Arceus switch-in. Blizzard is a very inaccurate way to 2HKO Grass Arceus. Thunderbolt and Flamethrower might seem appealing due to their consistency, but their damage output is so underwhelming that you should never actually use them over Thunder and Fire Blast. Likewise, Ice Beam is an extremely ineffective move, more so when you consider that you can use the mediocre Blizzard to actually accomplish something in its place. Physical Palkia sets like Choice Band and physical mixed have the appeal of beating typical Palkia counters, most notably Chansey, but those counters are already very limited and a simple change in the final move on the all-out attacker set accomplishes the same thing. Furthermore, in exchange for bypassing Chansey, these physical sets add more checks and counters to the list, such as the dreaded Ferrothorn. Palkia doesn't have many options to boost its stats beyond Bulk Up and Absorb Bulb. Bulk Up suffers from the same problems as the other physical sets except that Palkia has even less coverage moves, which further increases its number of checks and counters. Absorb Bulb is an interesting way to increase Palkia's Special Attack when switching into Kyogre's Water Spout or Surf, but it suffers from being single use and from robbing you of a more consistent item like Lustrous Orb.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grass Arceus under rain, Chansey, and Blissey are the three biggest counters to Palkia. Thanks to its resistance to Water-type attacks and meaty natural bulk, only Spacial Rend from the Choice Specs set has a chance of beating Grass Arceus, but even that does not beat the support set if it fails to land a critical hit during the Recover stall before running out of its meager 8 PP or missing. A Calm Mind variant with a bit of Special Defense investment will easily beat even Choice Specs Palkia. The faster Speed also helps as it makes it harder for Palkia to use Dragon Tail in order to weaken Grass Arceus enough to not have the health to switch in. However, Grass Arceus will not be able to beat Palkia outside of the rain as Fire Blast will overwhelm it. Chansey and Blissey have such an absurd amount of special bulk that they can easily shrug off any of Palkia's special attacks regardless of the weather. Even a Choice Specs rain-boosted Hydro Pump will fail to 2HKO without Stealth Rock plus a layer of Spikes being up on the field. However, they do have to be wary of Palkia running Aqua Tail with Lustrous Orb, as their Defense, especially for Blissey, isn't nearly as gigantic as their Special Defense. Their lower Speed also leaves them vulnerable to Dragon Tail as they won't be able to use Softboiled before being hit by one of Palkia's attacks.</p>

<p>Changing the weather will allow more threats to counter Palkia. If the weather is sunny, just about any bulky Arceus forme will work well. Even Rock Arceus could beat Palkia as the sun would remove his Water-type weakness. Deoxys-D also works very well under the sun as long as Palkia isn't equipped with a Choice Specs. If Stealth Rock isn't up, Ho-Oh can take on Palkia very well thanks to the sun removing his Water-type weakness and crippling the accuracy of Thunder. When a sandstorm is raging, there are less options for bulky Arceus formes that counter Palkia as it maintains an unharmed Water-type STAB. Also, the extra residual damage from the sandstorm will put 252 HP Arceus in 2HKO range from a Lustrous Orb-boosted Spacial Rend. However, a minor amount of Special Defense investment remedies this issue. Deoxys-D, however, remains just as effective under a sandstorm as under sunny weather.</p>

<p>There remains a few more situational checks to Palkia. Gastrodon can survive two Spacial Rends from Lustrous Orb variants, but it does this with such little health remaining that it only takes a single Dragon Tail for Palkia to be able to play around it. Ludicolo is in the same boat, but at least it can hit Palkia with Leech Seed before being forced right back out by Dragon Tail. Latias can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Palkia and can even survive a Lustrous Orb-boosted Spacial Rend if healthy enough. Once in, she can easily OHKO Palkia with her Dragon-type STAB. Even Haban Berry Palkia risks being OHKOed after Stealth Rock by Draco Meteor if Latias runs enough Special Attack investment. Defensive Dialga can switch in once on the Lustrous Orb set but will lose outright to Haban Berry and Choice Specs variants. Specially defensive Kyogre can check Palkia if it lacks Thunder or fails to predict properly in the case of Choice Specs Palkia. Ferrothorn under rain is a pest to Choice Scarf Palkia and can beat Lustrous Orb variants if it manages to avoid switching into Fire Blast.</p>

<p>To scratch the bottom of the barrel, you can use faster Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Latios if you manage to bring them in with excellent prediction or after Palkia knocks something out. Haban Berry Palkia excels at luring these types of response out and punishing them, so be careful or use very powerful Dragon-type attacks like Latios's Draco Meteor. If Palkia lacks Dragon Tail or fails to paralyze with Thunder, Calm Mind Arceus formes can set up on it once safely in. Wobbuffet, and to a lesser extent, Tyranitar, can trap Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Palkia locked into a weaker coverage move. Using a Dragon-type with Haban Berry is another way to beat Palkia one-on-one.</p>

<p>In general, the best way to handle Palkia is to just deny it as many free turns as possible. By filling your team with faster threats or bulky ones that can beat it one-on-one as well as checks like Dialga and Latias, you can minimize the amount of damage Palkia does to your team.</p>
