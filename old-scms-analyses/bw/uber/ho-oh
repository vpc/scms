[Overview]

<p>With a huge base 130 Attack and powerful STAB options in Sacred Fire (which carries an impressive 50% burn rate) and Brave Bird, Ho-Oh can easily put serious hurt on anything that dares to stand up to it. Regenerator increases Ho-Oh's durability, allowing Ho-Oh to function as a bulky pivot. Ho-Oh can even amp up its middling Speed with Flame Charge, potentially sweeping an entire weakened team with its immensely powerful STABs. Ho-Oh is one of the most dangerous sun based Pokemon in the game; even in rain, Ho-Oh still has a powerful Brave Bird to throw around, a move not even Kyogre will enjoy taking. Ho-Oh is not restricted to a specific weather archetype because it counters certain threats such as Fighting Arceus, Ghost Arceus, and sun teams, which often find themselves completely walled by Ho-Oh. 154 base Special Defense with 106 base HP gives Ho-Oh great special bulk and, when combined with Ho-Oh's good offenses and Sacred Fire's great burn chance, makes it an amazing offensive tank that has equal special bulk to Great Wall Lugia! Even with a crippling weakness to the common Stealth Rock, Ho-Oh's amazing qualities allow it to thrive in the hostile Uber metagame due to its combination of power and bulk. Unfortunately, Stealth Rock will continue to be Ho-Oh's biggest weakness even with access to Regenerator, as the rainbow bird despises losing 50% of its HP on every switch.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Ho-Oh set shrugs off most non-super effective hits while replying with powerful attacks of its own. Unlike most walls, Ho-Oh packs a lot of power, so it can KO the opponent outright instead of relying on status or phazing moves. Thanks to Ho-Oh's great stat layout, it can wall most special attackers with just 248 HP EVs; most Calm Mind Arceus that lack a super effective attack to hit Ho-Oh with have little hope of breaking past it. This set also checks many other notable threats, such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, Palkia, Reshiram, Latias, Genesect, Dialga, and Tornadus-T.</p>

<p>Sacred Fire and Brave Bird are the main attacks. Sacred Fire's solid burn rate deters switch-ins from the likes of Rayquaza and other powerful physical attackers hoping to take out Ho-Oh. Brave Bird is a powerful STAB move that can be easily thrown around in a tier where few common Pokemon resist Flying-type attacks, easily annihilating Kyogre, Palkia, and Reshiram. Roost lets Ho-Oh stall out defensive Groudon's Stone Edge, which becomes even easier when Groudon is burned with Sacred Fire. Although Roost makes Ho-Oh vulnerable to Earthquake, most users of the move are faster than Ho-Oh anyway, and Stone Edge from Groudon will still do more damage to a non-Roosting Ho-Oh than Earthquake to a Roosting one. Substitute gives Ho-Oh status protection and eases prediction; it can be set up easily because Ho-Oh frequently finds free turns due to the many Pokemon that can't touch it, such as Ferrothorn and Blissey.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Special Defense EVs just guarantee Ho-Oh's survival against some powerful attacks. +4 Timid Life Orb Darkrai cannot OHKO this Ho-Oh, Choice Scarf Palkia only has a 3.13% chance to 2HKO with Thunder, and 252+ Dialga's Draco Meteor does a maximum of 51.56%. Any max Special Attack neutral-natured Arceus will never 2HKO Ho-Oh with a +1 neutral Judgment thanks to Leftovers. A Life Orb can be used over Leftovers, trading longevity for power; the item secures important OHKOs and 2HKOs that Ho-Oh cannot achieve with Leftovers, such as the almost-guaranteed OHKO on Choice Scarf Kyogre with Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage. Genesect can never get past Ho-Oh unless it manages to grab a Special Attack boost beforehand and has Thunder or Explosion. Even Kyurem-W has trouble killing a full health Ho-Oh, as only Modest Choice Specs Ice Beam stands a chance to 2HKO and Draco Meteor can be outstalled with Roost. Both Latias and Latios are walled by Ho-Oh unless the latter packs Psyshock or rain is up and they carry Surf. Thunder from Latias barely 2HKOes Ho-Oh, while Brave Bird can easily net a 2HKO or even an OHKO if you are using Life Orb. When using a Life Orb, an alternate spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe can be used for maximum power and optimum bulk. Leftovers is the preferred item, as Ho-Oh enjoys the extra recovery and the prevention of Brave Bird recoil from wearing down Ho-Oh too quickly.</p>

<p>Earthquake is an option, as it rounds out Ho-Oh's coverage superbly, 2HKOing all forms of Zekrom (even OHKOing offensive variants after damage from Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes) as well as deterring Rock Arceus and the rare Heatran from switching in freely. Whirlwind allows Ho-Oh to become a great phazer, but that is generally better left to physically defensive Ho-Oh, which has more bulk.</p>

<p> If you need Ho-Oh to beat Choice Specs Kyurem-W, using a set with max Special Defense investment is possible, but Ho-Oh will have to sacrifice a lot of power. Sunny Day can also be used on this set (in the last slot) to lure in Kyogre, Ho-Oh's most common check, and turn the tables on it, but this can only be done on the predicted switch-in or on defensive Kyogre, which usually do not invest in Speed. Ho-Oh's favorite teammates are Groudon and a Rapid Spinner; the former pumps up the power of Sacred Fire, while the latter serves as a means to prevent&mdash;but not guarantee&mdash;Stealth Rock from being up to cripple Ho-Oh. This set also really appreciates paralysis support to make up for its low Speed. Grass Arceus deters Ground-types from switching in with its typing, allowing it to slow down a large chunk of the enemy team with Thunder Wave. Dialga, Groudon, Lugia, Kyogre, Jirachi, and Blissey can also spread paralysis very effectively, as they are not common Thunder Wave users. Entry hazards are also recommended because Ho-Oh can force a lot of switches. Forretress can set up all three entry hazards, and Ho-Oh can easily come in on Fire-type attacks aimed at Forretress and start firing off powerful attacks. Excadrill is the best spinner in the tier, but it should only be paired with Ho-Oh on a sand team, as stacking Groudon and Excadrill with Ho-Oh makes the team extremely weak to Kyogre. Excadrill can easily switch in on Rock- or Electric-type attacks for Ho-Oh and weaken threats, while Ho-Oh can find many switch-in opportunities on Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks aimed at Excadrill. While unreliable, Espeon and Xatu can use their Magic Bounce ability to keep Stealth Rock off the field for some time to support Ho-Oh.</p>

<p>Forretress and Tentacruel are the only viable partners for Ho-Oh that can set up Toxic Spikes. Toxic Spikes, when combined with Substitute and Roost, can allow Ho-Oh to outstall many threats simply by spamming Substitute and Roost. For example, Ho-Oh can come in on something that it walls but is faster, such as Choice Scarf Palkia, and set up a Substitute as Palkia is worn down by the Toxic poison. From there, Ho-Oh can net another KO or two while safely behind its Substitute. However, bear in mind that you can no longer burn threats when they are poisoned.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ho-Oh's greatest weakness has historically been Stealth Rock, which has dissuaded the use of Choice items on it. However, with Regenerator, Ho-Oh is able to switch in and out more freely, allowing it to wield the fearsome power of a Choice Band with far less risk. With a Choice Band, Ho-Oh becomes incredibly difficult to switch into; while a Life Orb also grants a comparable level of power, Choice Band's lack of recoil is appealing&mdash;even with Regenerator, Ho-Oh does not want to deal with additional passive damage when Stealth Rock is up. Choice Band-boosted Sacred Fire has amazing power in the sun, doing things such as OHKOing Arceus and Dialga after Stealth Rock and providing a comfortable 2HKO on physically defensive Groudon. It also ensures that Ho-Oh can take lead Deoxys-S down to its Focus Sash and&mdash;due to the chance of burn&mdash;limit Deoxys-S to one layer of hazards 47.5% of the time. Brave Bird is also incredibly powerful, OHKOing Kyogre and Palkia with no prior damage. It also 2HKOes Giratina-O, Forretress, and most physically defensive Arceus formes as well as a 2HKO on physically defensive Giratina with Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Earthquake covers Tyranitar, Rock Arceus, Kabutops, Omastar, Heatran, and Dialga in rain. Sleep Talk allows Ho-Oh to be a relatively safe switch-in to Darkrai's dreaded Dark Void, while Punishment can be used to smash Calm Mind users weak to it, such as Ghost Arceus, Giratina-O, and Latias.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Heavy HP investment gives Ho-Oh more bulk and makes the use of Brave Bird much less risky. Alternatively, maximum Speed can be used to get the drop on as many other base 90 Pokemon as possible, but the loss in bulk is noticeable. Ho-Oh's movepool is quite sparse, so what's listed here is about as good as it gets. Very niche options for the fourth slot include Aerial Ace to guarantee a connection against an Evasion booster and Roost to help deal with residual damage if a free turn is presented&mdash;this is of course very risky on a Choice-locked Pokemon.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is actually more important for this set than sunlight. Unlike other sets, which have access to recovery, this Ho-Oh will be switching out often and relying on Regenerator to keep itself alive. Forretress can Rapid Spin while also providing entry hazards and switch-in opportunities with Volt Switch. Excadrill can switch into Zekrom fairly safely and can provide Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support as well. Groudon is also an important supporter for this set&mdash;while the raw power of Brave Bird allows this set to function even in rain, Ho-Oh greatly appreciates boosted Sacred Fires and a neutrality to Water-type moves. Groudon can provide Stealth Rock as well, which makes Multiscale Lugia easier to handle and ensures a few important OHKOes and 2HKOes. Offensively, Extreme Killer Arceus is an excellent complement to this set, as is Rock Polish Groudon. Both greatly enjoy this set's ability to cripple opposing Giratina and Groudon, and Sacred Fire's burn rate can grant easy set-up opportunities for them. Ho-Oh is also an excellent switch-in to Choice Scarf Genesect, something which can interfere with a weakened Extreme Killer Arceus's sweep. Defensively, partners that can switch into Kyogre are very important; Latias and Palkia are good examples.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Sweeper
move 1: Flame Charge / Tailwind
move 2: Sacred Fire
move 3: Brave Bird
move 4: Roost / Earthquake
item: Life Orb
ability: Regenerator
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of Ho-Oh's biggest problems is usually its middling base 90 Speed, but this can be mitigated by using Flame Charge or Tailwind to boost its Speed to more acceptable levels. Sun support from Groudon is highly recommended to power up Ho-Oh's STAB Sacred Fire and Flame Charge and to remove Ho-Oh's weakness to Water-type attacks. Sun also reduces Thunder's accuracy to an unreliable 50%, which can be helpful because some threats rely on Thunder to take out Ho-Oh.</p>

<p>Flame Charge and Tailwind both have their own advantages. Flame Charge's Speed boost lasts until Ho-Oh switches out and allows Ho-Oh to soften up the foe with a light smack before going on the full offensive. It can also break Focus Sashes and Sturdy so that one of Ho-Oh's other attacks can KO on the next turn. Flame Charge is the more consistent option, as the boost stays until Ho-Oh switches out, and Ho-Oh can continue boosting its Speed till +6 with enough free turns. However, Tailwind offers a significantly higher initial Speed boost. For example, Ho-Oh requires a Jolly Nature and 252 Speed EVs just to Speed tie with positive natured base 90 Speed Pokemon that have a Choice Scarf. However, Ho-Oh can outrun max Speed base 108 Pokemon equipped with Choice Scarf while itself running a neutral nature and only 176 Speed EVs after a single use of Tailwind. Tailwind also benefits the entire team; if Ho-Oh needs to switch out, a counter to your opponent's Ho-Oh check can step in and perform a mini-sweep of its own using the boosted Speed granted by Tailwind. However, Tailwind only lasts three turns after being used, which means Ho-Oh cannot sweep for long when more than three faster threats are still around.</p>

<p>Sacred Fire is always the main attack Ho-Oh will be using, and when backed by STAB and sunlight, outright OHKOes many Pokemon in the Uber tier, such as Mewtwo, as well as at least 2HKOing anything that does not resist it. Brave Bird, Ho-Oh's other incredibly potent STAB move of choice, nails Kyogre, Reshiram, and Palkia for assured OHKOs after just Stealth Rock damage. Brave Bird also provides Ho-Oh with a very strong sweeping attack in case the weather is not in its favor, but the recoil can be huge depending on how much damage it does. Roost rounds out the set brilliantly, helping Ho-Oh recover damage incurred from Stealth Rock and Life Orb, as well possibly allowing it to gain multiple Flame Charge boosts or to set up Tailwind repeatedly. While this Ho-Oh is an excellent offensive Pokemon, the loss of bulk is pretty significant, so it can no longer wall more powerful threats such as Calm Mind Arceus and Reshiram as reliably because both +1 Judgment and Draco Meteor OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. Weaker threats, such as Shaymin-S and Darkrai, can still be checked, though. Although Fire- and Flying-type STABs are a good combination, they leave Ho-Oh walled by Zekrom, Heatran (it needs Toxic or Hidden Power Rock to beat Ho-Oh one on one, however), and Rock-type Pokemon. Earthquake solves this problem by OHKOing Zekrom after it takes damage from Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, always OHKOing Heatran, and 2HKOing at worst all common Rock-type Pokemon. However, without Roost, Ho-Oh is extremely vulnerable to Stealth Rock, so solid Rapid Spin support is necessary with Earthquake.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are fairly simple. Maximum Attack is used to hit as hard as possible, and the Speed EVs enable Ho-Oh to hit 418 Speed after a Flame Charge, which lets it outpace everything below Choice Scarf Heatran. If using Tailwind, it is best to run 176 Speed EVs, which allow Ho-Oh to outspeed Choice Scarf Terrakion with Tailwind up. An Adamant nature is preferred because it affords Ho-Oh a large amount of much-needed power. However, Jolly allows Ho-Oh to outspeed Deoxys-A and tie with Choice Scarf-wielding base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Timid Reshiram, after a Flame Charge boost and Jolly Max Speed Excadrill in the sand after a Tailwind. If you want to take advantage of Ho-Oh's bulk, a spread of 140 HP / 176 Atk / 192 Spe can be used with an Adamant nature to outrun everything up to Mewtwo after a Flame Charge boost, but this comes at the price of losing some power and Speed. Flame Plate is possible over Life Orb to power up Sacred Fire and Flame Charge if you hate the recoil. Sky Plate can be used to 2HKO bulky Kyogre and Giratina-O with Brave Bird. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe lets you act like tank Ho-Oh with the ability to support the team through Tailwind, still giving Ho-Oh enough Speed to outspeed everything up to Mewtwo.</p>

<p>Groudon, with its great bulk and everlasting sunlight courtesy of Drought, fulfills Ho-Oh's sunlight needs perfectly. Groudon can also set up Stealth Rock to help Ho-Oh nab some important OHKOs and is capable of beating many Pokemon that check Ho-Oh, such as Terrakion and Zekrom. Forretress's good Defense and many resistances allow it to fulfill the Rapid Spinning role perfectly; it can even set up Spikes to facilitate Ho-Oh's sweep. While attempting a successful Rapid Spin is hard in Ubers, Forretress does way more than that, as it can also help tank Outrages aimed at Ho-Oh and check certain threats, such as Terrakion with Gyro Ball. If you just wish to delay the setting up of Stealth Rock on your side of the field, Deoxys-S with Taunt is a good choice, as it can achieve this fairly easily thanks to its high Speed and can set up its own Stealth Rock. Magic Bounce users can also delay the opponent from setting up Stealth Rock. Sadly, the two Pokemon with the ability are easy to KO, making them mediocre partners.</p>

<p>The best counter to this set is Rock Arceus, as it packs resistances to both of Ho-Oh's STAB moves, is bulky enough to take an Earthquake, and can easily destroy Ho-Oh with one Judgment. Ho-Oh also isn't a fan of Kyogre and Zekrom, as the former disposes of Ho-Oh's beloved sunlight and the latter can handle one hit from Ho-Oh and OHKO it with Bolt Strike. Defensive Groudon can also be an annoyance to this set, as Sacred Fire only 2HKOes it while Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh if you fail to burn Groudon. Rock-types are rare in Ubers, and the only semi-common ones are Tyranitar and Terrakion, which are easily checked by Groudon. Thankfully, Groudon's bulk and very powerful STAB Earthquake make it an excellent counter to Zekrom, opposing Groudon, and Rock-types, including Rock Arceus. Palkia can easily come in on Kyogre's powerful Water-type strikes and defeat it with Thunder. Grass Arceus is capable of checking pretty much all of Ho-Oh's counters, either crippling them with status or setting up on them with Calm Mind. Latias can also help defeat Kyogre and Terrakion with her powerful Grass Knot.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Tailwind and Flame Charge can boost Ho-Oh's Speed, those require a turn of setup. With a Choice Scarf, Ho-Oh becomes a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner with its powerful attacks and solid bulk. Although Ho-Oh does not outrun most opposing Choice Scarf users, it is still fast enough to outrun all Pokemon up to Mewtwo and positive-natured Deoxys-A if you choose to go with a Jolly nature.</p>

<p>Sacred Fire, even without a Life Orb boost, is still a ridiculously powerful attack in the sunlight that maims anything that does not resist it. Brave Bird also stands as a very powerful secondary STAB that 2HKOes almost all Kyogre and Palkia. Only Bold Kyogre has a chance of avoiding the 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage and Scald does not even OHKO Ho-Oh in return. Earthquake is there to cover Pokemon such as Zekrom, Terrakion, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Reshiram, as well as getting a harder hit on Dialga outside of sun. However, getting locked into Earthquake is risky due to the sheer number of Flying-types and Levitate Pokemon in the Uber environment, so exercise caution before going ahead with the attack. Punishment is chosen as the last move to KO set-up sweepers such as Calm Mind Mewtwo, Giratina-O, and Ghost Arceus. As Punishment increases in power as these Pokemon gain Calm Mind boosts, Ho-Oh can easily use Punishment to save your team from utter ruin if the enemy Calm Mind user has acquired multiple boosts. Sleep Talk lets Ho-Oh switch in on Darkrai; Brave Bird and Sacred Fire can KO it after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs let Ho-Oh outrun everything up to neutral-natured Deoxys-A and maximize power, as this set needs all the power it can get. With an Adamant nature, Sacred Fire in the sun is even more powerful than Zekrom's Bolt Strike. If you manage to keep Stealth Rock off the field, Regenerator allows Ho-Oh to last a lot longer than most Choice Scarf users.</p>

<p>Any teammate from the previous sets will also work well with this one. However, due to this Ho-Oh's considerably lower power, it can be more easily walled, as even defensive Groudon is not 2HKOed by any of Ho-Oh's moves. Wobbuffet can trap Ho-Oh with Shadow Tag and Counter it to oblivion as long as it does not come in on Sacred Fire in the sun. Choice Band Zekrom is able to stomp all over Kyogre with its powerful STAB Bolt Strike and can weaken Wobbuffet to the point where it can no longer trap Ho-Oh and live. Mixed attackers, such as Palkia and Dialga, can bluff a Choice Scarf by holding an item such as Lustrous Orb or Expert Belt to lure Wobbuffet in. As it Counters or Mirror Coats expecting a physical or special attack, Wobbuffet will quickly find itself being wiped off the face of the planet from an attack on the opposite side. However, Custap Berry allows Wobbuffet to somewhat bypass this with a faster Destiny Bond, although it has to be in the right HP range to work. Toxic Spikes from Forretress also badly mess up Wobbuffet. Using the sheer power that Pokemon such as Choice Specs Kyurem-W and Rayquaza possess can also help to eliminate Wobbuffet.</p>

<p>This Ho-Oh set has no form of recovery outside of Regenerator, so Rapid Spin support from Forretress is a must. Using Wish support is also a good idea, as it gives Ho-Oh more switch-in opportunities, especially when Stealth Rock is up. Blissey is a notable Wish user, as it can pass Wishes so enormous that they will often fully heal Ho-Oh. Jirachi can also use Wish effectively and has access to U-turn, great bulk, and numerous resistances, including one to Rock-type attacks. If you are using Ho-Oh on a sand team, Excadrill can be a great partner thanks to its solid power deterring Ghost-types from switching in and access to Rapid Spin. However, using Ho-Oh on a sun team is best to power up Sacred Fire, and Groudon itself makes a great partner to Ho-Oh.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ho-Oh's Defense might not seem like much, but when fully invested and with the assistance of Sacred Fire burns, the rainbow phoenix can take its fair share of physical abuse. This Ho-Oh aims to spread burns through Sacred Fire and act as an excellent pivot through Regenerator. Full investment in Defense allows Ho-Oh to take a myriad of physical attacks much more comfortably; Extreme Killer Arceus's +2 ExtremeSpeed, Rayquaza's +1 Outrage, Mewtwo's +1 Psystrike, and support Groudon's Stone Edge all fail to OHKO.</p>

<p>Sacred Fire is needed to spread burns; Brave Bird is the other obligatory STAB attack, dealing respectable damage, even with minimal Attack investment. Substitute is the primary option to ease prediction and protect Ho-Oh from status. Earthquake can also be used to hit Heatran and the Rock-types that plague Ho-Oh. Whirlwind is another option to rack up hazard damage and scout switches; it is especially effective because Ho-Oh forces out a lot of Pokemon. Roost gives Ho-Oh some much needed longevity outside of switching out repeatedly. Roost can be used with a faster spread to absorb Ice-, Rock-, and Electric-type attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is simple, as it maximizing Defense and maintains an odd HP number to round down Stealth Rock damage. The leftover EVs are placed in Attack to give a little kick to Sacred Fire and Brave Bird. Combined with Regenerator, this Ho-Oh can switch endlessly into both Giratina formes, only taking significant damage from invested Giratina-O's Outrage. Ho-Oh still has massive Special Defense, meaning it can perform its normal duties of switching into the powerful special attacks thrown about in Ubers.</p>

<p>Like all other Ho-Oh sets, the removal of Stealth Rock is greatly appreciated; Forretress, Tentacruel, and Excadrill are all excellent spinners in Ubers. Groudon isn't nearly as necessary for this set as other Ho-Oh sets, as Sacred Fire's primary job is to spread burns. A physically defensive Ghost-type Pokemon, such as RestTalk Giratina-O, pairs excellently with this Ho-Oh, absorbing the weak attacks of burned Pokemon and phazing with Dragon Tail. Ferrothorn is also a great partner to this set, as it handles the majority of the Pokemon commonly found on rain teams and walls Choice Scarf Zekrom. Latias, Palkia, Chansey, and Blissey also make for great defensive partners, absorbing the few strong special attacks that Ho-Oh can't.</p>

<p>This set still fears rain-boosted Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Kyogre and Palkia, in addition to Thunder, although the latter does not usually KO. Stone Edge from any offensively-inclined Pokemon will still KO Ho-Oh, although defensive Groudon has a chance not to. Jolly Choice Scarf Zekrom's Bolt Strike has a chance not to KO, but the KO with Adamant is still guaranteed.<p>

<p>Thunder Wave can be used over one of the attacking options, as it is very annoying for opposing Ho-Oh and can cripple other threats that rely on their Speed, such as over-eager Choice Scarf Kyogre looking to switch in on Sacred Fire. Toxic is also viable, crippling Lugia and Arceus Rock, two of Ho-Oh's greatest checks, but they don't exactly appreciate Thunder Wave either.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Recover is an option over Roost if you desperately need to keep Ho-Oh's immunity to Ground-type attacks at all times. Hippowdon is the only notable Earthquake user that is always slower than Ho-Oh, but it can easily be burned and walled anyway. Ho-Oh can utilize any of Reflect, Light Screen, and Toxic to become a very good wall with Pressure, but that role is better left to Lugia, which has greater Defense and Speed. Ho-Oh is also a good spreader of paralysis with Thunder Wave, so the move can be used on defensive sets, but Ho-Oh is better off killing things directly. Ground-type Pokemon, such as Groudon and Garchomp, rarely switch into Ho-Oh due to the risk of getting burned by Sacred Fire. Safeguard can also be used to give Ho-Oh status protection, but Substitute is usually the better option, as it also stops Leech Seed. Finally, Ho-Oh can use Calm Mind or Choice Specs and run a decent special attacking set with its good base 110 Special Attack, but it's generally outclassed by Reshiram in that respect due to Reshiram's much higher Special Attack and access to STAB Dragon-type attacks. Thunder seems like a great move to KO Kyogre, but Brave Bird actually does more damage to most Kyogre due to Kyogre's Defense being much lower than its Special Defense and Ho-Oh's high Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ho-Oh is extremely hard to counter due to its high bulk, powerful attacks, and the threat of a burn. The best way to keep Ho-Oh in check isn't a Pokemon at all; it is Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock limits Ho-Oh's longevity by stripping off 50% of its health every time it switches in. Even with Regenerator, Ho-Oh fears Stealth Rock more than anything else. Keeping a sturdy Ghost-type such as Giratina-O or Ghost Arceus is recommended to ensure Stealth Rock isn't spun away.</p>

<p>Kyogre is by far the most common way to check Ho-Oh because of Drizzle canceling out Ho-Oh's beloved sunlight and Kyogre's immense power. A full power Water Spout from Kyogre can easily drown Ho-Oh regardless of its EVs. While surprising, specially defensive Ho-Oh actually stands a chance of surviving one Surf from non-Choice Specs Kyogre. Additionally, offensive Kyogre is 2HKOed by Brave Bird. Bold Kyogre avoids the 2HKO from Brave Bird, but Scald does not OHKO in return, making it a shaky check. The reason Kyogre is so widely used to counter Ho-Oh is because it can counteract Ho-Oh's most common partner, Groudon. Most of Ho-Oh's checks are defeated by Groudon, but Kyogre easily OHKOes both with its high-powered Water-type attacks, making it the most consistent check.</p>

<p>Rock Arceus is probably the closest thing Ho-Oh has to a true counter. It resists both Sacred Fire and Brave Bird, has the bulk to take multiple hits, and can OHKO Ho-Oh with a swift Judgment. However, Rock Arceus really hates switching in on Earthquake repeatedly, as it 2HKOes, especially in conjunction with burn damage. Zekrom also resists both of Ho-Oh's STABs, has high Defense, and can easily fell it with Bolt Strike. However, Zekrom loathes a possible burn, and a Life Orb Earthquake almost OHKOes it. Heatran is immune to Sacred Fire and a burn and resists Brave Bird but is OHKOed by Earthquake and cannot do much to Ho-Oh in return besides Toxic. Palkia quadruple resists Sacred Fire and can take one Brave Bird from full health, but even though it possesses STAB Water-type attacks, Ho-Oh actually walls Palkia in the sunlight unless it carries Stone Edge. Outside of sun, Palkia can easily 2HKO Ho-Oh with Surf, and Stone Edge is a must if you rely on Palkia to check Ho-Oh. Power Gem does not even come close to OHKOing Ho-Oh. Giratina is one of the few walls capable of soaking up Ho-Oh's attacks somewhat comfortably, but it cannot do much in return besides phaze, as Ho-Oh can avoid Toxic with Substitute. Physically defensive Giratina-O is not 2HKOed by Brave Bird and can 2HKO Ho-Oh back with Outrage, but an untimely burn messes it up. Rayquaza also outspeeds Ho-Oh and can Outrage it into oblivion, but Rayquaza can only really come in on Earthquake, as it cannot risk eating a burn or Brave Bird. Lugia can cripple Ho-Oh with a faster Toxic, can soften hits with Reflect, and stall Ho-Oh out with Roost and Pressure. However, Lugia does not enjoy taking repeated Sacred Fires in the sun, especially because Lugia is likely to be burned as well. Lugia is also capable of forcing out Ho-Oh with Whirlwind but cannot deal real damage outside of Toxic. A fast Choice Band Groudon can survive at least one attack and OHKO Ho-Oh with Stone Edge, even after a burn. Tyranitar resists both of Ho-Oh's STABs and has a powerful Stone Edge to OHKO back, but it risks getting stalled out by Substitute if Stone Edge misses and is extremely vulnerable to being burned. Kyurem-B does not resist any of Ho-Oh's common attacks but is faster than it and bulky enough to take one hit and OHKO back with Fusion Bolt. Hippowdon can take repeated hits thanks to Slack Off, set up Stealth Rock, and Whirlwind Ho-Oh out, but it fails to do any real damage.</p>

<p>Mewtwo can OHKO Ho-Oh with Psystrike after Stealth Rock damage, but it cannot switch in safely on any move besides Roost. While it is a rather strange proposition, a defensive Fire Arceus with Stone Edge is immune to burn and can KO Ho-Oh in one hit, making it one of the best albeit niche counters to Ho-Oh. Kabutops quadruple resists Sacred Fire and is only 3HKOed by Brave Bird, so it can switch in on one hit and OHKO slower Ho-Oh sets with Stone Edge, but Earthquake can smash it to pieces, so it must be wary of switching in. Reshiram with Stone Edge can turn the tables on Ho-Oh, as it does not fear burn or Sacred Fire while Stone Edge OHKOes. Almost anything faster than Ho-Oh that has a Rock-type attack, such as Choice Scarf Garchomp or Terrakion, can easily revenge kill it with Stone Edge.</p>
