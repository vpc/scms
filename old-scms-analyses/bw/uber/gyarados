[Overview]

<p>Gyarados has had a long and miserable history in the Uber tier, dating way back to DPP. Most people treated it as some sort of joke, and never took it seriously. Not all hope was lost, however, as they were eventually swayed to approve its usefulness. While not awesome, it has a niche in the tier with a support set designed to work under any weather condition, rain and sand in particular. Its somewhat unique typing grants it a Ground and Spikes immunity, as well as resistances to some common attacks such as Fire Blast and Surf. Intimidate is a huge boon to Gyarados's niche in Ubers, as it boosts Gyarados's measly physical Defense stat to levels comparable to that of Lugia's, allowing Gyarados to check numerous physical attackers and act as a wonderful pivot. Unlike most of the weaker walls, such as Giratina and Lugia, Gyarados can do decent damage to things it should be checking, such as Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Ho-Oh. Its base 81 Speed might not seem like much, but it is just enough for Gyarados to outpace most stall-based Pokemon, such as Forretress and Chansey. Access to unique moves such as Taunt, Dragon Tail, Toxic, and Thunder Wave makes it a decent stallbreaker like Heatran; however, Gyarados brings a different list of resistances to the table and checks different threats. Although ever-lasting rain makes Gyarados vulnerable to Thunder, rain boosts the power of Gyarados's STAB attack, while sand teams will appreciate Gyarados' combination of unique typing and Intimidate support to check dangerous sweepers, such as Excadrill and Rock Polish Groudon. Gyarados does have its obvious flaws, however, such as its lack of reliable recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock, which means it cannot take repeated beatings without Wish support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes all of Gyarados's unique attributes as a defensive threat capable of breaking stall and checking dangerous sweepers at the same time. Taunt is its advantage over similar Pokemon such as Giratina and Lugia, as it gives Gyarados the ability to stop the enemy from recovering HP, prevents status moves from being thrown around, and also stops entry hazard users from setting up as long as they are slower than Gyarados. All of the defensive Spikes users besides fast Deoxys-D sets are easily stopped in their tracks by Taunt. Although Ferrothorn can wear down Gyarados through repeated Power Whips, it cannot recover with Leech Seed or set up Spikes. Volt Switch Forretress can be a nuisance as well, and Gyarados also needs to be paired with a Ghost-type, as entry hazards play a huge role in its success. Taunt is also a great move to stop RestTalk users such as Kyogre and Giratina. Thanks to the new sleep mechanics, Gyarados can easily Taunt them on the first turn and phaze them out the following turn, preventing them from doing anything. Thankfully, Gyarados resists Water-type attacks, so mono-attacking Kyogre will not be able to do much damage, although an unlucky burn on the switch will greatly shorten Gyarados's life. Gyarados has good enough defenses to stave off unboosted Dragon Pulses from Giratina and force it out with Dragon Tail. If it tries to recover with Rest, Taunt will just make it useless.</p>

<p>Double switching is important to make proper use of Intimidate, and with the ability in effect, Gyarados can easily live hits from powerful sweepers, such as Rayquaza's Outrage and Ho-Oh's Brave Bird. This unique ability also makes Gyarados a decent team player, and while it cannot support its team in any other way, it is capable of utilizing entry hazards on its own through Dragon Tail&mdash;another key move of this set. Gyarados has a usable base 125 Attack to go along with Dragon Tail, and while it lacks STAB, it is powerful enough to deal major damage when combined with entry hazards, especially against the likes of Rayquaza and Kyurem-W. With so many Dragon-types roaming around the tier, Dragon Tail becomes more useful than Roar for Gyarados, and it also wears down common counters such as Zekrom and Palkia. Bulkier threats such as Chansey and Giratina also hate the extra damage they take from Dragon Tail. Waterfall is the most consistent STAB move, and is mainly used to strike common threats it checks, such as Ho-Oh, Excadrill, Blaziken, Genesect, and Tyranitar. Even if the weather is sunny, Gyarados can break Ho-Oh's Substitutes with Waterfall, and cripple the phoenix with Toxic. In rain, Waterfall becomes a decently powerful attack, capable of 3HKOing the likes of Arceus and Chansey. Genesect lacking Thunder will have trouble killing Gyarados, making it an excellent switch-in to the most common Genesect set. Both of Blaziken's sets are walled, and Gyarados can just reply with Waterfall or Dragon Tail it out. Waterfall also comes along with a decent flinch rate, which can come in handy against defensive threats such as Forretress. Earthquake is a good alternative over Waterfall to hit Steel-types such as Dialga and Jirachi. With Earthquake, Gyarados can beat Dialga and Jirachi one-on-one, but will fail if they pack Thunder. Toxic is the best status move to use on this set, as it cripples walls. The combination of Toxic and Taunt can easily take down walls, as they can't heal the residual damage. Thunder Wave is a viable alternative, but Toxic has more use in general and limits the number of times a threat can come in to force out Gyarados.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>76 Speed EVs let Gyarados outrun and Taunt minimal invested base 90s, such as Groudon and Giratina, before they can use a support move; this extra Speed is crucial to Gyarados's success. 248 HP EVs give Gyarados a Stealth Rock number and maximum overall bulk. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense, as this set is meant to challenge physical threats with Intimidate. Gyarados is one of the very few Pokemon capable of surviving a boosted hit from the dreaded Swords Dance Rayquaza, as it resists V-Create. In return, Gyarados can phaze out Rayquaza with Dragon Tail, forcing it to take extra Stealth Rock damage the next time it switches in. While a +1 Outrage will, unfortunately, OHKO Gyarados, Rayquaza can then easily be revenge killed by Gyarados's teammates. Gyarados can also phaze out a boosted Arceus with Dragon Tail even after Stealth Rock damage, although Wish support is necessary to keep Gyarados alive longer.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the main Wish passers of the tier share great typing synergy with Gyarados. Jirachi and the pink blobs can easily take Thunders and Draco Meteors for Gyarados, while Gyarados can switch in on Earthquakes for free and shrug off Close Combats. Wishes from Blissey and Chansey can heal Gyarados back to almost full health, and although Jirachi passes smaller Wishes, it has a resistance to Rock-type attacks and has U-turn to give Gyarados more switch-in opportunities. Protect can be used to scout for Thunders and stack more Leftovers recovery, but Gyarados has better things to do most of the time.</p>

<p>Pairing Gyarados with a Rapid Spin user keeps it alive for longer. The best one to pair with Gyarados is obviously Excadrill, as they share perfect synergy with each other. Excadrill is the most likely spinner to pull off a successful Rapid Spin, and has a powerful Earthquake to smash Zekrom and Dialga, while resisting Dragon as well. Gyarados can check opposing Excadrill, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Fighting Arceus, Ho-Oh, and some Groudon, while providing Intimidate support to give more switch-in opportunities for Excadrill. Toxic from Gyarados can also cripple defensive threats aiming to wall Excadrill, such as Lugia and Ground Arceus. Forretress is another viable teammate for Rapid Spin support with its numerous resistances and access to every entry hazard, which enhances Gyarados's phazing prowess. Gyarados resists Forretress's only weakness and can check Heatran and Ho-Oh well. Intimidate can, once again, help Forretress survive longer, especially against powerful threats such as Choice Band Terrakion. While it shares an Electric-type weakness with Gyarados, Kabutops can perform well as an offensive spinner. It can outrun a large portion of the metagame under rain and hit any spinblocker not named Giratina hard. Gyarados can support Kabutops by checking Groudon and switching in on Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Terrakion and Fighting Arceus. Kabutops's access to Low Kick also allows it to take out Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Steel Arceus once they are weakened by Gyarados. The rare Gastrodon walls Kabutops, but it is easily stopped in its tracks by Gyarados through Taunt and Toxic.</p>

<p>You will need to pair Gyarados up with a spinblocker to keep entry hazards up on your opponent's side, as it maximizes Gyarados's ability to shuffle the opposing team. The Giratina formes are the best choices as they both resist Electric, and have huge bulk, amd both can phaze on their own as well. Gyarados can support them in walling through Intimidate, and checking certain Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Salamence, and Rayquaza. Ghost Arceus is capable of beating threats Gyarados will not enjoy facing, such as Latios and Mewtwo. In return, Gyarados can soften hits with Intimidate, Taunt annoying threats such as Forretress, and destroy Tyranitar, the main user of Pursuit in the tier, meaning Ghost Arceus is free to run Flamethrower instead of Focus Blast, maximizing its efficiency in spinblocking.</p>

<p>In terms of pure synergy, Gyarados fits right into just about any team. For rain teams, common teammates are Ferrothorn, Dialga, Grass Arceus, Excadrill, Steel Arceus, Jirachi, Gastrodon, and of course Kyogre. All of them are standard Pokemon found in rain teams, so Gyarados has no problem fitting in, and can act as a defensive pivot on such teams, by providing a useful Ground immunity, access to Taunt to break stall, and Intimidate to check physical threats. Ferrothorn shares perfect synergy with Gyarados, and can set up Spikes as well. It also gets Leech Seed to annoy foes, and can provide Gyarados with some extra healing, making Gyarados's annoying strategy even more effective. Gyarados's power is also maximized in the rain, giving Waterfall a much needed power boost to actually hurt things. Although Thunder always hits in rain, all of Gyarados's teammates are capable of taking Thunders and Stone Edges easily, save Kyogre, who enjoys Gyarados's Intimidate support and ability to switch in on offensive Groudon and Excadrill spamming Earthquake.</p>

<p>For sand teams, Tyranitar and Hippowdon love Gyarados's ability to check Fighting Arceus, opposing Excadrill, Groudon, and Steel Arceus. Although Hippowdon can take on Excadrill and Groudon on its own, Gyarados can assist it with Intimidate support; both also enjoy Gyarados's ability to defeat defensive Kyogre and make Spikes users useless. All of Tyranitar's common weaknesses are resisted by Gyarados, while Tyranitar can easily tank Thunders and Pursuit its users to death. Hippowdon can form a powerful physically defensive core with Gyarados, as it can wall Zekrom and Terrakion, both of whom are problematic threats for Gyarados. Groudon has huge Defense, resists both of Gyarados's weaknesses, and can set up Stealth Rock, as well as roast Steel-types with a Fire-type attack. Gyarados can check Ho-Oh and stop Giratina from doing anything. Gyarados can also take on defensive Kyogre&mdash; who loves to switch in on Groudon&mdash;but a burn can be disastrous. In the sun, Thunder's accuracy is reduced to an unreliable 50%, so Gyarados can be a lot harder to OHKO. When paired with Groudon, Gyarados should use another move over Waterfall, such as Stone Edge, to take out Ho-Oh and Reshiram. Keep in mind that Gyarados functions best in rain or sand due to sun's already limited playstyle.</p>

</ul>

[Other Options]

<p>A set with Substitute and Dragon Dance can be used to set up on defensive Pokemon, but it has coverage issues and will either be too slow, or too weak. Roar can be an alternative over Dragon Tail on the first set to phaze out Substitute users, but Taunt already prevents that, and Dragon Tail utilizes Gyarados's good Attack stat. Water + Dragon also happens to have pretty good coverage in Ubers, striking most Dragon-types who resist Water for super effective damage. Substitute can be used on the first set to protect Gyarados from status, but Taunt is generally the better move to stop defensive threats, and Scald isn't that common in Ubers. Gyarados can use other sets, but they are not really effective in the Uber tier. It can also set up on defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Forretress. A Choice Band set can be used for sheer power while still packing some bulk, but Kabutops is generally better for that thanks to Swift Swim and a powerful secondary STAB move. Rest and Sleep Talk can be used for more recovery, but Gyarados already suffers from 4 moveslot syndrome, and it will be useless when sleeping, especially with the new sleep mechanics. Avalanche can be used to directly OHKO Dragon-types such as Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Salamence, and deal a good amount of damage to Giratina-O, but Dragon Tail is better for phazing. Moxie can be used with Choice Scarf to sweep the opponent, but Gyarados is too slow for that, and Salamence is generally the better choice with its superior Attack and Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Pokemon that packs an Electric-type move and is bulky enough to take an attack from Gyarados can easily force it out. These threats include Kyogre, Palkia, Dialga, and Zekrom; however, none of them will enjoy taking repeated Dragon Tails combined with entry hazard damage. If they do get in safely though, Gyarados has to switch out or get OHKOed. None of them will enjoy a Toxic to the face either, except Dialga, who hates taking Earthquake, but has good enough Defense to take at least one hit and KO back with Thunder. Zekrom has huge physical Defense so it can survive an Earthquake easily, and Bolt Strike will OHKO, but it does not like taking Dragon Tails on the switch; Kyurem-B can achieve the same thing with Fusion Bolt. Groudon cannot KO Gyarados quickly, but it has huge Defense, and the sun it brings weakens Gyarados's Waterfall. Groudon will not enjoy Toxic, however, and has to be wary of Dragon Tail if it tries to set up Swords Dance. Groudon's Stone Edge fails to OHKO Gyarados, but it can chip off the damage easily due to Gyarados's lack of recovery, assuming Groudon is switching into Gyarados, not the other way round. Mixed attacker Giratina-O resists Waterfall and can take out Gyarados easily with Thunder, or just tear out a chunk of its HP with Draco Meteor.</p>

<p>Ferrothorn can't do much to Gyarados, but it can wear Gyarados down with repeated Power Whips and Iron Barbs, especially when Intimidate is not in effect. If Spikes are up, however, Ferrothorn will not like switching repeatedly on Dragon Tails as it cannot recover with Leech Seed due to Taunt. Darkrai can put Gyarados to sleep with Dark Void and take it out with a boosted Dark Pulse, as long as Darkrai does not come in on Taunt. However, Darkrai does not like taking Waterfalls on the switch, as it will 2HKO. Mewtwo can bypass Intimidate and strike Gyarados hard with Psystrike or fry it with Thunder, however it too will not like switching into Waterfalls in rain. Shaymin-S resists Waterfall and can foil Toxic attempts with a faster Substitute. From there, Shaymin-S can 2HKO Gyarados with Seed Flare. If Terrakion manages to come in safely, its Choice Band set can KO Gyarados. Kabutops can survive one hit and strike back hard with Stone Edge, a guaranteed OHKO with Choice Band. In general, Stealth Rock will hinder Gyarados's ability to switch in freely and repeated hits will bring it down eventually.</p>
