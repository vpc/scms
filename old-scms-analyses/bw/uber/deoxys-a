[Overview]

<p>The epitome of offense, Deoxys-A is a true powerhouse in every sense of the word. Between its unrivaled base 180 attacking stats (the highest in the game), blistering base 150 Speed, and fantastic movepool, including the coveted ExtremeSpeed, Deoxys-A has everything it needs to tear gaping holes in the opposing team. Stealth Rock and Spikes let it serve as a suicide or attacking lead with unparalleled offenses, being able to ward off every user of Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce in the game! Unfortunately, its poor typing and practically nonexistent defenses offer no defensive synergy to its team, and because even relatively weak neutral attacks will easily knock it out, it usually needs extensive team support to pull off a clean sweep. The fact that it is easily revenge killed by users of Choice Scarf and priority moves—even Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave—also make it difficult for Deoxys-A to find a place on a team. Couple this with the fact Deoxys-A is walled by certain Pokemon depending on what move it forgoes and you can see why it's rarely seen in the Ubers tier. These faults aside, however, Deoxys-A is certainly a threat to prepare for.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Presenting Deoxys-A's bread and butter set, one of the tier's premier offensive anti-leads. This set can take on most leads in the current metagame and come out on top. If you thought Draco Meteor spam was impressive, think again: Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost is even more powerful, and does an immense amount of damage to anything that isn't outright immune to Psychic. For reference, Psycho Boost does 90.6% - 106.8% to Rayquaza! Ice Beam and Dark Pulse both improve Deoxys-A's coverage by allowing it to hit Latios and Latias. The former also provides Deoxys-A with a move to hit Rayquaza and Groudon outside of Psycho Boost while the latter allows Deoxys-A to hit its Psychic brethren, namely Deoxys-S, Deoxys, and Cresselia, super effectively, all the while providing a handy 20% flinch chance. Superpower is a move similar to Psycho Boost, albeit physically based, and hits Steel- and Dark-types that resist or are immune to Psycho Boost for super effective damage. This notably allows Deoxys-A to revenge kill non-Focus Sash Darkrai. Hidden Power Fire allows Deoxys-A to quickly OHKO Forretress and Ferrothorn. It should be noted that if Deoxys-A lacks Hidden Power Fire, then it will have great difficulty hurting Forretress, as it resists all other moves Deoxys-A can throw at it barring Superpower&mdash;which it easily absorbs thanks to its high Defense. However, without Superpower, Deoxys-A will find itself walled by Chansey. ExtremeSpeed is great for taking out weakened opponents such as Focus Sash Deoxys-S, and lands a decent hit on Choice Scarf users attempting to revenge kill Deoxys-A. It also provides mid-game revenge killing utility should Deoxys-A survive that long, which happens surprisingly often. However, it can be replaced with a coverage move if your team doesn't have much trouble with revenge killers and doesn't mind Deoxys-S nabbing an extra layer of Spikes on you.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Max Speed and Special Attack with a Naive nature are used to make the most of Deoxys-A's amazing offensive stats, as its Defense is so poor that it will not survive any hits; in any case, it utilizes a Focus Sash. The remaining 4 EVs should go into Attack to boost Superpower and ExtremeSpeed. In particular, this Speed investment allows Deoxys-A to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre and other neutral-natured base 90 Speed Choice Scarf users. A Rash nature, however, is also usable. An alternative spread of 16 Atk / 252 SpA / 240 Spe with a Rash nature allows Deoxys-A to still outpace Mewtwo and other base 130 Speed Pokemon, taking into account Hidden Power Fire's imperfect Speed IV. Using max Speed in tandem with Hidden Power Fire with a Rash nature is not advised, as the point lost in Speed will prevent a Speed tie with opposing Deoxys-A, the only common Pokemon with base 150 Speed, so dropping to 395 Speed (just above the base 130 Speed tier) and shifting the remaining EVs to Attack is the preferred choice. Deoxys-A also has the option of running Magic Coat, Fire Punch, Thunder, Grass Knot, or Ice Punch. Magic Coat allows Deoxys-A to reflect Spikes and Dark Void back at Deoxys-S and Darkrai respectively, if you can predict correctly. Fire Punch provides solid coverage while preserving perfect IVs, but it will be slightly weaker than Hidden Power Fire due to unequal offensive investment. Thunder is reliant on rain, but it allows Deoxys-A to hit enemy Deoxys, Forretress, Kyogre, Lugia, and Ho-Oh hard. Grass Knot allows Deoxys-A to always OHKO defensive Groudon without the Psycho Boost stat drops, but its inability to hit Steel-types burdens Deoxys-A. Lastly, Ice Punch can be used over Ice Beam solely for enemy Latios and Latias.</p>

<p>As a dedicated lead, Deoxys-A does not require much support from the team. Should you forgo Magic Coat, a sleep absorber will be necessary, as Choice Scarf Darkrai will outspeed and incapacitate Deoxys-A with Dark Void before it can use Superpower. RestTalk + Calm Mind Kyogre is a great teammate in this regard as it does not mind being put to sleep and can retaliate with Sleep Talk, either drowning Darkrai with Scald or setting up for an early sweep with Calm Mind. Beware of switching Kyogre into a Trick, however, as a Choice item will cripple it. If Deoxys-A lacks Hidden Power Fire, lead Scizor can also cause problems; fortunately, a defensive Kyogre is generally an apt switch-in to most Scizor as well. Though not commonly seen as leads, Giratina-O and Extreme Killer Arceus can take Deoxys-A out with consecutive Shadow Sneaks and ExtremeSpeeds respectively, but Psycho Boost will deal severe damage to them. Dialga can easily switch into a resisted Shadow Sneak and scare Giratina-O out or OHKO with STAB Dragon-type moves. While entry hazards might seem odd on an attacking lead, the immense offensive threat Deoxys-A presents can often force switches, which gives it an opportunity to get Stealth Rock or a layer of Spikes onto the field.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Deoxys-A's ability to force many switches and access to entry hazards, coupled with the ability to destroy all users of Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce, allows it to become a fantastic user of Stealth Rock and Spikes. The decision between Stealth Rock and Spikes is based on your team's needs. Stealth Rock takes only one turn to setup, and affects all types of Pokemon. Spikes, on the other hand, deals consistent damage to all non-Flying-type Pokemon. Psycho Boost hits extremely hard, and allows Deoxys-A to deal heavy damage to enemy leads. The third slot is reserved for Deoxys-A's coverage needs. Both moves allow Deoxys-A to hit Steel-types, but both have their notable attributes. Superpower allows Deoxys-A to dent Dialga and OHKO enemy Tyranitar, while Hidden Power Fire can bring Forretress down to Sturdy and OHKO enemy Ferrothorn. It should be noted that both Superpower and Hidden Power Fire can take up the last two slots if you wish to have insurance against Tyranitar, Dialga, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. The last slot is also based on the team's needs. Ice Beam allows Deoxys-A to OHKO Rayquaza and crush Groudon without resorting to Psycho Boost. ExtremeSpeed 2HKOes Deoxys-S, and limits the amount of hazards it can setup. Lastly, Dark Pulse provides solid coverage against enemy Psychic-types, notably Deoxys-D, who would otherwise have no problem setting up hazards against Deoxys-A.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As a suicide lead, Deoxys-A doesn't really need teammates to help it do its job, but there are many teammates that appreciate hazards on the field. Sweepers such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Extreme Killer Arceus enjoy having hazards on the opponent's side of the field, as it greatly helps them sweep the opposition. This coupled with Deoxys-A's ability to prevent hazards from going up on its side of the field (thanks to the fact its foes will try to knock it out to avoid getting mauled), allows Deoxys-A to even better help a Pokemon sweep. There are, however, a few teammates Deoxys-A needs. A spinblocker such as Giratina or Ghost Arceus is needed so that the hazards Deoxys-A sets up will not be spun away. Additionally, Pokemon that can switch into priority moves, such as Shadow Sneak or ExtremeSpeed, are welcome. Dialga, in particular, makes a great partner. It can easily switch into a Shadow Sneak from Giratina and threaten to OHKO back with Draco Meteor. Dialga can also threaten any users of Rapid Spin with Fire Blast and Draco Meteor and provide Stealth Rock support, which allows Deoxys-A to run Spikes.</p>

<p>Deoxys-A can run moves not listed on the set, but note that Deoxys-A will lose coverage. There is only one viable move not listed, and that is Thunder, which can be used in the fourth slot as a hybrid between Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire. Thunder is Deoxys-A's strongest move against Skarmory, and allows Deoxys-A to hit enemy Psychic- and Steel-types neutrally, hitting Forretress a lot harder then Superpower. Thunder, however, is reliant on rain, and as this Deoxys-A is designed to lead, it might be impossible to make Thunder accurate.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Psycho Boost
move 2: Ice Beam / Dark Pulse
move 3: Superpower
move 4: ExtremeSpeed / Hidden Power Fire
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive / Rash
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>For a Pokemon that can't take a hit but has unparalleled power, what better item is there than Life Orb? Such an attacking set is one of Deoxys-A's best options, and its execution is simple: simply select the correct coverage move and decimate the opponent. Psycho Boost is the preferred move, as it provides STAB and acts much like Latios's Draco Meteor in OU: spam it and things die. Ice Beam is useful for its great coverage over the tier, OHKOing Pokemon such as Groudon, Rayquaza, Shaymin-S, Garchomp, and Zekrom without resorting to Psycho Boost, while also giving Deoxys-A the best chance to 2HKO specially defensive Giratina and hitting Latios and Latias hard. Dark Pulse, on the other hand, allows Deoxys-A to defeat all of its Psychic brethren, 2HKOing Deoxys-D and Cresselia, Pokemon that Deoxys-A otherwise struggles to defeat, while also hitting Latios hard and even OHKOing offensive Mewtwo. It is also Deoxys-A's only move aside from Shadow Ball that can OHKO offensive Mewtwo. Superpower allows Deoxys-A to OHKO Chansey, Darkrai, and Blissey while providing Deoxys-A with the ability to hit Steel-types super effectively. The final slot is a toss-up; Hidden Power Fire provides coverage against Ferrothorn in situations where the Attack drop from Superpower is not welcome and OHKOes Forretress outside of Sturdy, but it only nabs the OHKO on both in neutral or sunny weather. If Ferrothorn and Forretress are not issues, ExtremeSpeed is a great option to take down weakened revenge killers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because Deoxys-A is so versatile, its moveset can be molded to suit your team. Thunder, Grass Knot, Spikes, and Ice Punch are all good alternative moves that Deoxys-A can use. Thunder, although reliant on weather, allows Deoxys-A to hit enemy Steel- and Psychic-types hard. It is also Deoxys-A's best move against Skarmory and Lugia in the rain, as it can OHKO both after Stealth Rock. Grass Knot hits Kyogre and Groudon hard without the need for Psycho Boost stat drops, but its lack of coverage outside of hitting the two often makes it a poor choice. Ice Punch might seem outclassed by Ice Beam at first glance, but it gives Deoxys-A the best chance at OHKOing Latios and Latios, who avoid the OHKO from Ice Beam thanks to Soul Dew; it should be mentioned that it also hits Giratina and Lugia a lot less harder though. Spikes might seem awkward on a set designed to destroy its enemies, but Deoxys-A's massive potential for destruction gives it time to set up multiple layers of Spikes. Do be careful if you use Spikes though, as predicting incorrectly will result in a dead Deoxys-A.</p>

<p>Deoxys-A has some alternative natures and spreads it can use aside from those listed. Maximum Speed along with a Naive nature enables Deoxys-A to outspeed everything up to +1 neutral-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf and Dragon Dance Rayquaza. A Rash or Mild nature is completely viable. An alternate spread of 24 Atk / 252 SpA / 232 Spe and a Mild nature provides more more power at the cost of speed, allowing Deoxys-A to OHKO and 2HKO threats that it had trouble with earlier, such as specially defensive Giratina, as well as Multiscale-less Lugia, and Latias without the need for Stealth Rock. Deoxys-A can also invest in its Attack stat, as its special attacks already have a lot of power. A set of 184 Atk / 88 SpA / 236 Spe is viable, as it provides a massive boost to Superpower and ExtremeSpeed, giving the former a chance to OHKO support Dialga, Ferrothorn, and Chansey. It is recommended to use a Rash nature with this though, as a Rash Psycho Boost boosted by 88 Special Attack EVs is stronger then a Naive Psycho Boost boosted by 252 Special Attack EVs.</p>

<p>There are a few partners that Deoxys-A always enjoys having on its side. As it is susceptible to revenge killing, Wobbuffet is a good partner to get rid of Choice Scarf users; it can also Encore harmless moves to give Deoxys-A a safe switch-in. Steel-types can cause trouble for Deoxys-A, especially in rain, as several of them are hit neutrally by Superpower, so Magnezone is another good partner, trapping these Pokemon and potentially setting up on them with Substitute and Charge Beam or OHKOing them with Thunder. Deoxys-A's frailty greatly hurts its ability to get in safely, so partners that can get Deoxys-A safely in with U-turn or Volt Switch&mdash;namely Genesect, Scizor, Forretress, and Zekrom&mdash;are welcome. Deoxys-A has the tendency to cause a lot of switches in a match and wants as much residual damage on the team as possible so that it can have the best chance to sweep. This means Deoxys-A appreciates having a partner that can use entry hazards such as Ferrothorn. Forretress can do this job well too. It can setup multiple hazards and allow Deoxys-A to switch back in easily thanks to its slow Volt Switch and Explosion.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A few Choice items might come to mind when looking at Deoxys-A's stats. After all, base 180 in each offensive stat is nothing to scoff at. However, there are some huge issues with Choice Deoxys-A. The inability to change moves means Deoxys-A will have to switch often, particularly as Psycho Boost and Superpower both lower Deoxys-A's stats and cannot hit Dark- and Ghost-types respectively. Also, thanks to its abysmal defenses, Deoxys-A can pretty much only switch in after a teammate has fainted. Furthermore, Life Orb-boosted attacks already hit so hard that Pokemon which are not 2HKOed are few and far between. Choice Specs is incredibly strong though, capable of OHKOing even 252 HP Arceus. A Choice Scarf is also unnecessary, as base 150 Speed is already amazing, and to outspeed revenge killers by such large a margin is rather pointless when Deoxys-A could just switch out.</p>

<p>As for move choices, thanks to its stellar offensive stats, Deoxys-A can make use of just about any decently powerful move in its arsenal; your other teammates should determine which moves it runs. However, there are a few moves that stand out. Psyshock is the first, as it can 2HKO Chansey without the need for Superpower's stat drops. Low Kick is another option which hits many heavy Uber Pokemon for a good amount of damage, while once more avoiding Superpower's negative effects. The combination of the two work well together, "persuading" Chansey not to switch in. Deoxys-A's ability to force many switches can be used to set up free Substitutes, which not only lengthen Deoxys-A's longevity but also ease prediction, as Deoxys-A no longer has to worry about using the wrong move and allowing a check to switch in. Pursuit also takes advantage of Deoxys-A's ability to force switches, killing or greatly weakening any Pokemon that dares switch out against Deoxys-A. Shadow Ball is an alternative to Dark Pulse if you fear that you might accidentally hit a Terrakion with the move and allow it to nab a boost in Attack, but its inability to hit Normal-types might allow Extreme Killer Arceus to switch in freely and proceed to kill Deoxys-A with ExtremeSpeed. Icy Wind and Low Sweep allow Deoxys-A to alleviate its issues with fast Choice Scarf Pokemon, but it should be noted that these moves are extremely weak. Signal Beam allows Deoxys-A to hit Darkrai and Mewtwo super effectively with one move, but it is quite weak and Bug-type moves provide terrible coverage on the rest of the tier. Taunt allows Deoxys-A to prevent a Pokemon from healing itself, but it should be noted that the turn Deoxys-A uses this move could have been dedicated to hitting the opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There are no true counters to Deoxys-A as its expansive movepool means it might be carrying a move that hits said switch-in super effectively. There is, however, one thing that can be considered close to a counter, and that is specially defensive Psychic Arceus. Specially defensive Psychic Arceus can easily switch into any move Deoxys-A has and proceed to outspeed and kill it the turn after with ExtremeSpeed. Deoxys-A also has many checks, some of which are listed above. To reiterate, anything faster than it or packing priority can reliably eliminate Deoxys-A. Most Choice Scarf users, such as Genesect, Palkia, Dialga, Jirachi, and Terrakion, are bulky enough to take an ExtremeSpeed and KO back with just about any move; however, it must be noted that neutral-natured +1 base 90 Speed Pokemon will not outspeed max Speed Deoxys-A. Deoxys-A is also greatly annoyed by Chlorophyll, Sand Rush, and Swift Swim users in their respective weathers, as they can outspeed and KO Deoxys-A with a STAB move. Giratina, Arceus, Beartic, and Scizor can annoy Deoxys-A with Shadow Sneak, ExtremeSpeed, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet, forcing Deoxys-A to switch out unless it wishes to be KOed. There are some walls that, should Deoxys-A lack a certain move for them, can create problems for it. Latios and Latias can both comfortably take any hit barring Life Orb-boosted Ice Punch and KO back with Dragon Pulse. Specially defensive Latias makes an even better check, as it is capable of stomaching two Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulses and can proceed to Recover the damage off, set up Light Screen to take hits with more ease, or just KO Deoxys-A with Dragon Pulse. Specially defensive Giratina also avoids being 2HKOed by any move bar Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam and can proceed to KO Deoxys-A back with Dragon Tail. If Deoxys-A lacks Thunder and Stealth Rock is not up, defensive Ho-Oh can cause problems, as it can tank hits comfortably with its massive Special Defense. Lugia is another specially defensive wall that can survive most of Deoxys-A's moves and easily KO back. Bulky Steel-types such as Scizor, Metagross, Forretress, Jirachi, and Bronzong will cause problems for Deoxys-A lacking a Fire-type move and can OHKO back with a STAB move. Scizor and Metagross in particular boast STAB Bullet Punch to knock Deoxys-A out before it moves. Wobbuffet, Cresselia, and Deoxys-D can easily switch into Deoxys-A lacking Dark Pulse. They can then OHKO Deoxys-A with Mirror Coat and Ice Beam, respectively, or proceed to cripple it with status. While rare, ExtremeSpeed Deoxys-S KOes its attacking brethren unless a Substitute is in the way.</p>
