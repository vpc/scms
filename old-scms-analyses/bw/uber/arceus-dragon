[Overview]
<p>The Creator assumes the guise of the mythical dragon of yore upon donning the Draco Plate. Writhe in horror as the Original One reveals the true power of the dragon, and dare not incur His divine wrath unless you are imbued with the power of cold steel, lest ye be squashed by His Outrage. Dragon Arceus absorbs fiery blasts and the torrential downpours in His draconian guise with His wonderful bulk and scaly hide, but shudders when confronted with the frigid blasts of Ice-types and the powerful blows of his fellow Dragons. Despite these flaws, dare not confront Dragon Arceus unless you are fully prepared for it, or all you hold dear will be obliterated in an instant.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Dragon Arceus may not look like much when compared to more threatening Arceus formes such as the Extreme Killer, its STAB Outrage poses a major threat, and its own ExtremeSpeed still deals respectable amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. With its fantastic offensive stats, Dragon Arceus has no difficulty pulling off a Swords Dance set, hitting a mind-boggling 678 Attack stat after just one turn of setup. What sets it apart from other Arceus formes utilizing Swords Dance (Normal Arceus in particular) is the incredible power of its STAB Outrage, which blasts common Dragon-types as well as anything that doesn't resist it into oblivion. Earthquake pairs wonderfully with Outrage, smashing the Steel-types who resist Outrage. Finally, ExtremeSpeed finishes off weakened threats in addition to severely hurting healthy Choice Scarf users who wish to revenge kill Dragon Arceus. However, it must be noted that Steel-types immune to Earthquake, such as Bronzong and Skarmory, will completely wall Dragon Arceus, the latter phazing Arceus with ease.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is straightforward; it allows Dragon Arceus to hit as hard as possible while still outspeeding positive-natured Thundurus, Latios, and Choice Band Terrakion, as well as potentially winning the Speed tie with opposing Steel Arceus to KO with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Zekrom can survive a +2 ExtremeSpeed and give Dragon Arceus a taste of its own medicine by revenge killing it with Outrage. Thus, walls such as Lugia and Groudon are great teammates for Dragon Arceus, as they can check these threats with ease. Ferrothorn does a fantastic job as well, KOing or severely hurting Garchomp and Zekrom with Gyro Ball and Iron Barbs, even though the latter has a Steel-type resistance resists Steel-type attacks. Specially based Choice Scarf users such as Dialga and Palkia are also a headache for Dragon Arceus, so special walls such as Chansey and Blissey make good teammates for Dragon Arceus. Chansey and Blissey, in addition to sponging special attacks, Chansey and Blissey can support Dragon Arceus very well with Wish and Heal Bell, and cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave. Skarmory will also wall this set, making Magnezone a great partner for Dragon Arceus, as it can trap and eliminate Steel-types with ease. As usual, Encore support from Wobbuffet is extremely valuable, as it all but guarantees Dragon Arceus a Swords Dance boost.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As only Steel-types resist Dragon-type attacks, Dragon Arceus can run a very effective Calm Mind set. While not providing a large offensive boost, Calm Mind also raises Dragon Arceus's already-immense special bulk to massive levels, letting it set up fearlessly on special attackers. This is made easier by the fact that Dragon Arceus packs useful resistances to Fire- and Grass-type attacks, allowing it to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Kyogre. After a Calm Mind, STAB Judgment will dish out a massive amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it, OHKOing or 2HKOing every neutral target in Ubers. Fire Blast complements Judgment well by finishing off Steel-types who hope to switch in, allowing Dragon Arceus to roast both Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which is very useful considering the fact that the latter completely walls Dragon Arceus otherwise. However, Substitute can be used to protect Dragon Arceus from status, allowing it to survive powerful attacks from the likes of Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and KO with super effective Judgment.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs are fairly straightforward, maximizing Dragon Arceus's Speed while boosting its overall bulk considerably. An alternate spread of 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe can be used with Substitute to bolster its offenses, while allowing it to create 101 HP substitutes in order to set up on Blissey and Chansey, who cannot hope to break them with one Seismic Toss. Alternatively, Dragon Arceus can run a fully offensive spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, allowing it to hit much harder with less set-up. Refresh is used to eliminate status if Substitute is not an option. Finally, Flamethrower can be used instead of Fire Blast if you are worried about accuracy, but it is significantly weaker.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dragon Arceus has a few alternative options it can use. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Zekrom, but Dragon Arceus has trouble finding a moveslot on all of its sets. Overheat can provide coverage on the Swords Dance set to hit Steel-types immune to Earthquake, but it can't even 2HKO Careful Skarmory and Sassy Bronzong, nor can it OHKO Sassy Ferrothorn without sun support; in rain, it does pathetic damage even to Ferrothorn, and therefore is definitely not worth the moveslot.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Physical Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom and Garchomp are the best checks to Dragon Arceus, as they will outspeed and OHKO it with Outrage while surviving a boosted ExtremeSpeed. Special attacking Choice Scarf users such as Palkia can revenge kill the Swords Dance set, but will fall to the Calm Mind sets. None of them can switch into Dragon Arceus, though, as Judgment or Outrage will lay the smack down on them. Steel-types neutral or immune to Earthquake, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, can take Dragon Arceus's boosted attacks with ease, and phaze it or smack it hard with Gyro Ball, respectively; however, they do need to watch out for Fire Blast, which will smash them to bits. Chansey and Blissey wall the Calm Mind set and can stall out Dragon Arceus with Toxic and Wish. Lugia survives a boosted Outrage or Judgment and can phaze Dragon Arceus with Whirlwind or Dragon Tail.</p>
