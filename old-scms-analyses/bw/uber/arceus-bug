[OVERVIEW]

<p>Dare not underestimate the capabilities of Arceus, for even when in the guise of a lowly Bug-type, ravaged by Stealth Rock, He cannot be squashed! His stats flawless, His versatility unmatched, His Bug-type Judgment shall rain down even upon the realm of giants, scoring super effective coverage upon any Dark- or Psychic-type foolish enough to come before Him. Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks leave but a scratch on His near-impenetrable hide. Though Arceus may give a semblance of the humble Bug-type with an aversion to Fire- and Flying-type moves, do not let this facade of weakness deceive you; even super effective hits do not make a great impression upon Arceus's superb bulk. Truly, even as a humble insect, Arceus's prowess is unparalleled.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bug Arceus is one of few Bug-types capable of running an effective specially offensive set in Ubers. Bug is a poor defensive typing, as it is weak to not only Fire-type attacks, but more importantly, Stealth Rock. Offensively, however, it ranks among the very best. STAB Bug-type moves have excellent neutral coverage in Ubers, and also hit important Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo super effectively. However, Pokemon such as Giratina and Reshiram can still take Bug-type moves with ease; this is where Arceus's coverage move comes into play. Ice Beam does a meaty 49.3% - 58.4% to Giratina after a Calm Mind, which is a guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock, while Rayquaza is OHKOed. As an alternative, Spacial Rend has greater Base Power and hits Palkia and Reshiram super effectively. However, it comes at the cost of the 4x super effective hit on Rayquaza and Garchomp, as well as slightly lower accuracy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Blast can give Arceus coverage on Steel- and Rock-types, but its 70% accuracy is fairly unreliable. Bug Arceus is fully capable of running a bulky set, eschewing immediate power for greater bulk and the ability to bag more Calm Minds. If you wish to use this, then a Calm or Bold nature is recommended, with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe.</p>

<p>Dialga has excellent synergy with Bug Arceus, and can take out most of its checks, with the possible exceptions of Ho-Oh and Terrakion. Dialga can even set up the crucial Stealth Rock, softening up walls and making Ho-Oh less of a threat. Forretress is probably the best Stealth Rock user in the game, and can even remove Stealth Rock from the field for Bug Arceus. However, if using Forretress, one must be sure to pack a Water-type, such as Kyogre, to negate the Fire-type weakness both Bug Arceus and Forretress bring on board. Kyogre functions effectively as a partner in its own right as well, as it checks Groudon and Ho-Oh, the latter of whom tears Bug Arceus apart.</p>

[Set]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance

move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Earthquake / Recover
item: Insect Plate
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>After a single Swords Dance, Bug Arceus reaches a massive Attack stat of 678, which is enough to crush any unprepared opponent. X-Scissor is its obligatory STAB attack and due to the popularity of Psychic-types, has great coverage in the tier. Stone Edge allows Bug Arceus to hit Flying-types such as Rayquaza and Ho-Oh for super effective damage. Earthquake, on the other hand, covers Dialga and other Steel-types. Recover can be used in place of Earthquake for a reliable recovery move, giving Bug Arceus some staying power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>ExtremeSpeed is a viable option in the fourth slot, as it enables Arceus to snipe off weakened foes. Kyogre makes an excellent partner to Bug Arceus; it can easily dispose of Groudon and Ho-Oh with its rain-boosted STAB Water-type moves, and can negate Bug Arceus's weakness to Fire-type moves thanks to Drizzle. Dialga has good synergy with Bug Arceus, and can set up Stealth Rock to soften up counters, especially Ho-Oh. Furthermore, Dialga can easily dispose of many of Bug Arceus's counters.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Bug Arceus has a massive movepool, but many of the moves it receives are not competitively viable. Bug Arceus can use Cosmic Power, but other formes are more adept at this. If you can provide it with rain support, feel free to use Thunder on the Calm Mind set. Earth Power and Fire Blast are good coverage moves to use. However, Bug Arceus would lose coverage against Flying-types if it gives up Ice Beam to fit one of them in. Substitute can be used to block status and beat Blissey one-on-one, but has little use outside that.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ho-Oh can easily eliminate Bug Arceus with either of its STAB attacks thanks to its massive Attack stat. Chansey and Blissey can easily handle the Calm Mind set, but if Bug Arceus is able to set up multiple Calm Minds, Blissey will fall. Groudon can wall the Swords Dance set, increase Bug Arceus's Fire-type weakness by summoning sun, and do great damage with Stone Edge or Fire Punch. Skarmory is another useful counter to the Swords Dance set, as it takes only neutral damage from Stone Edge, has massive physical bulk, and can Whirlwind Bug Arceus away. Choice Scarf Terrakion can handle both sets, provided it does not switch in on an Earthquake or Focus Blast. Fire- and Dragon-types can fire off Fire Blasts, while Reshiram can turn Bug Arceus into a pile of ash with its STAB Blue Flare. Heatran does the same, but to a lesser extent. Other Arceus formes, namely Steel and Fire Arceus, can set up alongside Bug Arceus and beat it thanks to their type advantage. Bulk Up Dialga can defeat the Calm Mind set one-on-one due to its typing and bulk; however, it must watch out for the rare Earth Power or Focus Blast. Giratina can switch into the Swords Dance set and cripple Bug Arceus with Will-O-Wisp.</p>
