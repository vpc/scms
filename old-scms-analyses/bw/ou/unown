[Overview]

<p>Some may prefer Alakazam as their Psychic-type of choice, probably thanks to its magnificent moustache, or perhaps the slow and ugly Reuniclus. However, Unown does the job of a Psychic-type just as well this generation as always. To be blunt, it is <em>unknown</em> why one would choose not to use Unown. Unchanged from DPP, it deals with most of the OU threats that would otherwise roam free&mdash;unless it gets hit first, of course.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Unown's master moveset, perfect and beautiful in its design. Unown is the most versatile of all Pokemon; it can choose from any of the three suggested Hidden Powers to counter the great powerhouses of OU. The damage calculations below showcase its might against the puny Dragon-types and other plebeians weak to Hidden Power Ice:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Ice vs. 0 HP / 0- SpD Tornadus: 76.25 - 90.3%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Ice vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Haxorus: 77.55 - 91.83%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Ice vs. 12 HP / 0 SpD Breloom: 97.72 - 115.15%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Ice vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Salamence: 104.56 - 123.85%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Ice vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Gliscor: 122.03 - 144.63%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Ice vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Landorus-T: 129.15 - 152.97%</li>
</ul>

<p>It can even OHKO Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage! Unown becomes so powerful that it is also able to crush many other dangerous OU threats, swiftly dispatching them to the depths of Hell they should have never left, should it choose Hidden Power Fighting:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Fighting vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Magnezone: 65.95 - 78.01%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Fighting vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Mamoswine: 71.46 - 84.21%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Fighting vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Tyranitar: 99.41 - 118.12%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Fighting vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Magikarp: 145.05 - 170.87%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Fighting vs. 0 HP / 0- SpD Cloyster: 147.71 - 174.27%</li>
</ul>

<p>But that's not all! The third option, being the powerful STAB Psychic-type Hidden Power, will tear to shreds other important opposing forces, such as:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Venusaur: 84.38 - 100.33%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Keldeo: 86.06 - 102.16%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Terrakion: 86.06 - 102.16%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Conkeldurr: 87.43 - 103.38%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 0 HP / 0- SpD Cloyster: 110.78 - 130.7%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Gengar: 123.66 - 146.56%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 12 HP / 0 SpD Breloom: 146.21 - 172.72%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Magikarp: 217.58 - 256.04%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Toxicroak: 235.06 - 277.92%</li>
</ul>

<p>After all, who doesn't want almighty and powerful sweepers like Magikarp OHKOed? Unown is a solid staple in any team and it will not deceive you. The ability to OHKO Toxicroak with its superior Psychic-type powers will come in handy when you have to face the troublesome rain teams that plague the current metagame. All of the OU powerhouses will, ultimately, fall to Unown's might.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You could run a Timid nature, but Unown does not need to be fast; remember, it has the superb Hidden Power at its disposal. However, the all-powerful Unown will probably have just one chance to attack before it faints, so it may need the Speed against faster foes.</p>

<p>Because Dark-types are mean to Unown and will try to Crunch its feeble body, it's generally a good idea to team it up with bullies such as Conkeldurr or Terrakion, who will gladly take the attack and answer with a brutal, well-thrown Fighting-type move. Lucario, the OU Fighting-type outcast, will gladly help Unown as well with its powerful ExtremeSpeed. The mean Ghost-types of OU, Gengar and Jellicent, as well as the hyped-up but less powerful Psychic-types, Alakazam and Reuniclus, may try to hit Unown with a pesky Shadow Ball; therefore it is recommended to pair Blissey or Chansey with Unown, as they will gladly take Shadow Ball. Steel-types that can deal with these opponents are also helpful, such as Skarmory and Heatran, as they are friendly towards Unown and respect it enough to protect its life and vanquish its foes. Unown will enjoy any type of support your team can give: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Light Screen, Reflect, and spreading paralysis help it shine and let it do its work. In fact, it's highly recommended that you enact your support before letting Unown unleash its fury because, as they say, you'd be better safe than sorry.</p>

<p>Unown might not look like the fittest member of your team, but it is a really solid Pokemon that's remained throughout the years because it's never had to change at all! Unown's great power, coverage and movepool allow it to sweep unprepared teams that are unaware of its might.</p>

[SET]

evs: 252 SpA / 4 HP / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Whilst this set does not grant the incredible damage Choice Specs Unown can deal, being the speediest in the current metagame&mdash;faster than those living in the modern world&mdash;is key to success. The most powerful Unown can outspeed several foes with a Timid nature such as Jolly Gliscor, Jolly 176 Speed Jirachi, and Adamant Salamence. Should you choose to take the more powerful choice and try a Modest nature instead, almighty Unown can still outspeed Jolly Gyarados, Timid Heatran, Jolly Breloom and Jolly Cloyster, allowing it to utterly destroy these enemies with the Hidden Power of choice.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are no more options for this set, for Unown runs Hidden Power and only Hidden Power, its pride does not allow it to try other moves. It won't need any other attacks, anyway, as it's the perfect revenge killer and will just need to switch in and deal huge damage to its foe, then run away while a teammate deals with the remnants of the opposition.</p>

<p>This set requires the same teammates and help as The Most Almighty Unown, so you'd better read the additional comments there to see how can you utilize the utmost power of Unown.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can literally run any type of Hidden Power! Unown has an option for every type and its power knows no limits&mdash;other than being hit by any other opposing Pokemon, of course. Unown wouldn't want to learn any other moves anyway, because it does not need them. Hidden Power is all it needs to wreak havoc, cause despair, and spread fear amongst the opposing team. Using stronger moves such as the boring Fire Blast, Hydro Pump, or Draco Meteor would make Unown a little girl who can't fight and likes to risk a miss that could cost you a game. Unown is no gambler.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Literally nothing can counter or check almighty Unown, as it is a force to be reckoned with by all teams. Well, nothing unless you face that rare opposing Pokemon that's either faster, has a damaging move, resists its Hidden Power type, has an existent Special Defense stat, has a priority move, or is just not Unown.</p>
