[Overview]

<p>One of the most threatening sweepers in DPP OU, Lucario has returned to the BW OU battlefield with some new toys. BW increased ExtremeSpeed's priority to +2, which means Mach Punch Infernape, among other such Pokemon, can no longer check it. In addition, the Dream World gave Lucario an ability it can actually make good use of: Justified. With this ability, Lucario gains an Attack boost upon getting hit by any Dark-type attack, which it can easily switch into thanks to its 4x resistance to Dark. Lucario also has a rare 4x resistance to Stealth Rock, which makes it difficult to wear it down with entry hazards. Its Steel typing brings it an immunity to Toxic; it therefore doesn't have to worry about poison damage prematurely ending its sweeps. However, there are many Pokemon capable of beating Lucario, such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr. Lucario also has four moveslot syndrome, which prevents it from covering every single relevant threat. Despite its flaws, however, Lucario is a deadly sweeper that will destroy any team not prepared for it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lucario's flagship set in DPP OU makes a return in BW2, and is arguably even better than it used to be, as ExtremeSpeed lets it take on Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, as well as Technician Breloom. As soon as Lucario sets up a Swords Dance boost, not many Pokemon will be able to take its attacks. Even Skarmory is almost always OHKOed by a +2 Close Combat after Stealth Rock, which is a testament to how powerful a boosted Lucario is. Although its base 90 Speed might seem like a letdown at first, Lucario gets ExtremeSpeed to circumvent that problem and allow it to take on Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-W, as well as priority users such as Breloom.</p>

<p>Lucario's fourth move should depend on what its team most needs covered. If Gliscor and Landorus-T threaten the team, Ice Punch is the preferred option; however, if you need Lucario to handle Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Slowbro, use Crunch instead. If none of these Pokemon concern you, Bullet Punch is a solid option that allows Lucario to get past Gengar, Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lucario should always run as much Attack and Speed as possible. Lucario's defenses are garbage, so investing in them will not get you anywhere. A Jolly nature allows Lucario to outspeed opposing Swords Dance Lucario who opt for an Adamant nature. In addition to this, Jolly Lucario also outspeeds neutral-natured Celebi, Gliscor, Hydreigon, and Jirachi, all of which are capable of taking a boosted ExtremeSpeed. However, a Jolly nature is not that useful outside of these threats because most Pokemon who use Speed-boosting natures to outspeed Lucario will get nailed by ExtremeSpeed; the increase in power is generally more useful.</p>

<p>Hi Jump Kick is worth considering over Close Combat due to its ability to deal more damage to certain physical walls, such as Hippowdon and Skarmory. With Hi Jump Kick, Lucario has a decent chance to OHKO Hippowdon at +2 after one layer of Spikes, and will always OHKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock. However, its 90% accuracy makes it less appealing, especially considering Lucario loses 50% of its health if it misses. In addition to this, Pokemon such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Politoed might be seen using Protect, which makes Hi Jump Kick even more risky to use. Using Hi Jump Kick means Lucario no longer suffers from defense drops, but the defense drops due to using Close Combat do not really matter because Lucario isn't surviving any non-resisted hit regardless.</p>

<p>Lucario's ability choice comes down to the user's preference. Justified is generally more useful as this allows it to gain an additional Attack boost upon switching in on Dark-type attacks. In addition, although there are few users of Dark-type attacks in OU, the only common user of flinching moves in OU, Jirachi, cannot reliably beat Justified Lucario. However, Inner Focus is still worth considering because this gives Lucario a better chance against Jirachi.</p>

<p>As Lucario has poor defenses, the best way for it to set up is to use teammates that attract Crunch and Pursuit, such as Latios, Latias, and Gengar. If Lucario isn't using Bullet Punch, enemy Gengar are solid checks that can OHKO Lucario with Focus Blast; Choice Scarf Tyranitar can in turn trap Gengar with Pursuit. Conkeldurr will also prove to be difficult for Lucario to handle, as it can take even +3 ExtremeSpeed and OHKO with Mach Punch. Slowbro is a good teammate to handle Conkeldurr as it can take care of Conkeldurr with STAB Psychic. As Slowbro is also slower than Conkeldurr, Payback will only hit it for a low 50 Base Power. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite, Choice Band Terrakion, and mixed Salamence can wear down physical walls such as Slowbro and Hippowdon, which makes it easier for Lucario to sweep. Spikes support from the likes of Skarmory can also help Lucario muscle through physical tanks, including the aforementioned Slowbro and Hippowdon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With good offensive stats and a good movepool, Lucario has quite a few more options. Stone Edge can be used on the Swords Dance set in order to hit Gyarados, while still hitting Pokemon such as Dragonite hard. As Lucario's Special Attack stat is actually higher than its Attack stat, a Nasty Plot set might seem appealing at first glance. However, too many faster Pokemon—including Alakazam and Starmie—resist Vacuum Wave, so it is not as effective as the Swords Dance set. An Agility set might seem appealing as it can beat typical revenge killers such as Terrakion and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, but it is very weak and Breloom can easily revenge kill it with Mach Punch. Calm Mind boosts Lucario's Special Defense while also raising its Special Attack, but Lucario's frailty makes this a pointless endeavor and Keldeo does Calm Mind better anyway.</p>

<p>Lucario can use Choice sets to decent effect, particularly Choice Specs. However, the likes of Latios, Scizor, and Terrakion do these better. Lucario can make use of an Air Balloon to set up on Pokemon such as Landorus-T Choice-locked into Earthquake, but it will miss the extra damage output from Life Orb, making its damage output noticeably lower against Pokemon such as Skarmory. Lucario has another ability, Steadfast, which boosts its Speed by one stage when it is flinched. However, because flinching moves are almost always paired up with paralysis, Steadfast is not a good choice.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Physically defensive Unaware Quagsire is one of the few physical walls that can take on Lucario and live to tell the tale. It cannot reliably switch in on Close Combat, but thanks to Unaware, it ignores Lucario's stat boosts, and can easily take Close Combat and retaliate with Earthquake. Hippowdon too can sponge +2 Close Combat and OHKO Lucario with Earthquake, but it will be severely weakened afterwards, and will fall to +3 Close Combat. Gliscor is capable of taking anything but Ice Punch, and can also OHKO Lucario with Earthquake; faster variants of Gliscor can check even Ice Punch Lucario. Sableye, although uncommon, can burn Lucario with Prankster Will-O-Wisp before Crunch does massive damage to it, which makes Lucario much easier to deal with.</p>

<p>There are other Pokemon that can check Lucario, depending on which moves it uses. In particular, Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Salamence, Landorus-T, and Gyarados, can come in on Lucario as it uses Swords Dance, take +1 ExtremeSpeed, and OHKO with the appropriate move. However, if Lucario carries Ice Punch, Salamence and Landorus-T must be careful of switching in. Jellicent and Slowbro can both comfortably wall and force out Lucario that lack Crunch, while Reuniclus can OHKO it with Focus Blast. Gengar can check Lucario that lack Bullet Punch and OHKO it with Focus Blast.</p>

<p>If all else fails, revenge killing Lucario is always an option. Celebi and Jirachi only need 176 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral-natured Lucario, and can both take a boosted ExtremeSpeed and OHKO Lucario with a super effective attack. Choice Scarf users such as Heatran, Terrakion, and Tyranitar also outspeed Lucario, and can take it on due to their resistance to ExtremeSpeed, though the latter two must look out for Bullet Punch.</p>
