[Overview]

<p>While Jellicent and Gengar are the premier spinblockers in OU, Cofagrigus is able to set itself apart from the rest due to a few unique qualities it possesses. Its gargantuan Defense stat, access to the ability Mummy, which lets it take abilities away from Pokemon that rely on them such as Conkeldurr, Toxicroak, and Scizor, and low enough Speed to make a decent Trick Room sweeper give it a viable niche in the OU metagame. With flawless coverage coming from only Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting, Cofagrigus has room to run Nasty Plot, enabling it to perform the role of both a spinblocker and a late-game Trick Room sweeper. However, this is Cofagrigus's only niche, and it's a small one at that. It is outclassed in nearly every other role by other Ghost-types like Jellicent and Sableye, which possess better typing and abilities suited for defensive or supportive roles. Additionally, while Cofagrigus does have high base Defense, its HP and Special Defense stats leave much to be desired. This makes it vulnerable to most hard-hitting special attacks, especially in a metagame revolving around rain-boosted Hydro Pumps from the likes of Keldeo and Politoed. Still, Cofagrigus should not be written off, as it can be quite the effective spinblocker and late-game sweeper if played to its strengths.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In a metagame where having Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes on the opponent's side of the field can mean the difference between a win and a loss, Cofagrigus finds itself uniquely qualified to run an offensive Trick Room set that doubles as a spinblocker. It can set up a Trick Room on certain spinners, such as Forretress and Donphan,then boost its Special Attack with Nasty Plot as they switch out. After a single boost, Cofagrigus becomes a formidable force under Trick Room, outspeeding the entire tier and taking advantage of its flawless coverage with its Ghost- and Fighting-type attacks. Shadow Ball is Cofagrigus's STAB move, and hits most spinners the hardest, 2HKOing Tentacruel and OHKOing Starmie and Donphan if Sturdy has been broken at +2. It also hits opposing Ghost-types that might try to switch in on Cofagrigus to take advantage of its low Special Defense, OHKOing Gengar and Chandelure. Hidden Power Fighting rounds off the coverage, and hits the Steel-types that otherwise give Cofagrigus trouble, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress. While Leftovers is the preferred item because it increases the chance Cofagrigus has of setting up, with a Nasty Plot boost and Fighting Gem, Cofagrigus can OHKO the abovePokemon. To better understand why Fighting Gem is a possible item choice, look at these damage calculations:</p>

<ul="damage_calculation">
<li>+2 252+ SpA Fighting Gem Cofagrigus Hidden Power Fighting vs. 252 HP / 252+ SpD Tyranitar in sand: 388-460 (96.03 - 113.86%) -- guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock</li>
<li>+2 252+ SpA Fighting Gem Cofagrigus Hidden Power Fighting vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Terrakion in sand: 294-346 (91.02 - 107.12%) -- 81.25% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock</li>
<li>+2 252+ SpA Fighting Gem Cofagrigus Hidden Power Fighting vs. 224 HP / 32 SpD Skarmory: 258-304 (78.89 - 92.96%) -- 37.5% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock</li>
<li>+2 252+ SpA Fighting Gem Cofagrigus Hidden Power Fighting vs. 252 HP / 208 SpD Ferrothorn: 298-352 (84.65 - 100%) -- 43.75% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock</li>
<li>+2 252+ SpA Fighting Gem Cofagrigus Hidden Power Fighting vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Forretress: 303-357 (85.59 - 100.84%) -- 87.5% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to OHKO all of these Pokemon is certainly appealing, and speaks volumes about the potency of a +2 Fighting Gem-boosted Hidden Power Fighting. However, it should be noted that Leftovers makes it easier for Cofagrigus to set up to +2 under Trick Room in the first place. Finally, while Cofagrigus can work effectively on balanced entry hazard-stacking teams, it can also work very effectively on dedicated Trick Room teams. If other teammates can supply the Trick Room, it can mean that Cofagrigus won't have to take as many hits before setting up a Nasty Plot.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Quiet nature and the IVs listed, Cofagrigus becomes as slow as possible while still maintaining a Base Power of 70 on Hidden Power Fighting. The lowered Attack IVs ensure minimal damage from Foul Play and confusion damage while also keeping Hidden Power asstrong as possible. Life Orb can also be used over either Leftovers or Fighting Gem to consistently boost both of Cofagrigus's attacks. The main draws to use this over Fighting Gem are that Shadow Ball will be the move it uses most often, and it is a consistent boost over the one-time use of Fighting Gem. However, as stated before, Cofagrigus needs to take a few hits to set up, and adding Life Orb recoil on top of that means it will be worn down rather quickly.</p>

<p>Cofagrigus needs entry hazard support in order to be effective, as its role as both a sweeper and spinblocker are contingent on entry hazards being present on the opponent's side of the field. Not only does it block the opponent from spinning away those entry hazards, but it also appreciates opposing Pokemon being weakened when it tries to sweep. In particular, Ferrothorn makes a good partner for Cofagrigus, as they cover each other's weaknesses in rain, and Cofagrigus loves switching in on Choice-locked Close Combats and Secret Swordswhile Ferrothorn can absorb powerful special attacks aimed at Cofagrigus such as Draco Meteor from Latios or Hydro Pump from Keldeo. Despite using Fighting Gem and Hidden Power Fighting, Cofagrigus appreciates having Steel-types eliminated, as Fighting Gem is a one-time-use item, meaning that multiple Steel-types on one team can be problematic. As such, powerful Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeomake excellent partners. Not only do they help eliminate Steel-types, but they also can wallbreak in general, making it all the easier for Cofagrigus to sweep late-game. Magnezone also makes a good partner, as it can trap Steel-types and works especially well in Trick Room due to its own low Speed. All-out attacker Conkeldurr is a wonderful partner for Cofagrigus, as it loves the Trick Room support that Cofagrigus can provide. It also lures and KOes common threats to Cofagrigus such as Skarmory, and can wallbreak in general with its amazing coverage and power. As mentioned above, Cofagrigus can make an excellent addition to any full Trick Room team as a spinblocker. Pokemon such as Bronzong, Reuniclus, and Porygon2 that can set up Trick Room for Cofagrigus all make excellent partners, as having Trick Room already active means that Cofagrigus only needs to take up one turn to set up as opposed to two.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cofagrigus can use a defensive set that makes use of its wide support movepool that includes moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, Curse, Destiny Bond, and Haze. However, the support and defensive roles are largely outclassed by Sableye and Jellicent, respectively. A Calm Mind set with Calm Mind / Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Fighting / Pain Split and an EV spread maximizing Defense also looks appealing, as it allows Cofagrigus to boost its lackluster Special Defense. Unfortunately, in a tier with Jirachi, Latias, and Reuniclus, Calm Mind Cofagrigus is simply outclassed. It also doesn't hit as hard as the offensive Trick Room set and takes much longer to set up, which isn't usually possible in such a fast-paced, offensive metagame. Finally, a Choice Specs set can be used, but once again, Jellicent outclasses it in this role due to having a better offensive movepool and typing.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Cofagrigus needs two turns to set up before it becomes a legitimate threat, so taking it out in those two turns is the best way of dealing with it. Cofagrigus has low HP and Special Defense, so hard-hitting special attackers are often safe bets for dealing with it. Keldeo is not weak to Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Fightingand can OHKO Cofagrigus with either a Choice Scarf Hydro Pump in the rainor a Choice Specs Hydro Pump outside of it. Heatran, Latios, Gengar, and Hydreigon can all hit Cofagrigus for major damage with their STAB moves, but they have to worry about it setting up Trick Room on the switch, as they are all weak to its attacking moves; however, Heatran and Hydreigon can survive a Hidden Power Fighting as long as Cofagrigus hasn't set up a Nasty Plot. Choice Band Tyranitar can tank a non-boosted Hidden Power Fighting and OHKO Cofagrigus with Crunch. Politoed can survive one +2 Shadow Ball and OHKO with a Choice Specs Hydro Pump. Calm Mind Meloetta can reliably set up on Cofagrigus, taking very little from Hidden Power Fighting, and can eventually KO it with a boosted Psychic. Blissey and Chansey can Toxic stall Cofagrigus and take close to nothing from even a +2 Hidden Power Fighting. Specially defensive Skarmory and Hippowdon can both tank a boosted hit and Whirlwind Cofagrigus away; because it takes Cofagrigus two turns to set up, it may not be able to do so twice in once match, so this can effectively cripple it. However, neither of these Pokemon can beat it one-on-one.</p>
