[Overview]

<p>Gurdurr has good physical bulk, with base stats of 85 in Defense and HP. It also resists Stealth Rock, allowing it to easily enter the field. Although Gurdurr's Special Defense is lacking, with the new Eviolite item its Special Defense can actually reach a maximum of 327. However, with the many offensive Psychic-type Pokemon in the tier such as Azelf, Gurdurr still has a hard time. It also has a low Speed stat, like most bulky Pokemon, but this is somewhat remedied by Mach Punch, and the lack of Leftovers is covered by Drain Punch. Bulk Up also makes sure that Gurdurr will hit hard with its great base Attack stat of 105, while boosting its already high Defense stat. At the same time, Gurdurr has the ability Guts, making it even more impressive defensively and offensively, as the opponent will be wary of inflicting it with status. Overall, Gurdurr is a dangerous offensive and defensive threat, and it shouldn't be underestimated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Gurdurr's best set and the only set it should ever use. Bulk Up boosts Gurdurr's already high Attack and Defense stats to even higher levels. Drain Punch allows Gurdurr to dish out damage and make up for the lack of Leftovers and any other form of recovery outside of Rest. Payback takes care of Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist Gurdurr's Fighting-type moves. Mach Punch gives Gurdurr a welcomed priority move, and can really help take on faster and frailer opponents. Alternatively, Rest gives Gurdurr instant recovery and cures it from any status it may have, as when Gurdurr is setting up with Bulk Up, it will be worn down fast despite its bulk. Hammer Arm can be used over Drain Punch if you opt to use Rest.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stone Edge is an option to hit Flying-type Pokemon, such as Zapdos and Togekiss, harder. A Careful nature with 252 HP EVs and 252 SpD EVs is used to maximize Gurdurr's special bulk, with the rest put into Defense. With these EVs and Eviolite, Gurdurr reaches defensive stats of 374 HP, 311 Defense, 327 Special Defense, and an Attack stat of 246. Even with one or two Bulk Ups, Gurdurr will hit hard. An alternate EV spread 252 HP / 108 Atk / 148 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used to give Gurdurr a more offensive approach. With these EVs, Gurdurr will have these stats: 374 HP, 300 Attack, 309 Defense, and 260 SpD.</p>

<p>Entry hazards help in taking down the opponent's Pokemon. Drapion is immune to Psychic-type moves, and can set up Toxic Spikes. Light Screen can help Gurdurr take special moves easier. Uxie is a good teammate, as it resists Psychic-type moves, and can set up Light Screen and Stealth Rock.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gurdurr has a lot of Fighting-type moves that it can use, but Drain Punch, Mach Punch, and Hammer Arm are its best options; however, Brick Break, Low Sweep, and Superpower might come in handy. Focus Punch can be used in combination with Substitute. Gurdurr also has access to DynamicPunch, but can't use it successfully, as it doesn't have No Guard like Machamp has. Toxic can help take down some Pokemon easier, while Taunt shuts down Pokemon that might want to set up on you. Poison Jab hits Tangrowth harder than Gurdurr's other moves.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Against Gurdurr, Tangrowth can do whatever he pleases with Leech Seed, but lacks any hard hitting move to outright KO Gurdurr. It does, however, have access to Sleep Powder to put Gurdurr out of commission. If Gurdurr lacks Stone Edge, a physically defensive Zapdos will take little damage from its attacks, and Zapdos can also use Roar to force Gurdurr to switch out. Togekiss and Yanmega hit hard with Air Slash. Yanmega resists Gurdurr's Fighting-type moves, and Togekiss can paralyze Gurdurr and make it flinch until it's KOed. However, Togekiss needs to be careful of Guts, and both of them need to watch out for Stone Edge. Slowbro takes little damage from Gurdurr's attacks thanks to its high Defense stat, and can threaten Gurdurr with Psychic. Pokemon that have access to Roar or Dragon Tail, and Pokemon that have access to Haze, such as Suicune and Milotic, can stop Gurdurr's attempts to set up. Also, Knock Off users make Gurdurr practically useless defensively, and any hard hitting special move will KO it.</p>
