[Overview]

<p>Mamoswine is, without question, one of the most awesome offensive forces of the UU metagame. Rotom-H, Rotom-F, Cryogonal, and Shedinja are the only Pokemon in UU that resist its STAB combination. With base 130 Attack, it has the fourth strongest Earthquake and the strongest physical Ice-type attack in the entire game! Ice and Ground are two of the best offensive types and, when combined together on a powerhouse like Mamoswine in the unprepared UU metagame, heads will roll (or be stomped in). There is nothing in the entire metagame that wants to switch into a Mamoswine.</p>

<p>In addition to its raw power, Mamoswine possesses reasonable defensive stats and Speed. It also lacks a Stealth Rock weakness and is immune to Thunder Wave. It possesses all the survivability it needs to fulfill its roles as a wallbreaker or sweeper. It even covers its Speed problems with the strongest Ice Shard in the game. Mamoswine's only real weakness is a lack of usable resistances, bringing nothing but an Electric immunity and a Poison resistance to its team. This, unfortunately, makes it very difficult to switch Mamoswine into attacks, and starves the team of much needed resistances in a very offensive metagame. That said, Mamoswine will wreak havoc each time it does make it to the field, and will surely be a tremendous asset in plowing out a win for its teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Mamoswine's bread and butter, maximizing the incredible force of Mamoswine's raw offensive power. Ice- and Ground-type attacks form an incredible STAB combo that is extremely difficult to defend against in UU. With Mamoswine's awesome base 130 Attack and STAB compounded to this attacking combination, most teams will be hard-pressed to deal with Mamoswine using even the sturdiest walls. Switching into this beast is a nightmare, and even revenge killing with a faster Pokemon is a dangerous prospect thanks to Mamoswine's impressive Ice Shard.</p>

<p>Choice Band maximizes Mamoswine's power and doesn't drain its HP, but Mamoswine is so short on switch-in opportunities that it will generally not want to lock itself into a move. Being able to freely switch between STAB moves and mix in Ice Shard lets Mamoswine really threaten a sweep in addition to wallbreaking and revenge killing.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because of the terrific coverage provided by just its STAB attacks, there is some flexibility in choosing Mamoswine's fourth move. For the most part, covering Rotom-H and Rotom-F with Stone Edge is the most favorable, as these are foes you will encounter with some frequency in the UU metagame. Even their bulkiest sets will be decimated by Mamoswine's Stone Edge, especially if they are forced to take super effective Stealth Rock damage beforehand. Generally speaking though, there are few other foes you would need Stone Edge's coverage to beat. Return is another option to get some generally useful neutral coverage, but it would probably only be used over Stone Edge by players who really hate Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Bulldoze is an interesting option to finish off weakened foes who are hit by Ground-type attacks, but should only be used on the Life Orb set. Should the opponent try to save their Pokemon by switching to a Grass- or Bug-type such as Shaymin or Heracross, Bulldoze will knock down their Speed, and possibly give Mamoswine an opportunity to finish them off with Icicle Crash.</p>

<p>Other alternative moves to use with Life Orb include Substitute, Toxic, and Stealth Rock. Substitute is generally useful on offensive Pokemon who can find room for it, and can be really effective with the number of switches Mamoswine forces. Be careful though, as Life Orb and Substitute used in tandem will quickly drain Mamoswine's health. Using Leftovers is possible, but Mamoswine really wants its item to boost its power. Toxic is a nasty surprise for bulky Water-types who switch into Mamoswine, and is definitely worthy of consideration. Stealth Rock is always good to have, and while Mamoswine will usually prefer to attack on the rare chances it has to come in, it is not a bad option for teams that can't find another teammate to set it up. Icicle Spear is another interesting STAB option that can be used to break Substitutes and hit unprepared foes. Mamoswine also has some great tutor moves from previous generations, including Superpower and Knock Off, but these are incompatible with Icicle Crash—you would be forced to rely on Icicle Spear to use them. These options are only recommended on Mamoswine teams that really hate Chansey, as Chansey can and will beat Life Orb Mamoswine without Superpower or Knock Off.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the best teammates for Mamoswine will be other offensive Pokemon, who are capable of taking advantage of the holes Mamoswine opens in the enemy team, or return the favor by weakening the foes for a Mamoswine sweep. Mamoswine's lack of resistances means it can't offer much by the way of defensive synergy with other Pokemon, but the ability to jointly overwhelm the foe will make it a great partner for most super offensive teammates. Where possible, try to use Water- or Flying-types that can lure in Electric-type moves for Mamoswine to switch in against. Also keep in mind that Mamoswine really appreciates Stealth Rock support when dealing with enemy teams that have Rotom-H or Rotom-F. Some impressive offensive Pokemon that can also set up Stealth Rock reliably include Mew and Rhyperior. In terms of applying offensive pressure with Mamoswine, Rhyperior is unparalleled, but their common weaknesses can be hard for their teammates to deal with.</p>

<p>Aside from offensive teammates, there are many Pokemon that can provide Mamoswine with great support. Mamoswine is definitely a reasonable Baton Pass target thanks to its fair defenses, Speed and immunity to Thunder Wave, with Gorebyss as the ideal Baton Pass user. After it is passed a Shell Break, Life Orb Mamoswine will crush anything that stands in its way. Abomasnow is also a Pokemon to consider, or rather Mamoswine is definitely a Pokemon to consider for your hail team. Finally, Slowbro and Slowking resist Fire-, Fighting-, and Water-type attacks, and are generally good Pokemon for any team thanks to their bulk and endurance with Regenerator.</p>

[SET]
name: Endeavor Lead
move 1: Ice Shard
move 2: Endeavor
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stealth Rock
item: Focus Sash
ability: Snow Cloak
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As far as gimmicks go, this is a pretty good one, and has always had solid performance since its use in DPP. Hail and sand immunities make breaking Mamoswine's Focus Sash in the lead match up tricky, especially since relatively few Pokemon carry Fake Out in BW, with Technician Hitmontop being the only top UU Pokemon to commonly use it. Relying on Focus Sash, Mamoswine can use Stealth Rock in relative safety. In the ideal situation, it would get knocked down to its Focus Sash and have the opportunity to bring down a foe or two with Endeavor and Ice Shard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Depending on the situation, Mamoswine may choose to use Endeavor and Ice Shard from the start for a very reliable kill on a faster opponent at the price of setting up Stealth Rock. Jolly is an option to set up Stealth Rock with a bit more reliability by maximizing Mamoswine's Speed. Neither the boost to its Speed nor its Attack is of particular importance for this set, so it is almost a matter of splitting hairs. Set up Stealth Rock, and mess around with the opponent using Endeavor; that's the bottom line.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Icicle Crash
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge / Icicle Spear
move 4: Toxic / Stealth Rock
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Snow Cloak
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Scarf definitely seems like a strange option on Mamoswine—or any Pokemon with access to priority—but Mamoswine's reasonable speed and immense power definitely lets Choice Scarf warrant consideration. The ability to get ahead of foes and smash them with Earthquake is a huge boon, and even Icicle Crash is decisively more powerful than a Life Orb Ice Shard. Mamoswine's immunity to sand, hail, and Thunder Wave eases its role as a Choice Scarf user. Unfortunately, its lack of resistances does plague it on this set, giving it few opportunities to switch in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Aside from Earthquake and Icicle Crash, Mamoswine has quite a bit of freedom in choosing its last two moves. Stone Edge is favored to complete its coverage and beat Rotom-H and Rotom-F. Icicle Spear is an option to revenge kill opponents behind substitutes for teams that bring alternative methods for beating the Rotom formes. Toxic makes a return as a nasty surprise for bulky Water-type switch-ins, while Stealth Rock is a filler move for teams that cannot find room for a different Stealth Rock user. It should be noted that Choice Scarf Mamoswine outspeeds all common Taunt users (though Jolly is needed to beat Crobat). Adamant is Mamoswine's preferred nature, easily outpacing everything up to Weavile and Swellow. Jolly is only needed to outrun 130 base Speed foes, as well as Adamant Choice Scarf Heracross and Modest Rotom-A. One should keep in mind that Ice Shard is always a possible option, even on the Choice Scarf set. Its primary function would be to finish off other Choice Scarf users, most notably Flygon.</p>

<p>One would do well to keep in mind that this Mamoswine is easily used as setup bait for a number of Pokemon once it has locked itself into an attack. One would do well to support this Pokemon with teammates that can remove the effects of enemy set-up moves. Phazers are the primary candidates, with Pokemon such as Milotic, Suicune, and Roar Arcanine being particularly noteworthy. Pokemon that can use Rapid Spin and Brick Break could also come in handy if you can find room.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you are using a hail-based team, Substitute and Leftovers can be used to abuse Snow Cloak and frustrate your opponent. Mamoswine is intimidating, but a Mamoswine behind a Substitute is simply terrifying. Keep in mind though that Mamoswine will sorely miss the power boost, and will find itself doing embarrassing damage to foes such as Slowbro, Deoxys-D, and even Chansey. Curse is Mamoswine's only option for boosting its Attack outside of using Life Orb or Choice Band, but Mamoswine generally lacks the defensive prowess to effectively use it.</p>

<p>Superpower and Knock Off have been mentioned as some extremely useful moves Mamoswine received from tutors in earlier generations. Knock Off is especially useful with the popularity of Eviolite in UU, especially on Chansey. While the pink blob can often overcome Life Orb-boosted Earthquakes, it will find itself trampled under toe without its precious Eviolite.</p>

<p>Mamoswine also gets some other great support moves, including Reflect, Light Screen, and Roar. While these are very useful moves, Mamoswine lacks the resistances and raw defensive stats to fulfill a support role dependably.</p>

<p>Mamoswine's Dream World ability, Thick Fat, is released. With a lack of resistances being its biggest weakness, one would expect this ability to be a great boon to Mamoswine. It certainly would be if the ability were compatible with Mamoswine's key moves. As of now, Dream World Mamoswine is awful, since it cannot use any Egg moves or previous generation moves, meaning no Icicle Crash, Superpower, Knock Off, or Stealth Rock. However, if a female Mamoswine or Swinub were to be released in the Dream World, this situation would change, as it would make Thick Fat compatible with Mamoswine's Egg moves. Dream World Mamoswine with access to both Icicle Crash and Stealth Rock would be very good for teams that do not use hail.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mamoswine has no true counters. By virtue of its ridiculous power and coverage, almost nothing in UU really wants to switch into a Mamoswine. Slowbro and Intimidate Hitmontop with maximum bulk are probably the most dependable checks, but even they will not want to switch into repeated Earthquakes. Slowbro can play mind games with Flying-type or Levitating teammates in conjunction with Regenerator to gain the advantage. Pokemon such as Uxie and Cresselia can switch into Mamoswine with relative safely, but due to their pathetic offensive abilities and Mamoswine's immunity to Thunder Wave, there's not a whole lot they can do to Mamoswine. It should be noted that Rotom-H and Rotom-F will counter Mamoswine outright should it lack Stone Edge. If it does have Stone Edge, they must be wary, especially if Stealth Rock is on the field.</p>

<p>There are many Pokemon that can check Mamoswine with a bit of prediction. UU has many Fire-types with decent bulk that also outspeed Mamoswine and can easily OHKO it. Victini, Rotom-H and Arcanine are the best examples; just don't switch Victini or Arcanine into Earthquake. Cobalion is in a similar boat. Grass-types such as Shaymin also have the speed and power to eliminate Mamoswine, and possess the bulk to handle an Ice Shard or two. Just make sure you don't switch them directly into Icicle Crash. Tangrowth is a decent check, having massive physical bulk and Regenerator to heal itself once it has brought Mamoswine down. However, it too doesn't want to switch directly into Icicle Crash. Regenerator helps ease your prediction problems since it lets you mess up once or twice without losing Tangrowth. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune can switch into Mamoswine and threaten it, but will want to avoid repeatedly switching into Earthquake.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, switching into Mamoswine is a nightmare, but revenge killing it is very easy. Its base 80 Speed is decidedly mediocre, and it lacks the defensive stats and resistances to hold up against the majority of UU's offensive threats. Just be sure you do not pick something that can be killed by Ice Shard. It's noteworthy to mention that Mamoswine is hard to switch into, but it also has a terrible chance of switching onto the field itself because of its weaknesses to some of the most common types in the game. Play your cards right and you might be able to avoid the situation where you have to "counter" Mamoswine altogether.</p>
