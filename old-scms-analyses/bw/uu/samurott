[Overview]

<p>With BW comes Samurott, another Water-type with decent defenses and above average offensive stats. As in previous generations, Water is a good type to have due to its amazing neutral coverage and few weaknesses. In addition to its impressive offensive stats, it gets Swords Dance to help boost its Attack to high levels. Samurott's movepool is fairly shallow, but includes some interesting support options such as Encore and Taunt. Furthermore, access to priority in the form of STAB Aqua Jet sets it apart from its bulky Water-type brethren such as Suicune or Milotic, and helps Samurott work around its mediocre Speed. Unfortunately, Feraligatr also sports an impressive Attack stat and Aqua Jet, and would leave Samurott outclassed, if not for an important, key move: Megahorn. Megahorn is a boon to Samurott, crushing the plethora of bulky Grass- and Psychic-types littering the UU metagame. Being able to crush them with its coverage attack is an invaluable skill that sets Samurott apart from Feraligatr.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set capitalizes on Samurott's unique and well-balanced movepool. With priority in the form of Aqua Jet, Samurott can check frail, faster threats. After a Swords Dance boost, Samurott using Megahorn with Life Orb OHKOes Slowbro and has a 66.66% chance to OHKO the most defensive Tangrowth, toppling two foes that stand as complete stops to the majority of UU's physical sweepers. It also OHKOes defensive variants of Mew, whom Feraligatr fails to OHKO with Swords Dance-boosted Crunch or Ice Punch. After a Swords Dance, Samurott with full Attack investment reaches an Attack stat of 656, which really hurts when equipped with a Life Orb. The HP EVs reach a Leftovers number as well as a Life Orb number, and the Speed EVs allow Samurott to outspeed Milotic, almost all Hitmontop, and Honchkrow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>In the last moveslot, you can use Encore or Taunt to help with setup—specifically, to stop walls from healing or using status moves against Samurott—though if you predict a healing move, it might be wise to simply use Swords Dance again. If Ghost-types pose a significant threat, you can use Night Slash instead of Megahorn although Samurott loses out on its main selling point—the ability to OHKO Tangrowth and Slowbro after a boost. Night Slash's only significant advantage is taking down the very rare Frillish. Without a Swords Dance under its belt, Samurott lacks the raw power to destroy opponents, so getting up a Swords Dance is crucial to this set’s success.</p>

<p>Maximum HP helps Samurott survive for more time with it's passable defenses, and Leftovers can bolster this further at the cost of Life Orb's significant power boost. Also, an alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to allow Samurott to outspeed more threats. More specifically, Samurott can run 124 EVs in Speed to outrun Suicune or 84 EVs to outrun neutral base 80 Speed Pokemon that don't invest in the stat. Samurott can use Toxic to cripple its would-be counters (though Empoleon walls it regardless), but it is not necessary, due to the power of Megahorn and Waterfall after a boost.</p>

<p>Samurott appreciates teammates that resist its Grass- and Electric-type weaknesses. Registeel and Nidoqueen in particular are useful teammates that can switch into these types of attacks and set up entry hazards. They also give Samurott switch-in opportunities by luring in attacks it tanks with its Fire- and Ice-type resistances. Fire-types are also useful teammates, as they resist Samurott's Grass-type weakness, and absorb incoming Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Return can be used over Waterfall or Aqua Jet, offering greater neutral coverage at the expense of either power or priority. A special set is also viable as Samurott has access to Grass Knot, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power for coverage. Choice sets are somewhat outclassed by the Swords Dance set due to the latter's greater power, and speed issues mitigated by Aqua Jet's priority. A support set with Encore and Taunt could work, as bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune do not have access to those moves, but is generally ineffective.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Countering Samurott is not too difficult because of its low Speed and imperfect coverage. Registeel is generally a great counter to Samurott, as it can switch in relatively easily with its naturally high Defense and cripple Samurott with Toxic. Ghost-types with access to Will-O-Wisp can burn Samurott and render it useless for the rest of the match. Empoleon is probably the best Samurott counter, due to its resistance to Bug- and Water-type moves and the ability to burn Samurott with Scald. Furthermore, Poliwrath and Qwilfish also resist the Water- and Bug-type attack combination and easily handle the Swords Dance sets. Poliwrath will simply attack and phaze Samurott with Circle Throw, while Qwilfish will cut Samurott's attack with Intimidate, set up Spikes, and cut away any attempt Samurott makes to set up and sweep with Haze. Altaria, while relatively uncommon, resists Bug- and Water-type moves, but is unable to take repeated boosted Waterfalls. It can stop Samurott's sweep with Toxic or Perish Song, or it can simply Draco Meteor to destroy Samurott's weaker Special Defense. Unfortunately, Samurott's defenses aren't the best, and strong, STAB Electric- and Grass-type moves can easily OHKO. In addition, entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes can prematurely end its sweep.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Samurott gets the ability Shell Armor from the Dream World, which is fairly useless, as it only prevents critical hits. It has some possible use on a support set, but Torrent is going to be the best option regardless.</p>
