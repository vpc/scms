[Overview]

<p>Do not be fooled by Uxie's miniature size: 75 / 130 / 130 defenses make the tiny pixie incredibly sturdy. In addition, Uxie is quite fast for a wall, which can be useful in certain scenarios. Uxie's plethora of support moves, such as Yawn, Thunder Wave, the infamous dual screen + Memento combination, Trick, Rain Dance, and Trick Room also makes it a great supportive Pokemon for your team. However, Uxie faces stiff competition for this role with its fellow Psychic-type brethren, particularly Cresselia, because the pixie lacks a reliable means of recovery. This also hinders Uxie's walling capacity since it cannot take on repeated blows. Those that are super effective are especially troubling, and with its pitiful Special Attack, Uxie cannot do much in return, making it very vulnerable to Taunt. Nevertheless, Uxie is an interesting Pokemon who is always full of tricks and surprises.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Like most of its Psychic-type cousins, Uxie can set up both Reflect and Light Screen, a tactic commonly referred to as "dual screening". However, Uxie's immense bulk and movepool, including its ace in the hole, Memento, sets it apart from its fellow dual screen users. In conjunction with both Light Screen and Reflect, Memento's ability to harshly lower the foe's offensive stats nearly guarantees that a frail sweeper will survive even the strongest of attacks, and since Uxie sacrifices itself in the process, said sweeper can be safely brought into the field. Memento is also a great emergency option to get a frail Pokemon in if Uxie does not have enough time to set up both screens. However, in some cases it may be the best to keep Uxie alive for as long as possible, such as against stall teams, since Memento is useless against most walls and defensive Pokemon. Therefore, U-turn is viable as an alternate option. Yawn is listed in the last moveslot to give Uxie and its teammates an easier time setting up. However, this would leave Uxie vulnerable to Pokemon who can Taunt it, so Psychic is a good alternative to prevent the pixie from becoming Taunt bait.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread here is quite simple: maximum HP and Defense allow Uxie to sponge attacks with ease, especially behind screens. However, feel free to alter this spread to make Uxie take on special attackers better. In addition, one may wish to take advantage of Uxie's Speed by using a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature. With Uxie's natural bulk and dual screens, it can afford to move EVs from Defense to Speed. If, for whatever reason, the moves listed in the fourth moveslot are unappealing, Uxie can run Heal Bell to aid its teammates, or Thunder Wave to further cripple enemy offensive teams.</p>

<p>When choosing Uxie as a dual screens user, it is important to know that it faces stiff competition from other Pokemon, most notably Azelf, who boasts a higher Speed stat, offensive stats, and a better offensive movepool; and Cresselia, who has more bulk and access to recovery moves. Uxie's advantages over these two Pokemon is that it has a plethora of support moves to choose from, most notably Heal Bell, and is bulky yet fast, making it a speedy wall. Keep these factors in mind when choosing a dual screens supporter for your team.</p>

<p>Dual screen Uxie is best appreciated by offensive teams, particularly those that rely on heavy offense. As such, it would be best to pair Uxie up with frail sweepers. Houndoom, for example, will almost certainly have an easier time setting up behind Reflect and Light Screen, and can switch into any Dark-type attacks that hurt Uxie. SmashPassers such as Smeargle and Gorebyss will also appreciate dual screens, because Shell Smash will lower their already below-average defensive stats if they do not use White Herb. This also allows the SmashPassers to forgo White Herb with another item.</p>

<p>Although Uxie can be a monster to take down if both screens are set up, Pokemon who can Taunt it, such as Crobat and Aerodactyl, will almost always shut it down. Opposing Pokemon can also set up on Uxie while it is busy setting up dual screens. Smeargle, for example, can Spore Uxie and proceed to set up. One way to prevent this is to pair Uxie up with Magic Bounce Xatu, although having two Psychic-type Pokemon on the same team may leave some large weaknesses to Ghost- and Dark-type moves.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Psychic / Heal Bell / Yawn
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Uxie's large movepool enables it to assist its teammates in a variety of ways, such as laying hazards, crippling the opponent's team with status moves, and acting as a reliable pivot. Uxie should be brought in against a Pokemon that cannot deal to much damage to it. From there, it should cause as much chaos as possible. Stealth Rock is a very notable move for this set because it is no longer a TM move, causing compatibility issues with many BW Pokemon. Fortunately, Uxie is saved from this dilemma, and should lay down the entry hazard as early as possible. After that, Uxie can use U-turn to scout the enemy team and scoot away to an appropriate match-up, or cripple the foe with Thunder Wave. Although not listed on the set, Uxie can use Toxic instead of Thunder Wave to take care of any defensive walls that may trouble it. Psychic gives Uxie an attacking option and is its best bet against any Crobat that may try to Taunt it. However, Psychic may not be too appealing with Uxie's uninvested base 75 Special Attack stat, so you may want to choose Heal Bell instead to rid Uxie's teammates of nasty status conditions. Yawn is also an option for the third moveslot, phazing out a troublesome Pokemon and racking up entry hazard damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum HP and Defense allows Uxie to absorb blows and live long enough to support its teammates. Frail Spikes users such as Roserade, Smeargle, Froslass, and Scolipede will thus appreciate having Uxie as a teammate. Another viable move option which Uxie can use is Magic Coat. Magic Coat will instantly relieve Uxie's fear of being Taunted or set up upon by bouncing those moves right back at them, although it requires some prediction.</p>

<p>Since Support Uxie can fit on almost any team, there are no specific teammates that it needs. Uxie will also rack up entry hazard damage fairly quickly, so a Rapid Spinner helps. Hitmontop has good synergy with Uxie, since it resists Uxie's weakness to Bug and Dark-type attacks, and the pixie resists Hitmontop's Psychic-type weakness. Uxie cannot do much to opposing walls and defensive Pokemon, so teammates that can demolish them are a godsend to Uxie. One way to do this is by having Pokemon who can lay down Toxic Spikes—Scolipede, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Roserade excel at this. As a bonus, Uxie can easily take on any Psychic-type attacks aimed at them. Pokemon who can use Taunt to shut down opposing walls, such as Houndoom and Crobat, also make good partners. Another way to destroy opposing bulky Pokemon is by having hard-hitters such as Heracross and Choice Band Escavalier on Uxie's team. These Pokemon will appreciate Uxie's Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave support.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Psychic / Psyshock
move 4: Thunderbolt
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 96 HP / 188 SpA / 224 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Uxie is quite fast for a defensive Pokemon; by utilizing both Substitute and Calm Mind, along with its great defensive stats, it can surprise and overcome some of its usually more troublesome opponents. Although one might immediately compare Uxie to Mew, who has overall better bulk, slightly better Speed, as well as better offenses, it lacks the Ground-type immunity Uxie sports, making Mew vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Calm Mind boosts Uxie's already great Special Defense, and raises its Special Attack to threatening levels. Substitute blocks dangerous status such as paralysis and Toxic poison, and after a few Calm Mind boosts, Uxie's Substitutes are sturdy enough to withstand most special attacks, even some super effective ones. Psychic is Uxie's most powerful attack, and can destroy anything that does not resist it after a few boosts. Thanks to Uxie's immense bulk, it isn't too difficult to accumulate many boosts. Thunderbolt complements Psychic nicely, landing neutral hits on most things that either resist or are immune to Psychic, with the exception of Krookodile and Steelix, both of which are relatively uncommon in the UU metagame. Psyshock is a viable alternative over Psychic in order to do more damage to special walls, but its lower Base Power makes it less appealing.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread along with a Timid nature allows Uxie to outspeed Rotom, which is arguably the most important thing Uxie needs to outrun, and provides a little more bulk with the 96 HP EVs; the remaining EVs are put into Special Attack in order to ensure that Uxie isn't completely useless without any boosts. An alternate EV spread that maximizes HP and Defense along with a Bold nature can be used in order to take hits better while setting up, but the loss of power and Speed is extremely noticeable. Leftovers should be the only option for this set, as Uxie has no other form of recovery, and appreciates any replenished health, no matter how little. Giga Drain is an option over Thunderbolt in order to hit Krookodile and provide a form of pseudo-healing, but its low Base Power and inferior coverage usually isn't worth it.</p>

<p>As this set aims to attempt a sweep rather than to support the rest of the team, Uxie actually needs assistance from the team in order to be successful. Teammates that are able to set up entry hazards, the most useful being Toxic Spikes as it can wear down the opponent while Uxie sets up, are extremely useful. Qwilfish is an excellent teammate, as it can set up both Toxic Spikes and Spikes, as well as having the ability Intimidate, and access to useful support moves such as Taunt, Thunder Wave, and Haze. Teammates that can get rid of Krookodile and other Dark-types in general are needed, as the latter are immune to Psychic. Bulky Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Machamp, Cobalion, and Hariyama fit the bill nicely.</p>

[SET]
name: Field Supporter
move 1: Rain Dance / Sunny Day / Trick Room
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Psychic / Heal Bell
item: Damp Rock / Heat Rock / Leftovers
nature: Bold / Relaxed
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Field effects such as rain, sun, and Trick Room can be quite devastating if used properly. However, there are currently no Pokemon in UU who can permanently set them up, so teams that rely on these effects require Pokemon who can manually use the move and quickly switch out to an appropriate sweeper. Uxie's movepool, access to U-turn, sheer bulk, and Speed—even when uninvested—therefore makes it a great candidate to set up these moves. Stealth Rock is a major boon towards Uxie's teammates, as it helps them to net vital OHKOs and 2HKOs, which is important considering that they have a limited amount of time before the appropriate field effect disappears. Psychic gives Uxie an attacking option and prevents it from becoming complete Taunt bait. Heal Bell is a viable alternate option, as it further aids teammates by ridding them of status, most notably Toxic, which, when combined with potential entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil, can wear down sweepers fairly quickly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If Uxie is setting up either rain or sun, then Damp Rock or Heat Rock is a given, as it increases the duration of the respective field effects. Trick Room has no such item, so Uxie should opt to use Leftovers instead. In addition, on a Trick Room team, Uxie should use a Relaxed nature instead of a Bold nature and have 0 IVs in Speed. The EVs are, once again, quite simple, and allow Uxie to live long enough to set up the appropriate field effect several times throughout the match.</p>

<p>It is best to have at least one or two other Pokemon on Uxie's team that can set up the same field condition, so your sweepers do not find themselves on limited time. For rain teams, Registeel is a good rain dancer since it loves having its Fire-type weakness reduced. Empoleon is another good dancer, and as a bonus, gains double-STAB on Water-type attacks due to its typing. Cresselia and Arcanine are good Pokemon to set up Sunny Day since they can now recover more health with Moonlight and Morning Sun. As for Trick Room, some good options would be Dusclops, Slowbro, and Cresselia. However, these Pokemon share similar weaknesses with Uxie, so be sure to keep this fact in mind while constructing a Trick Room team. In addition to these Pokemon, Uxie should also be paired up with appropriate sweepers. Rain teams can opt to go with Kingdra, Gorebyss, Kabutops, Ludicolo, and Omastar. Sun teams love to have Sawsbuck, Shaymin, Tangrowth, and Charizard. Common sweepers on Trick Room teams include Escavalier, Rhyperior, Aggron, Slowbro, and Golurk. One important factor to keep in mind is that these Pokemon only have a set amount of turns to sweep, so stall teams and defensive Pokemon may be troublesome. However, rain and sun teams should not have too much of a problem since many of their sweepers gain double STAB on moves, and Trick Room team sweepers often have monstrous strength.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Uxie has a few more options that it can use. One fun set to use is a TrickScarf set. Defensive Pokemon love to switch into and set up on Uxie, but Tricking a Choice Scarf onto them will teach them a lesson. An offensive Calm Mind set may work, but Uxie will have stiff competition with its fellow Psychic-types such as Slowbro, who have access to recovery. As for alternate moves, Knock Off is fun to use on a unsuspecting Dusclops, but does not have much use outside of that. Uxie can opt to run Toxic in place of Yawn, but without a reliable means of recovery, it should not attempt to take down stall teams in the first place.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Uxie absolutely hates Taunt, especially if they are from a faster Pokemon, such as Crobat, Cobalion, Ambipom, Houndoom, and Aerodactyl. Crobat will have to watch out for Psychic, though. Pokemon who can set up a Substitute before Uxie can attack or inflict a status condition will generally have the upper hand. One example is Mismagius, who is a lot faster than Uxie, can set up a Substitute, and proceed to use Nasty Plot. Another example would be Zapdos, who can stall Uxie with a combination of Substitute, Roost, Toxic, and its Pressure ability. Speaking of stall, Uxie also has issues with defensive Pokemon if it does not run Yawn or Toxic. Cresselia and Registeel both have more than enough bulk to laugh off Uxie's attacks and can proceed to status it or set up. In addition, Uxie lacks a reliable means of recovery, so powerful or super effective moves from Pokemon such as Escavalier, Mismagius, and Houndoom can quickly wear it down.</p>
