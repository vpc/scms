[Overview]

<p>Cryogonal is one of the few Rapid Spin users in the Underused metagame with reliable recovery. It has a very good Special Defense stat, and its ability Levitate helps make it the second best spinner in the metagame, surpassed only by Claydol. While Claydol is bulkier overall, Cryogonal has a superior offensive presence and access to reliable recovery. Cryogonal's job is mainly to hit hard, as it plays the role of a specially defensive pivot that can utilize Rapid Spin. Furthermore, its extremely high Speed allows it to function as a fast specially defensive Rapid Spin user, similar to Tentacruel in OU. Finally, Cryogonal also sports Haze, which can neutralize Baton Pass users and setup sweepers. Unfortunately, Cryogonal has a bad defensive typing, which inflicts it with multiple weaknesses yet only grants it one resistance, and its extremely poor base 30 Defense means that most unresisted physical attacks can 2HKO it. Cryogonal is also very weak to one of the entry hazards that it’s supposed to remove from the field, Stealth Rock. Fortunately, Recover can help mitigate Stealth Rock damage, and Cryogonal's extremely high Special Defense means that it can actually take up to three Choice Scarf Nidoking Fire Blasts, a formidable feat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Cryogonal's ability Levitate makes it a great choice for spinning away Spikes and Toxic Spikes. With a Special Defense stat higher than that of Umbreon, Cryogonal can double as a special wall, and Recover helps it excel at that role by providing reliable recovery. Ice Beam is able to wear down opposing Pokemon and, thanks to Cryogonal's high Special Attack, is even able to OHKO or 2HKO multiple threats. These include the common Stealth Rock setter Gligar, the common Spikes setter Roserade, and the special tank Zapdos. Haze allows Cryogonal to put a stop to setup sweepers such as Togekiss and Raikou and also nullifies Baton Pass teams. Toxic is a plausible option to wear down Pokemon that can wall or set up on Cryogonal, such as Porygon2 and Snorlax. Reflect is extremely useful when dealing with physical attackers; using it on a predicted switch to a physical attacker, for example Arcanine or Heracross, can be very helpful throughout the course of a match.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>248 HP EVs give Cryogonal an HP stat that is indivisible by four, allowing it to take less damage from Stealth Rock when it switches in. You can give Cryogonal 168 Defense EVs, as this allows it to survive moderately powered physical attacks, such as a Flygon's Outrage, and OHKO back with Ice Beam. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to absorb hits from the Pokemon Cryogonal is supposed to wall.</p>

<p>The removal of opposing Steel- and Fire-types is useful for Cryogonal so that it can spin more freely, and several good potential teammates such as Slowbro and Swampert, which also form a solid defensive core with Cryogonal with their high Defense, can do just that. Slowbro, Cofagrigus, and Crobat are great teammates to handle Fighting-types that switch in on Cryogonal, and they can also benefit from the removal of entry hazards from the field. Partners that can take down hazard users are useful as well so that Cryogonal can spin just once and not have to worry about entry hazards for the rest of the game. Swampert and Shaymin are recommended for their efficacy in eliminating common Stealth Rock users such as Rhyperior and Empoleon. Finally, Pokemon that really love Spikes off the field, specifically bulky grounded Pokemon such as Snorlax, Rhyperior and Umbreon, appreciate Cryogonal as a teammate. Rhyperior loves the removal of Spikes, as this allows it to check Electric-types better, and it also has the advantage of resisting the Fire-type attacks that Cryogonal hates.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A high base Speed allows Cryogonal to outspeed most of the unboosted tier. Its high Special Attack permits it to hit hard with its STAB Ice Beam, enabling it to 2HKO mild offensive threats such as Raikou, Heracross, Mienshao, and more. Because this set will most likely be used on an offensive team, a fast Rapid Spin is useful for maintaining momentum and keeping sweepers healthy. Cryogonal is a solid offensive pivot as teammates greatly appreciate the removal of entry hazards, and it can also keep on the offensive pressure thanks to its hard hitting attacks.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Ground and Fire are useful for eliminating various Steel-types. Hidden Power Ground is absolutely necessary to take down Empoleon and even Fire-types such as the notable spinblocker Chandelure. Hidden Power Fire is useful for the rare Escavalier and Ferroseed, opposing Ice-types such as Abomasnow, and to a small extent Bronzong. Recover allows Cryogonal to reliably regain health and makes it a formidable threat against specially attacking opponents one-on-one.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The 216 Speed EVs are used to outspeed max Speed Timid base 100s, notably Zapdos, Shaymin, and Flygon. 252 Speed EVs can be used to tie with a few threats, notably Mienshao and Zoroark. 40 HP EVs are invested to give Cryogonal some bulk and an HP stat that is indivisible by four, reducing the amount of Stealth Rock damage it takes. An Icicle Plate can be used instead of a Life Orb if you feel that the residual damage from using Rapid Spin and Hidden Power is a waste of HP.</p>

<p>This set is considerably less bulky than the defensive set and should play to its own strengths. Teammates that can set up on its offensive switch-ins such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Snorlax can be very beneficial to the team. Pokemon that can beat spinblockers, such as offensive strikers like Raikou and Chandelure, make good teammates for Cryogonal. Pokemon that can set up on Cryogonal's counters, Snorlax, Mienshao, and Heracross, are also good partners. One example is offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus.</p>

<p>Cryogonal is rendered more powerful in UU thanks to the inclusion of hail. Hail teams permit Cryogonal to spam Blizzard, which is extremely painful when combined with Cryogonal's high Special Attack and Speed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dual screens with Light Clay is possible thanks to Cryogonal's great Speed; furthermore, with its high Special Defense, it finds many opportunities to set up on special attackers and walls. Frost Breath is a situational move that bypasses the defensive stat boosts of opponents such as Raikou; however, Haze is usually the better choice in such cases. Acid Armor is an interesting move that can patch up Cryogonal's weak Defense and turn it into an unbreakable wall. Cryogonal can be used as a Rain Dance supporter, as it can Rapid Spin for rain teams and the rain mitigates its Fire-type weakness.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Cryogonal is weak to Stealth Rock, so if you can prevent it from spinning this entry hazard away, it can be worn down fairly quickly. In addition, Cryogonal can be chased out by common Choice Scarfed physical attackers such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Flygon. However, they are unable to switch in directly due to Cryogonal's surprisingly powerful offensive presence. Fighting-types are decent checks, but they should be wary of Ice Beam from the offensive set. Steel- and Fire-types in general pose problems for Cryogonal. However, they can be worn down by the offensive set's Hidden Power Ground.</p>

<p>The best choice for a spinblocker that can be used to stop Cryogonal is Chandelure, with its useful Fire typing resisting Ice Beam. However, the offensive Cryogonal set has Hidden Power Ground, which can easily 2HKO Chandelure, and is also notably faster.</p>

<p>Snorlax is an extremely good counter to Cryogonal, as it has Thick Fat to nullify Ice Beam and hits hard physically. However, it is unable to prevent Cryogonal from spinning. Cobalion and Bronzong are also excellent counters, as they can set up Stealth Rock, can KO easily with their STABs, and resist Ice Beam; Cobalion is even able to outspeed and kill the offensive set. However, although Bronzong is unaffected by Hidden Power Ground, both of them might not be able to switch in safely on the offensive set's Hidden Power Fire. They also have no way of stopping Cryogonal from taking its usual best course of action and switching into an appropriate teammate so that it can spin away Stealth Rock at a later point in the game.</p>
