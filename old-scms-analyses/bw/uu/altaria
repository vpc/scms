[Overview]

<p>Since its introduction two generations ago, Altaria hasn't changed much. It pulls off both offensive and defensive roles quite effectively in UU. The key to its success lies in its access to Dragon Dance and STAB Dragon-type moves, allowing it to pose as an offensive threat despite its low Attack stat, and its defenses, which allow it to obtain multiple boosts easily. Altaria also has the Natural Cure ability along with great moves such as Heal Bell and Roost, allowing it to support its team. Overall, Altaria is a solid Pokemon in the Underused tier with multiple possibilities that should not be overlooked.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Roost
item: Life Orb
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Altaria takes quite an offensive approach with this set, aiming to deal damage hard and fast. Dragon Dance is Altaria's choice to boost its stats, reaching 393 Attack and 388 Speed with an Adamant nature after a single use. Outrage deals the most damage out of Altaria's physical Dragon-type moves, making it the primary option. Earthquake is Altaria's best coverage move, denting Steel-types that resist Outrage. Finally, Roost is used as Altaria's way to heal damage taken while sweeping, and its ability to take hits and heal off damage shouldn't be underestimated.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Adamant is the preferred nature since Altaria needs all the power it can get, but Jolly is an option for outspeeding base 130 Speed Pokemon such as Aerodactyl and Crobat after just one Dragon Dance. Fire Blast could be used over Roost to hit Escavalier, which is hit neutral by Earthquake, but Escavalier isn't common enough to be worth a moveslot. Altaria appreciates other Dragon-types as teammates, as they can wear down their similar counters and allow one another to sweep. Kingdra and Flygon are good Dragon-types to consider. Magneton is a good teammate as well, as it can trap and KO Escavalier, which can be troublesome otherwise. Lastly, Hitmontop can be a good check to Ice-types such as Weavile that could stop Altaria's sweep with Ice Shard.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulky Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Roost
move 3: Dragon Claw
move 4: Heal Bell / Safeguard
item: Leftovers
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 16 Atk / 176 SpD / 64 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike the previous set, which aims to deal damage quickly, this set attempts to use Altaria's natural defenses to gain multiple boosts before sweeping with a reliable move. Dragon Dance and Roost are the crux of this set, allowing Altaria to set up and heal. Dragon Claw is chosen over Outrage, as Dragon Claw is much more reliable, not forcing Altaria to be locked in or become confused. In the last slot, Heal Bell is an option to heal status that Altaria may take while setting up, but the move has problems with low PP. Safeguard has much higher PP and can protect Altaria and its teammates from status for five turns. It can't get rid of a status that's already there though, making it a bit risky. Altaria mostly sets up on Fire- and Grass-type Pokemon here, but it can also do so on Fighting-types that lack Stone Edge or even Water-types with low Special Attack, as Altaria can actually heal off their damage by using Roost on an incoming Ice Beam.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Altaria can invest some EVs in Attack at expense of its Special Defense, but this is not recommended due to the importance of its defenses on this set. Magneton again makes a solid teammate, trapping and KOing Steel-types that can easily get in Altaria's way with their resistance to Dragon-type moves. Hitmontop works as well, dealing with Ice-types wanting to get in an Ice Shard. Grass-types such as Shaymin are good teammates as well, providing a bit of backup against bulky Water-types, especially those with Roar, such as Suicune.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Dragon Pulse
move 2: Heal Bell
move 3: Roost
move 4: Perish Song / Toxic / Flamethrower
item: Leftovers
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Altaria reaches 354 HP and 339 Special Defense with the given EV spread, allowing it to wall a variety of special attackers when combined with its unique set of resistances, including Fire- and Grass-type moves. Dragon Pulse is Altaria's most reliable STAB move and has decent neutral coverage, but it won't hit very hard at all. Heal Bell is a very useful move to rid Altaria's team of status and isn't too widespread, allowing Altaria to fill a useful niche. Roost is its all-important healing move, letting it stay around for a good amount of time. Perish Song is preferred in the last slot as a way to phaze the opponent, though Altaria itself must switch after use or else it will be KOed. Toxic is another option to inflict deadly poison on bulkier Pokemon, wearing them down for teammates to finish off. Flamethrower can also be used to hit Steel-types that resist Dragon Pulse.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Roar is an alternative phazing move that works immediately if that is desired, although many other Pokemon can use that move to greater effect. Pokemon with Ice-type moves are the biggest threat to this Altaria. Examples of these are Nidoking, Weavile, and Froslass. Technician Hitmontop can use Mach Punch on Weavile which allows it to work well with Altaria. Snorlax is an option for a teammate that easily walls Nidoking, as Nidoking is almost always using specially-based sets. Snorlax can even take an Earthquake from a mixed set as well. Escavalier is another good teammate, able to take the moves Froslass uses and KOing with Pursuit. Steel-types in general have great synergy with Altaria, as together they combine to resist every type but Electric.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cotton Guard is a good move that can greatly raise Altaria's defense, and it could be used to try to stall. Sing is a sleep-inducing move, which is always useful, but its terrible accuracy makes it unreliable. Altaria can set up Sunny Day or Rain Dance for weather-based teams, and it can usually survive long enough to set up multiple times in a match.</p>

<p>Altaria could hit Fighting-types with Aerial Ace, but the move is quite weak even with STAB. Agility could also be used for the Speed boost, but Altaria's offensive stats are just too weak to use unboosted attacks. A Choice Specs set is possible, as Altaria learns Dragon Pulse, Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power, but Kingdra and even Flygon hit harder. Altaria gets FeatherDance, which can help against physical threats by lowering their Attack. Haze is yet another move that Altaria could use to get rid of stat boosts. Finally, Rest and Sleep Talk could be used nicely together for healing, and Natural Cure makes it much safer, as this means that the new sleep mechanics don't hurt Altaria.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ice-types can threaten to KO Altaria, making them major problems for any set. Weavile, Froslass, and Rotom-F and are all good examples of these. Steel-types can deal with any set without Earthquake or Fire Blast easily. Escavalier makes a better check, taking a neutral Earthquake with ease. Powerful bulky Water-types can take a hit and use Ice-type attacks in return, but need to watch out for a possible Toxic. Lastly, other Dragon-types such as Kingdra and Flygon can outspeed and deal massive damage to Altaria.</p>
