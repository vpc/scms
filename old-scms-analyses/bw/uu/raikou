[Overview]

<p>If you think Raikou is now considered less of a threat due to dropping from BL to UU this generation, you couldn't be more wrong. Its wide offensive movepool with coverage options such as Aura Sphere, Extrasensory, and Hidden Power, as well as access to Calm Mind all contribute to give Raikou a huge recognition in the tier as a powerful and versatile sweeper, having the ability to sweep through entire teams if you are not properly prepared to face it. Moreover, as a consequence of being considered as a legendary Pokemon, its defensive stats of 90 / 75 / 100 are not bad either, and that will result in a much easier time sweeping or taking a somewhat weak neutral attack.</p>

<p>It's not all roses and candies for Raikou though. Special walls such as Snorlax can ruin its sweep, and fast Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Krookodile can absorb an Electric-type move and OHKO with Earthquake. Using the event moves, namely Aura Sphere, forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, therefore reducing its speed to 329, outpacing only up to base 100 Speed Pokemon by the minimum margin. Even though Raikou has its flaws, it should never be underestimated, as with the proper support, it can shred teams apart easily.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Raikou's famous SubCM set returns for another round of pulverizing opponents in the BW2 UU metagame, and it is as good as ever. With Substitute, Raikou is provided with a pseudo immunity to status conditions that make it much less useful and can set up Calm Mind multiple times with ease on weak attackers such as Ferroseed, eventually amassing a gigantic Special Attack stat. Once it has set up, Raikou can go to town with its access to a powerful STAB Thunderbolt and great secondary coverage option in Hidden Power Ice, a combination resisted by only Rotom-H, Magneton, and Lanturn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread listed makes sure Raikou reaches its maximum Speed, while hitting hard before getting any Special Attack boosts. Raikou can also use Air Balloon to obtain more Calm Mind boosts on Ground-types, but the loss of recovery will cut short its sweep. A bulkier EV spread of 64 HP / 224 SpA / 216 Spe is also an option; with this, Raikou may keep its Substitute intact after a Calm Mind boost in the face of support Roserade's strongest move, Sludge Bomb, although it is guaranteed to be outsped by Azelf, Ambipom, Cinccino, and opposing Raikou that run max Speed. Aura Sphere might seem like a good alternative to Hidden Power Ice to hit Snorlax hard, but it forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, meaning that it loses the ability to outspeed Pokemon with over base 100 Speed and to set up on special attackers such as Zapdos and Roserade due to the drop of the Special Defense stat. Powerful Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Hitmontop make great offensive partners, as they can KO Snorlax with ease. Packing a Grass-type teammate, such as Roserade, Tangrowth or Shaymin, is also advisable as Swampert is a hard counter to this set. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, are very useful in aiding Raikou when it comes to eliminating its counters. Froslass, Qwilfish, and Roserade can all set up entry hazards, but the latter fits this role like a glove because Roserade not only sets up the said Spikes, but also forces out the likes of Swampert and Rhyperior, two of Raikou's main counters, meaning they will take additional hazard damage and thus will be weaker when they switch in on Raikou.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Isn't it great to have a fast Pokemon that hits hard without having to be locked into one single move? Well, if you answered "yes" Raikou is the perfect Pokemon for you! With its blistering Speed and above average Special Attack stat, Raikou is sure to pack a punch and stick around on your team for a while. Thunderbolt is a very strong and reliable STAB move that hits extremely hard with the Life Orb boost and it's the move you will probably be using the most. Hidden Power Ice gives Raikou the famous pseudo BoltBeam combo and annihilates Flygon and Gligar, whereas Hidden Power Grass OHKOes Swampert and Rhyperior, both being top checks to the thunder tiger when it is not packing a Grass-type move. Extrasensory is there specifically for Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, while dealing a lot of damage to the roaming Fighting-types in the tier. As for the last slot, Raikou has two very valuable options and the choice depends on the way you want to use it. Calm Mind provides Raikou an easier time sweeping by not only raising its Special Attack, but also raising its Special Defense, which allows it to set up on special attackers with ease and sweep. Volt Switch, on the other hand, helps Raikou to get away from a difficult situation, netting some good damage while scouting and gaining offensive momentum.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is a simple one: Special Attack and Speed are maximized to ensure optimum offensive ability. Life Orb is the preferred item for the offensive boost it brings to the table. Aura Sphere is an option over Extrasensory to hit Snorlax hard, preferably paired with Calm Mind, but it forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, allowing threats such as Cobalion and Azelf to outspeed and KO it. Tangrowth makes sure that Scarf Flygon and Scarf Krookodile don't wreck Raikou in one shot by taking their hits and retaliating with its STAB move or Hidden Power Ice. Raikou absolutely needs Snorlax out of the picture before it can start setting up; Fighting-types such as Heracross, Mienshao, and Hitmontop are thus great offensive partners. Entry hazard support from the likes of Froslass and Roserade helps immensely too, softening up potential counters and turning several 2HKOs into OHKOs. Raikou also appreciates having entry hazards off its side of the field, as the residual damage in conjunction with Life Orb recoil shortens its sweep; Hitmontop in particular is a fantastic choice for providing Rapid Spin support, as it also has Fighting-type STAB to finish off Snorlax.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Being one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier plus having a fearsome Special Attack stat, Raikou is an excellent user of Choice Specs. When equipped, it boosts Raikou's Special Attack stat to 493 right off the bat, allowing it to wreck havoc as soon as it comes in. Thunderbolt is a menace to everything that does not resist it or is immune to it and is Raikou's strongest move. Although it is not its strongest move, Volt Switch is an amazing choice as a secondary STAB move as it not only allows Raikou to get out of a sticky situation but it also deals a powerful blow to the opponent in the process. To prevent Raikou from being walled by Ground-type Pokemon, Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass are required, the former dealing with potential Flygon switch-ins and Gligar whereas the latter deals with Swampert and Rhyperior easily. As for the last slot, Extrasensory is Raikou's best way to deal with Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, all of which are able to take any other of Raikou's moves and put it to sleep with Sleep Powder or retaliate with Earth Power, respectively.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread listed provides Raikou as much power and Speed as possible in order to punch holes through the opponent's team. Aura Sphere is a good alternative to use on the set to deal with Snorlax better; however, in this scenario, Rash must be used over Timid as a nature. As Ground-types, such as Flygon, Krookodile, and Rhyperior, are immune to Electric-type attacks, they are common switch-ins to Raikou. For this reason, having a Grass-type on your team, such as Shaymin, Roserade, or Tangrowth is going to allow Raikou to perform its job a lot more easily. Due to its sheer power, Raikou will be causing a lot of switches and at the same time gaining momentum and switch initiative with Volt Switch. As such, entry hazards support is advisable, and Qwilfish, Froslass, and Roserade are all good partners. To prevent Raikou from getting damaged by entry hazards due to switching in and out constantly, Rapid Spin support should be used. Both Hitmontop and Blastoise are good team members: the former deals with Snorlax and takes physical hits well due to Intimidate, while the latter is a better choice overall as a spinner and can take care of Ground-types easily.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gifted with a very promising Speed stat, Raikou can certainly make good use of it when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Raikou's strongest and most reliable STAB move and it is very useful to clean up late-game once Ground-types are out of the picture. Volt Switch allows Raikou to make a quick getaway when needed while dealing a very respectable amount of damage in the process. Hidden Power Ice makes Raikou an extremely good Choice Scarf Flygon and Gligar revenge killer, as Raikou outspeeds them and OHKOes Flygon whilst taking out Gligar in one shot after Stealth Rock. Raikou can run either a Rash nature when paired with Aura Sphere to hit Snorlax, Weavile, and Krookodile or a Timid nature when paired with Extrasensory to hit Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, although the former is preferable. However, take into account that Raikou outpaces Pokemon with base 100 Speed with a Rash nature whereas it ties with Pokemon with base 115 Speed when running Timid nature while also having the ability to outspeed Modest Kingdra in the rain.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread given lets Raikou outpace as many Pokemon as possible while dealing as much damage as it possibly can. It should be used mainly as a late-game cleaner, as it does not have the raw power of the Choice Specs set, but it's also good to rack up some damage mid-game with Volt Switch. It absolutely loves having entry hazards on the opponent's field to ensure a few more kills and to help its partners wearing your opponent's team down with switch initiative and constant damage. Roserade, Froslass, and Qwilfish are perfect for this job. Once again, Raikou will most likely be switching in and out often, so Rapid Spin support is advisable. Both Hitmontop and Blastoise are good options.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Raikou's movepool might not be gigantic, but it still provides some additional moves to consider. Shadow Ball might seem like a good coverage option to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types, but most are hit hard enough by Thunderbolt anyway. Charge Beam can be used on the Choice set to give Raikou a way of boosting its stats, but it takes two boosts for it to hit harder than unboosted Thunderbolt, and even then, special walls such as Snorlax stop Raikou comfortably. ExtremeSpeed can pick off frail or weakened opponents, but it won't be doing much otherwise with Raikou's poor Attack stat and also forces Raikou to sacrifice a nature that boosts Speed, one of its biggest assets. Raikou can also help a teammate set up by running Reflect and Light Screen. A RestTalk set with Calm Mind and Thunderbolt can also be used to help Raikou have an easier time setting up due to its overall good bulk, but it is completely walled by Ground-types and is a bit unreliable. Its movepool even includes Rain Dance and Sunny Day; Raikou can thus set up weather easily with its high Speed, although Uxie outclasses it with its superior bulk. It should be noted, however, that Raikou can exploit either weather very well thanks to its access to a perfectly accurate Thunder in the rain as well as Weather Ball. Finally, Thunder Wave combined with Raikou's high Speed allow it to spread paralysis, but this job is generally better left to bulkier teammates.</p>

<p>An especially notable option is Roar, which Raikou can use alongside Calm Mind to accomplish a couple different things. The first of which is winning Calm Mind wars by setting up a few times then using Roar, which leaves your opponent in a tough spot, having to deal with a boosted Raikou with an unboosted Pokemon. The second is the weakening of its counters, all of which happen to be vulnerable to Spikes, which Raikou is commonly paired with.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Despite Raikou's power, there are several reliable checks and counters to it. Sets lacking Hidden Power Grass are walled cold by Swampert: it is immune to Thunderbolt and sponges even boosted coverage attacks with ease, while OHKOing with Earthquake. Snorlax is able to take boosted Aura Spheres easily with its excellent Special Defense and can OHKO or 2HKO with Earthquake or Return, respectively. Specially Defensive Rhyperior is also able to defeat Raikou with Earthquake, especially if it lacks Hidden Power Grass, although it can also take one if it is unboosted. Fast Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Krookodile make great checks to Raikou too, as they can switch into Thunderbolt and OHKO with Earthquake, although they will still get wrecked by Hidden Power Ice. Powerful Choice Scarf users like Heracross can also easily revenge kill Raikou with a super effective Earthquake after Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. Bronzong can also take some of Raikou's hits and retaliate with Earthquake. Raikou is also vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards: Stealth Rock and multiple layers of Spikes severely limit its ability to switch in, while Toxic Spikes can cut short its sweep.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Raikou receives an excellent hidden ability in Volt Absorb. This enables it to switch into Electric-type attacks and heal off any damage taken from entry hazards as well as handing it a nifty immunity to Thunder Wave. Although currently unreleased, Volt Absorb will be the ability of choice on all of Raikou's sets except for the Substitute + Calm Mind set, which appreciates the ability to stall moves such as Stone Edge out of their meager PP in conjunction with Substitute. However, note that Raikou might be unable to use the fourth generation event move Aura Sphere with Volt Absorb.</p>
