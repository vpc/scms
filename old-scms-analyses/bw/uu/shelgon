[Overview]

<p>Last generation, Shelgon was seldom considered outside of NU, as it has lackluster base stats despite being the pre-evolution of the mighty Salamence. Shelgon's horrible Special Defense, Speed, and HP stats aren't its only problems; its mediocre base 95 Attack leaves much to be desired. However, with the generous gift of the Eviolite, Shelgon can fill a specific role on your team as a physically defensive Pokemon. With access to Wish and Roar, Shelgon can function as an effective Dragon-type wall, standing out from its competitors. Furthermore, Shelgon can be a defensive Dragon Dance sweeper, enabling it to shrug off physical blows while setting up. With all these traits, Shelgon has a valuable niche in UU.</p>

<p>Defensive Dragon Dance is the way to go on Shelgon. An offensive Dragon Dance set makes Shelgon completely inferior to Kingdra, so it's best to abuse Rest + Sleep Talk and the Eviolite. With key resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric, an amazing offensive type in Dragon, and a great Defense stat, Shelgon can shrug off hits while it sets up. Rest and Sleep Talk allow you to recover health and set up or attack while asleep. Outrage is a neat STAB move that tears holes in most non-Steel-type Pokemon after a few Dragon Dances. This rinse-and-repeat combination allows Shelgon to pose as a threat to the opponent. The given EV spread provides Shelgon with some special bulk as it already has a high Defense stat, allowing Shelgon to take most attacks with ease. The 28 Speed EVs allow Shelgon to comfortably outspeed Pokemon with a base Speed of 110 after three Dragon Dances instead of four.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Dragon Claw serves as a fine option over Outrage if you feel that the confusion from Outrage will get the better of Shelgon. Keep in mind, however, that when Outrage is executed during Sleep Talk, it will not leave Shelgon confused, nor will it lock Shelgon into Outrage. Utilizing a Careful nature isn’t recommended, as the Defense bonus from the Impish nature is generally higher than the Special Defense boost granted to you by a Careful nature. Although it appears that Wish is superior to Rest and Sleep Talk, Wish is illegal with Dragon Dance.</p>

<p>Shelgon loathes Ice-types, especially Abomasnow, which can claim an OHKO on Shelgon with a chilling Blizzard. Slowbro or Slowking carrying  Flamethrower or Fire Blast can barbecue Abomasnow and its band of Ice-types, and Scald deals super effective damage to Ground-type Pokemon that wall Shelgon. Empoleon is an amazing partner for Shelgon; it sets up Stealth Rock, enabling Shelgon to nab a few KOs with Outrage after Stealth Rock damage, and sponges Ice-type attacks that would make short work of Shelgon. In addition, Shelgon resists the Electric-type moves that target the metallic penguin.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Shelgon is unique from other Dragon-types, as it is more defensively oriented and obtains Wish. Shelgon can be a chore to take down without special attacks; in fact, this variant carries as much physical  bulk as a Cresselia with the same EV spread and nature! Shelgon also supports one's team with 167 HP Wishes. Wish and Protect allow you to restore HP to take more physical blows, and Protect acts as an excellent scouting move as well. Toxic allows Shelgon to break through walls that are not Steel- or Poison-type. Roar is useful in conjunction with entry hazards, in paticular Toxic Spikes, and it can also phaze away physical attackers that attempt to set up on Shelgon. Dragon Claw takes the cake in the last slot as a reliable STAB attack. It prevents Shelgon from being a complete Taunt bait while giving a way to deal consistent damage to the opponent.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Body Slam is an option over Toxic or Roar if paralysis support is necessary. However, it is unreliable, only paralyzing the opposing Pokemon 30% of the time, so it is generally inferior. An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature merits a mention to abuse Shelgon's unique resistances, but it no longer takes physical attacks as well as it could; Choice Band Heracross always 2HKOes 252 HP / 4 Def Shelgon with Close Combat, even with Eviolite.</p>

<p>As always, Shelgon struggles with Ice-types, such as Abomasnow and  Froslass. Hitmontop destroys Ice- and Steel-type Pokemon, and can make  use of Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, enabling Shelgon to switch in without receiving entry hazard damage. Scolipede and Nidoqueen can set up Toxic Spikes, while the former can even lay Spikes to maximize Shelgon's walling potential and allowing Roar to force the opponent to take entry hazards damage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Shelgon's choices are essentially limited to those listed in the sets. Brick Break cannot really fit into a moveslot on the sets, as it is quite weak, even when hitting super effectively. Although Shelgon can use an offensive EV spread on the Dragon Dance set, it is outclassed by other Dragon Dance users, such as Kingdra, which boasts better coverage, higher offensive stats, and is not dependent on Eviolite.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Trick or Knock Off is especially threatening to Shelgon, removing its precious Eviolite. Trick will likely bestow upon Shelgon a Choice item, which will ruin its attempts to set up with Dragon Dance from that moment on. Nevertheless, Protect can guard against Trick and Knock Off. Super effective  attacks, even physical ones, can force out or crush Shelgon. Fraxure, Kingdra, and Altaria can simply spam Outrage to fell  our pupa-staged dragon.  Steel-types walk all over Shelgon and take practically nothing from Shelgon's STAB attacks. Mismagius and Mew can burn Shelgon with Will-O-Wisp, crippling Shelgon and preventing it from doing much damage. Kingdra that have managed to set up two Dragon Dances wreck physically defensive Shelgon with Outrage if the shelled dragon lacks Roar. Kingdra with one Dragon Dance annihilates defensive Dragon Dance Shelgon with Outrage.</p>
