[Overview]

<p>The Blast Pokemon is once again back in UU, and this time round, it is here to stay. With wonderfully distributed stats and a wide movepool, Magmortar has the potential to 2HKO everything in the tier, getting past the bulky Water-types it loathes with a Thunderbolt backed by its base 125 Special Attack. However, Magmortar has a poor defensive typing, with its lack of resistances and gaping weaknesses leaving it vulnerable to common attacking types. Stealth Rock is also no friend of Magmortar, chipping off 25% of its HP each time it switches in. On top of that, Magmortar has an average Speed stat, which means it is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon. Despite these shortcomings, when Magmortar is on the field, you'll want to make sure those big cannons it has aren't pointed at you.</p> 

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Cross Chop
item: Life Orb
nature: Naughty
evs: 64 HP / 164 Atk / 252 SpA / 28 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is probably Magmortar's best set, and for one good reason: it allows Magmortar to bypass the number one threat to any special attacker: Chansey. Thanks to its excellent offensive stats, Magmortar often has no trouble defeating both physical and special walls. With a Naughty nature and 164 Attack EVs, even the defensive behemoth that is Eviolite Chansey will fall to two Cross Chops after Stealth Rock damage. Maximum Special Attack investment further powers up its STAB Fire Blast and Thunderbolt, while 28 Speed EVs allow Magmortar to outspeed minimum Speed Suicune and launch a Thunderbolt at it. The leftover EVs are dumped into HP to slightly increase its bulk. The type of Hidden Power used depends on what you need Magmortar to hit. Hidden Power Grass is 4x super effective against certain foes that resist Fire Blast and Thunderbolt, such as Rhyperior and Quagsire; alternatively, Hidden Power Ice nabs KOs on the likes of Flygon and Altaria. Hidden Power Ice also provides Magmortar with pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, which in UU is resisted only by Rotom-H.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Expert Belt can be used if you feel that the recoil from Life Orb is off-putting, or to feign a Choice item. However, Life Orb is usually the better item, as it secures the 2HKO on Chansey after Stealth Rock damage. Due to its incredible firepower, Magmortar can easily open holes in the opponent's team, paving the way for a teammate to sweep. Rock Polish Rhyperior is ironically a good teammate, as if Magmortar runs Hidden Power Grass to remove opposing Rhyperior, yours can sweep more easily. A Grass-type such as Shaymin is also a great teammate, as it resists the Water- and Ground-type attacks that Magmortar never fails to attract. Conversely, Magmortar can comfortably switch into a Bug- or Fire-type attack targeting its Grass-type teammate. Lastly, an alternate EV spread of 164 Atk / 92 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature can be use to outpace base 80 Speed foes such as Mamoswine and Togekiss.</p> 

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Fire Blast / Overheat
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
nature: Modest / Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Magmortar becomes a potent revenge killer; when equipped with Choice Specs, it hits like a mortar. Fire Blast is Choice Scarf Magmortar's main STAB move, as it allows Magmortar to clean up weakened teams late game. However, Choice Specs variants prefer Overheat for maximum damage output, as this hit-and-run Magmortar often doesn't stay in for more than one turn. Thunderbolt deals with the many Water-type Pokemon that resist Magmortar's Fire-type STAB move, and Focus Blast decimates Chansey, Snorlax, and Houndoom; Snorlax is 2HKOed by Choice Specs Focus Blast, and Houndoom is OHKOed by even Choice Scarf Focus Blast. Hidden Power patches up the holes in Magmortar's coverage, enabling it to KO some of the Pokemon that resist the first two moves; Hidden Power Grass allows Magmortar to defeat Quagsire and Rhyperior, while Hidden Power Ice lets Magmortar wreck Altaria and Flygon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given nature and EV spread allow Choice Scarf Magmortar to outpace positive natured maximum base 130 Speed foes, such as Jolteon and Aerodactyl. After Stealth Rock damage, Magmortar is able to OHKO them with Overheat and Thunderbolt, respectively. Choice Specs Magmortar, on the other hand, should utilize a Timid nature to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mamoswine. Although Focus Blast helps in taking down Chansey, strong Fighting-types such as Heracross are great partners to aid in the removal of the pink blob.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thanks to its wide movepool, Magmortar has many other options to choose from. It has access to many viable physical moves such as Earthquake, ThunderPunch, Flare Blitz, and Rock Slide and can run a Substitute + Focus Punch set to tackle Chansey even more easily; it also receives the infamous boosting move Belly Drum. More feasibly, Magmortar can alleviate its Speed issues with Flame Charge, but it usually cannot spare the moveslot. Although Magmortar has access to Taunt, it is usually better off running an all-out offensive set. Barrier is a gimmicky option at best, but it allows Magmortar to survive Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquake and KO it with Hidden Power Ice. Magmortar also has a few nifty moves, such as Swagger, Screech, and Torment, making it a frustrating Pokemon to take down. Psychic is a plausible option to further make use of its wonderful Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chansey is a hard counter to any set without Cross Chop or Focus Punch; it takes very little from all of Magmortar's other attacks, and in return can cripple Magmortar with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Milotic has enough bulk to survive a Thunderbolt and can threaten Magmortar with Scald. Azumarill can come in on a resisted Fire-type attack and threaten to KO Magmortar with Aqua Jet. Lanturn resists Magmortar's STAB moves and is immune to Thunderbolt thanks to Volt Absorb, and as such is a solid check to Magmortar. Regirock's impressive special bulk in the sand allows it to tank most of Magmortar's attacks as well. Altaria is a great counter to any set lacking Hidden Power Ice. Rhyperior can take Cross Chops, and is barely scratched by any move not named Hidden Power Grass.</p>
