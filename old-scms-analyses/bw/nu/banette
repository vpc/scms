[Overview]

<p>Banette is a very unfortunate case. While its offensive stats are very solid, it suffers from the fact that it is simply too frail and slow to make any use of said stats the majority of the time. Its movepool doesn't help its case either, since it is fairly dry on offensive options, further limiting any offensive potential it might have had. Banette does have one small niche, however, as a suicidal Trick Room lead. It can set up Trick Room for its team while taking itself down in the process; therefore, don't expect too much out of Banette otherwise.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Banette's best and only way to effectively contribute to its team. This set should always take the lead position, as it should very rarely stay around for long. Its main role is to support slower team members with Trick Room, hopefully taking down an opponent in the process. Its middling defenses and Speed are also key to this set's success. Taunt is an effective tool to stop the opponent's setup opportunities, especially from the likes of Scolipede and Carracosta. Shadow Claw provides a reasonably strong STAB attack for Banette to use, and prevents it from being complete Taunt bait. Curse, on the other hand, is useful against any Pokemon that refuses to outright defeat Banette after it has done its job; aside from wearing down an opponent for your sweepers to sweep better, it will quickly guarantee Banette's demise. Finally, Destiny Bond is useful for Banette to potentially take down an opponent after it has done its job.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread, IVs, and nature minimize Banette's already upsetting defenses and Speed to allow it to reach its Focus Sash more easily and outspeed plenty of opponents under Trick Room. Focus Sash is necessary in order for Banette to set up Trick Room successfully, as Banette is a frail Pokemon in general. Insomnia is the preferred ability, as it allows Banette to ignore sleep moves from the likes of Jynx's and Jumpluff and hence set up Trick Room on them. Because Banette is running Trick Room, it is necessary to pair it up with slow and powerful Pokemon, such as Marowak, Relicanth, Eelektross, and Golurk. Other Trick Room users, such as Exeggutor and Musharna, are also advisable to put less pressure on Banette for its role.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>As previously stated, Banette has quite a miserable movepool, which means there isn't much for it to put to good use. It has some useful priority attacks in Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak, but its lack of STAB on the former makes Banette a mediocre user of it. Choice Band and Choice Specs are certainly possibilities, but it is outclassed by Golurk and Sawk as Choice Band users, with Trick being its one and only niche over them. It can also support its team with Sunny Day or Rain Dance, and has Thunder to take advantage of the latter, but this role is better left to other Pokemon such as Regirock and Ludicolo. Banette also has some support options in Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Disable, Toxic, Pain Split, Calm Mind, and Cotton Guard. Unfortunately, Banette's bulk is too disappointing put any of these moves to good use.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Kangaskhan can utilize Scrappy along with a combination of Fake Out and Double-Edge to ensure Banette accomplishes nothing. Taunt users such as Mandibuzz, Samurott, and Serperior are also useful to stop Banette from doing its job, especially if it lacks Shadow Claw in favor of Curse. Skuntank can also do this, and can also use Pursuit to break the Focus Sash. Marowak, Golem, and Piloswine can use multi-hit moves to break Banette's Focus Sash and potentially eliminate it from the match. It is noteworthy that it is usually the slow powerhouses under Trick Room that pose the legitimate threat; Banette itself is not extraordinarily threatening.</p>
