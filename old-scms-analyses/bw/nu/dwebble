[Overview]

<p>Dwebble has a very useful niche on heavy offense teams in NU, as it can lay down both Stealth Rock and Spikes quickly. Unfortunately, that is all the little crab can do, as it is only useful because of the entry hazards it provides and its ability, Sturdy. It also faces competition from Focus Sash Scolipede, who is faster, harder to Taunt, brings offensive presence, and isn't killed by Mold Breaker Sawk. Dwebble does have Stealth Rock, something Scolipede lacks. Nonetheless, it has a great niche and should never be overlooked if you're looking for an entry hazard setter while building a team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dwebble is a great lead, and it is not meant to live throughout the game. What separates it from the other entry hazards users is its ability to use both Spikes and Stealth Rock. These two moves are mandatory on this set, and with a Custap Berry and Sturdy, Dwebble is almost always guaranteed at least Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. The third move depends on what you prefer: Endure allows Dwebble to survive a hit and get to Custap range after Sturdy has been broken or when an attack didn't do enough damage to get there. Knock Off is useful to cripple Misdreavus, as thanks to its Levitate ability, it doesn't take much damage from entry hazards, and its immunity to Spikes is very annoying for Dwebble's teammates. Endure is almost always the superior option, though, because Knock Off's only real uses is to cripple Misdreavus. The last moveslot, Rock Blast, is mostly a filler and prevents occasional Ninjask leads setting up on you while it lays down entry hazards.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Jolly and max Speed makes Dwebble as fast as possible, and allows it to outspeed the most common Taunt user, Misdreavus, before it can prevent Dwebble from doing its job. A few HP EVs paired with Endure allows it to lay down a few entry hazards while taking some hits, but if you opt to use Knock Off in lieu of Endure, 0 HP EVs and 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense can be used to reach Custap Berry range more easily. Toxic can be used over Rock Blast if you're using Knock Off in the third moveslot, as Rock Blast is very weak without (and even with) investment.</p> 

<p>Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, Drifblim, Haunter, and Golurk, are Dwebble's best friends, as they can prevent the opponent's Pokemon from using Rapid Spin and spinning away the entry hazards. In terms of good teammates, offensive teams love Dwebble's support, and nearly all sweepers benefit from the quick entry hazards it provides.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Entry hazards are the only reason to use Dwebble in NU, and there are no better options than what is in the Custap Berry set. Dwebble has a very shallow movepool, so there are not many other options. You can attempt an offensive approach with a Shell Smash set consisting of Stone Edge, X-Scissor, and Earthquake, but even at +2, Dwebble is still weak and fails to hit hard.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Taunt is a very effective method of dispatching of Dwebble, so Skuntank and Serperior can do a good job of keeping it in check. They can force it out, and if it doesn't switch back in fast enough, Stealth Rock can break its Sturdy. Pokemon that commonly carry multi-hit moves such as Rock Blast Golem and Icicle Spear Piloswine are also threatening because they tend to lead and are able to break through Dwebble's Sturdy and KO it. However, it's worth noting that the latter is only a problem for Knock Off variants as Piloswine can't OHKO through Sturdy with negative investment. Mold Breaker Sawk also gives problems to Dwebble. Lastly, Rapid Spin users are the bane of its existence; even if you carry a spinblocker, there are some Rapid Spin users, such as Shell Smash Torkoal and Foresight Wartortle, that can beat them.</p>
