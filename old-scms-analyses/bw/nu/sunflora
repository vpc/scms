[Overview]

<p>Based solely on appearances, Sunflora is not the most threatening Pokemon around. That harmless guise is just a ploy, however. If every rose has its thorns, this sunflower comes packing a full-on machete. Base 105 Special Attack might seem only above average, but with a boost from Solar Power in the sun, it can be deadly. Sunflora's decent-at-best bulk and terrible Speed aren't winning it any awards, however. Though Sunflora can use Chlorophyll to make up for its lacking speed, its Special Attack ceases to be as impressive as it is with Solar Power and it becomes sorely outclassed by the likes of Exeggutor. It might be slow and frail, but this flower packs one hell of a punch. It's also super cute!</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sunny Day is the first move Sunflora should be using, unless sun is already up; otherwise, it fails to be effective at anything. SolarBeam is Sunflora's main weapon, as its high Base Power, STAB, and lack of a charge turn in sun is a huge draw. Hidden Power Rock offers good coverage, though Hidden Power Fire is also a solid choice, and it gets a boost from sun to boot. Morning Sun is the best option for the last slot, as Sunflora's health is slowly depleted each turn by Solar Power and Morning Sun heals an impressive 66% in sun. Earth Power is an option for greater coverage, however, and becomes a pseudo-QuakeEdge combination alongside Hidden Power Rock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature and 236 Speed EVs allow Sunflora to outrun as many foes as possible. Special Attack is also maximized for greatest damage output, with the remnants used in HP, giving Sunflora an extra bit of bulk. Solar Power allows Sunflora to hit as hard as possible, though Chlorophyll is an option for more Speed. Unfortunately, Exeggutor has Sunflora beat as a special attacking Chlorophyll sweeper. Heat Rock is the preferred item, as it increases the duration of sun to eight turns, which Sunflora deeply needs to accomplish anything. If your team already has plenty of sun support, however, Life Orb is an option for even more damage. Bear in mind that the added residual damage from Life Orb and Solar Power will quickly drain Sunflora's health.</p>

<p>Anything that benefits from sun will obviously appreciate Sunflora setting it up. While Exeggutor might outclass it as a Chlorophyll sweeper, the two can be used alongside one another to weaken their counters. Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Shiftry are also great partners, as their physical attacks can break through special walls for Sunflora. Charizard is one of the top threats in the tier, and it becomes all the more potent under sun. Regirock is another great ally, as it can set up Sunny Day and lures in Water-types that Sunflora can easily switch in against.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sunflora has access to Encore, which can be useful in helping a teammate set up. It can also set up on its own with Growth, which boosts its Attack and Special Attack by two stages under sun, but Sunflora's frailty limits its opportunities to set up. Substitute can be used to ease prediction and protect against status, but the loss of HP from Solar Power means that Sunflora's lifespan will be cut even shorter. Finally, Sunflora can function as a suicide sun lead, setting up Sunny Day while clinging to life with a Focus Sash. With a Speed boost from Chlorophyll, it can then abuse a quick Endeavor to severely weaken its opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Being both slow and frail, Sunflora is not exactly a tough foe to defeat. Fast sweepers, such as Rotom-S, can outspeed even Chlorophyll Sunflora in sun and easily OHKO it. Choice Scarf users in general will outspeed and have little trouble revenge killing the frail Sunflora. If Sunflora doesn't run Hidden Power Rock, Braviary becomes a huge threat as well. Anything that can tank a SolarBeam, such as Roselia, can also easily beat Sunflora.</p>
