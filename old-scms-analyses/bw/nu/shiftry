[Overview]

<p>With its good attacking stats, Shiftry is an incredibly effective mixed attacker that can punch holes in teams with its various coverage moves, such as Leaf Storm, Nature Power, and Dark Pulse. Shiftry's access to priority in Sucker Punch means despite its average Speed, it can still hold its own against faster offensive teams. Sucker Punch also makes Shiftry a dangerous Swords Dance user, as nothing faster than Shiftry likes taking a boosted Sucker Punch. However, having a 4x weakness to U-turn and being frail in general means it can be checkmated rather easily by Pokemon such as Primeape and Braviary, while having difficulty switching into an attack or boosting with Swords Dance. Its typing is both a blessing an a curse; it's very useful for checking dangerous Pokemon such as Swords Dance Samurott and Exeggutor, but it also leaves Shiftry easily walled by common threats such as Mandibuzz and Bulk Up Braviary.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is very dangerous and versatile because it has a move for almost every situation. Leaf Storm is Shiftry's strongest attack and hits extremely hard, even against Pokemon that resist it, such as Braviary and Garbodor. Sucker Punch allows Shiftry to pick off faster threats such as Charizard, Scolipede, and Jynx, as well as weakened Pokemon. Dark Pulse is Shiftry's secondary special STAB attack and does good damage to Pokemon that resist Grass such as Scolipede, Exeggutor, Charizard, and Tangela. Nature Power rounds out Shiftry's coverage by hitting Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon, such as Skuntank, Roselia, Metang, and Probopass.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>176 Speed EVs allow Shiftry to outspeed Modest Ludicolo and Samurott while 88 Attack EVs let Shiftry OHKO Charizard with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Roselia with Nature Power after Stealth Rock. Max Speed and a Mild nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Sawk and Speed tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon, but Shiftry has to sacrifice Attack EVs and loses out on a lot of power. Early Bird is a somewhat situational ability, but it allows Shiftry to check Choice Scarf Jynx more easily, as it's not afraid of being put to sleep if it predicts wrong with Sucker Punch. It also makes Shiftry a very good offensive check to Exeggutor as it doesn't fear its STABs or Sleep Powder very much. Explosion is an interesting move that allows Shiftry to damage specially defensive walls such as Roselia, Regice, and Mandibuzz so that a partner such as Samurott or Haunter can break through them more easily. Giga Drain is a good option, as it means Shiftry won't have to deal with Leaf Storm's Special Attack drops when picking off Pokemon such as Samurott or Golem, and it allows Shiftry to heal off Life Orb recoil. The main problem with Giga Drain is that Shiftry has to give up a move to use it, and it can't really afford to lose any of its attacks. Nasty Plot can be used over Nature Power and alongside Giga Drain so that Shiftry can make the most out of its special attacks if it finds a chance to set up. Entry hazard support is appreciated, as Shiftry gets some key KOs with it; it 2HKOes Roselia with Nature Power after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Charizard with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock, 2HKOes Metang with Nature Power after one layer of Spikes, and OHKOes Ludicolo with Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock. Golurk in particular is a good partner, as it can get up Stealth Rock and take on the Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Shiftry. Garbodor can also take on Fighting-type Pokemon and can set up Spikes, while Shiftry takes down the Ground-types that give Garbodor trouble.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Shiftry's access to Sucker Punch makes it an incredibly dangerous Swords Dance sweeper, as most faster opponents are incapable of taking a boosted hit. That being said, due to Shiftry's bad defensive typing and mediocre 90 / 60 / 60 defenses, it can have some difficulty setting up. However, it can use some of its resistances and the fear that its mixed attacker set gives off to set up against Pokemon such as Musharna, Alomomola, and Exeggutor. Sucker Punch is extremely powerful once boosted, even capable of OHKOing Primeape after Stealth Rock damage and OHKOing the majority of offensive Pokemon. Seed Bomb is Shiftry's secondary STAB and allows Shiftry to break through common physical walls, such as Regirock and Alomomola, without any trouble. Nature Power rounds out the coverage, hitting Steel-type Pokemon such as Metang and Klang, OHKOing both after a boost.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature can be used so that Shiftry can outspeed Adamant Sawk and Speed tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon, but Shiftry misses out on the power and is generally using Sucker Punch anyway. Muk, Garbodor, and Scolipede are good teammates for Shiftry, as they can all deal with the Fighting-types that give Shiftry trouble. They can also capable of beating Tangela, Substitute variants of Serperior, and supporting it in other ways: Garbodor and Scolipede can both set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to cripple Tangela and Serperior, while Muk walls both of them while spreading Poison to Tangela via Poison Jab and Poison Touch. Memento Muk in particular works very well with Shiftry, as Memento can give Shiftry the free opportunity to set up a Swords Dance and sweep.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Shiftry can use a Sunny Day set with Chlorophyll and SolarBeam to attempt to sweep teams, but setting up Sunny Day can be difficult. Additionally, if not done, Shiftry cannot use its Grass STAB reliably. Tailwind gives the same Speed boost as Sunny Day and also supports its teammates; however, using Tailwind gives up a moveslot that Shiftry could be using for something more important. Leaf Storm can be used along with Power Swap, but Shiftry has neither the moveslots nor the bulk to be attempting such a set. Substitute can be used, as Shiftry tends to force many switches, but like most of its other options, it cannot afford to give up any moveslots.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Shiftry can be hard to counter directly, but it is easy to check due to its frailty and poor defensive typing. Mandibuzz and specially defensive Zweilous wall Shiftry regardless of the set and can both phaze Shiftry out if it tries setting up. Bulk Up Braviary walls the mixed attacker set and fares decently against the Swords Dance variants. Both Klang and Regice do very well against mixed Shiftry, but a boosted attack from Swords Dance variants can easily cripple them. Specially defensive Ludicolo can take two Leaf Storms&mdash;even after Stealth Rock&mdash;and heal itself with Synthesis to wear Shiftry down with Life Orb recoil. However, against Swords Dance variants, Ludicolo becomes prey, as Shiftry can easily set up on it and only fears a burn from Scald. Fighting-types such as Primeape, Sawk, and Gurdurr destroy Shiftry, and Primeape in particular also uses U-turn, which can give it the advantage even if Shiftry switches out.</p>
