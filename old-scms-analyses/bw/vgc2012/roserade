[Overview]

<p>While the presence of Amoonguss overshadows Roserade, Roserade is not a Pokemon that should be overlooked. Utilizing its undervalued STAB moves, Roserade can take down some common threats in the metagame. Boasting an outstanding base 125 Special Attack, a respectable base 90 Speed, and a great base 105 Special Defense, Roserade can be a powerhouse with proper team support and easily fits onto most teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Roserade's best STAB moves. Leaf Storm is a great move to have on hand, being able to destroy the opposition easily; the Special Attack drop it causes is greatly mitigated by the length of VGC battles. Sludge Bomb is Roserade's second STAB move, OHKOing Abomasnow and Breloom as well as having a good chance to OHKO Ludicolo. Hidden Power Fire smashes Scizor, while Hidden Power Ice dents Garchomp and Salamence. Protect is a staple in VGC, shielding Roserade for a turn while its teammate can eliminate her threats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>While neither of Roserade's abilities are very useful in VGC, Poison Point is the more useful ability, forcing physical attackers to think twice before hitting Roserade with contact moves. However, Poison Point does conflict with teams hoping to abuse status, and in that case, Natural Cure should be used. In the fast-paced VGC metagame, Gems are some of the most useful items as they provide the user with a single super-powered move, often turning 2HKOs into OHKOs without the drawbacks of using Choice Specs or a Choice Band. Grass Gem in combination with Leaf Storm smacks everything hard; it even OHKOes Tyranitar in sand. A Life Orb can be used to make Roserade useful even after she fires off a STAB Leaf Storm. Giga Drain provides a safer route if the drop in Special Attack is unappealing, but the decrease in power is significant. Shadow Ball can help lessen the threat of common Psychic- and Ghost-types. Roserade needs a teammate that can alleviate her weakness to weather, so Heatran, Chandelure, and Gastrodon make great partners. Heatran and Chandelure can handle sun and hail, while Gastrodon benefits from rain and tanks common attacks from sand teams.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>SolarBeam becomes usable in sun, and Weather Ball becomes usable in most weather. However, because weather inducers are common, the moves may become weakened. Sleep Powder is a good support move, but Amoonguss and Breloom are better sleep inducers than Roserade. If Guts sweepers are a problem for your team, Worry Seed can severely cripple them, but due to Roserade's frailty, smacking them with a STAB Leaf Storm deals with them more effectively. A Choice Scarf set with Shadow Ball or Weather Ball over Protect can be considered if you want the extra Speed. If Roserade's teammates cover the Pokemon that Hidden Power Ice or Fire would hit, Hidden Power Ground can be used to increase coverage, but Hidden Power Ice and Fire are generally more useful.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hail teams are troublesome to Roserade, as a STAB Blizzard will easily OHKO her. If Roserade is not carrying Shadow Ball, Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Musharna wall her and retaliate with a super effective Psychic. Roserade can't do a thing against Fire-types, and Heatran will be able to completely shut her down. Heat Wave from opposing sun teams can also cause trouble. The choice of a certain Hidden Power will determine which Pokemon will wall Roserade. If Hidden Power Fire is chosen, Dragon-types wall Roserade, and if you choose Hidden Power Ice, Steel-types wall her.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Roserade receives Technician from the Dream World. Technician would be more useful in VGC than Roserade's other two abilities, but Roserade does not possess a good enough movepool to effectively utilize it. With Technician, Roserade's STAB Magical Leaf would get boosted, as well as Hidden Power if you tweak the IVs properly. Sadly, outside of those two moves, Roserade doesn't receive anything noteworthy that would be boosted by Technician.</p>
