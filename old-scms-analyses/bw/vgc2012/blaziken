[Overview]

<p>With the addition of Dream World, Blaziken received an excellent ability in Speed Boost, which turns it into a potent offensive threat. Its amazing offensive typing makes it a great choice to lead with; just watch out for the common rain teams in the VGC 2012 metagame. However, Blaziken works best with sun support, as it can wreak havoc with its sun-boosted Fire-type STAB. With weather teams being so common in this metagame, Blaziken's dual STABs allow it to hit hail and sandstorm starters as well as bulky Steel-types, such as Bronzong and Metagross, for super effective damage, paving the way for its teammates to set up weather of their own and sweep.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The initial goal is to use Protect on turn one, which provides a free turn for Blaziken's Speed Boost ability to activate, allowing it to outspeed a large number of threats. Flare Blitz is Blaziken's strongest STAB, and dents hail teams and Fire-weak Pokemon such as Metagross and Abomasnow. Hi Jump Kick can be used for secondary STAB, but because many Pokemon in the VGC metagame carry Protect, Sky Uppercut is preferred for its reliability. Rock Slide and Shadow Claw provide extra coverage; the former hits Fire- and Flying-types for super effective damage, while the latter covers Ghost-types. However, Rock Slide is generally the better option because it hits both opposing Pokemon simultaneously, and has a nifty flinch rate as well.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly because Speed Boost increases Blaziken's Speed, reducing the need to use a positive Speed nature. Blaziken can also OHKO Abomasnow and Tyranitar that do not carry a Chople Berry, two very common Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame. If you wish to use a mixed set, an alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 48 SpA / 208 Spe can be used with Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Electric; Hidden Power Ice can 2HKO Garchomp even if it holds Yache Berry, while Hidden Power Electric can 2HKO Wacan Berry Gyarados.</p>

<p>Ninetales is certainly one of the best teammates Blaziken could ask for, as it has the ability to summon permanent sun. A max Attack, sun-boosted Flare Blitz can OHKO or 2HKO almost every Pokemon in the metagame, including those that resist it. As Blaziken has a lot of trouble with rain teams, Ferrothorn makes an excellent teammate; it can take all the Water-type attacks aimed at Blaziken and retaliate with a powerful STAB Power Whip. Sunny Day users are also good teammates. Priority support is very helpful as well; Weavile is a good teammate in this case.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Blaziken has a few other options to consider. A special set with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is a viable option. Choice Band is an item to consider if you feel Blaziken's Attack isn't high enough, but it is not nearly as good as Life Orb. Fire Gem can be used to fire off a single powerful Flare Blitz which can OHKO almost everything that does not resist it, if used in the sun. Swords Dance can surprise opponents expecting Protect on turn 1; Blaziken will be at +2 Attack and +1 Speed at the end of the turn. Work Up is another set-up move to consider, as it works well on a mixed set. Brave Bird is an option for additional coverage, but the recoil damage can bring Blaziken down fast. Lastly, Sunny Day can be used to activate the sun, but Ninetales does this job better.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blaziken doesn't have many counters if it's used in the sun because sun-boosted Flare Blitz will 2HKO almost all Pokemon in the tier, including Pokemon that resist it. Bulky Water-types can take a hit in the rain easily and OHKO back with their STAB moves. Rain teams in general check Blaziken very well. When not used in the sun, Blaziken has a few hard counters such as Jellicent and Gliscor; they can take any of its attacks and proceed to KO Blaziken with a super effective move. Trick Room users, such as Reuniclus, take down Blaziken with ease, as they can use its high Speed to their advantage and KO it with a powerful move.</p>
