[Overview]

<p>Normally, Gastrodon would be seen as a fairly average Pokemon. It doesn't have great stats, but what sets Gastrodon apart from other Pokemon like it is its access to Storm Drain. With this fantastic ability, Gastrodon has an immunity to Surf and Water Spout. Its secondary Ground-type allows it to function in a sandstorm as well, taking no residual damage each turn. Its low Speed stat means it can be used under Trick Room, making Gastrodon extremely versatile. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set capitalizes on Gastrodon's bulkiness and also provides some offensive capabilities with Storm Drain. The Special Attack boost gives Gastrodon some offensive power, while still allowing for an EV investment in the defenses. Surf allows Gastrodon to utilize its best STAB spread move, but the fact that it hits your other Pokemon on the field might make you wary of it. If you are worried about hitting your own Pokemon at a crucial time, Muddy Water is an excellent replacement option. Muddy Water has a 30% chance to lower the opposing Pokemon's accuracy, which could be enough reason to use it despite its 85% accuracy. Ice Beam is recommended because of its 100% accuracy and the fact that it isn't blocked by Wide Guard. Icy Wind is another option, because it hits both opposing Pokemon and can lower their Speed, which could be an asset in the battle. Earth Power allows Gastrodon to utilize its other STAB, and hits Steel-types for more damage. It also hits harder if Gastrodon is forced to play in the sun. Toxic can be used if you feel that hitting Steel-types is unnecessary, as it will take its toll on the opposing Pokemon. Recover is useful on Gastrodon because it takes hits well and can just get HP back rather than using Protect and being dead weight for a turn. </p>

<p>This set is Gastrodon's best because of its versatility. It works exceptionally well under the rain, and works well in Hail, Sand, and is able to survive in Sun. With plenty of coverage moves, Gastrodon is able to take on most physical attackers in the metagame. Rindo Berry is used in order to survive Grass-type moves such as Power Whip, SolarBeam, Wood Hammer, Grass Knot, and Energy Ball, but Sitrus Berry is another option if you're not worried about those moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Gastrodon's other abilities aren't nearly as potent as Storm Drain. Sticky Hold doesn't have much use in doubles, as Trick and Knock Off aren't seen all that often. Sand Force also doesn't benefit Gastrodon much because its offensive stats aren't high enough to merit the use of it over Storm Drain. Gastrodon could also use the same set but with a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD for a specially bulky set. A Calm nature would be more optimal with that spread. Another more offensive spread with a 252 SpA EV investment is able to KO Terrakion with a +1 Muddy Water, and Thundurus with a +1 Ice Beam. With this, it can also OHKO 252 HP Metagross with a +1 Earth Power. Gastrodon can also be given a speed IV of 0 and used under Trick Room. Gastrodon's movepool is fairly shallow, although it has enough for good coverage and support. Gastrodon has great use in VGC 2012 because of its resistances to Heat Wave, Discharge, Surf, Water Spout, and Rock Slide. </p>

<p>A good partner for Gastrodon is Politoed, which can set up rain and use Surf to activate Storm Drain. Pokemon with Water Absorb are also good partners, as it is mutually beneficial to both Pokemon. Abomasnow can be a good partner as well, because its STAB Blizzard hurts Grass-types that threaten Gastrodon. Electric-types such Zapdos, Thundurus, and the Rotom formes are also very good partners, because they can launch off Discharge without fear of hurting their own ally. </p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gastrodon can also make use of a few other support moves. It has access to Rain Dance, which can be useful for surprising your opponent, as most people expect to see auto-weather rather than individual moves. Scald can also be used, but it only hits one target. Gastrodon may also make use of Yawn, which forces your opponent into a tough position of either choosing to switch or choosing to let their Pokemon fall asleep. With no sleep clause in VGC, this can be a very useful tool. Gastrodon can also make use of Blizzard if used on a hail team or if you're feeling lucky with its accuracy. Gastrodon can also utilize Hidden Power Fire to hit Grass-types that counter it, such as Abomasnow and Ferrothorn. Double Team is another option, as its bulk allows it to stick around for a few turns, making it a threat with +1 evasion. Stockpile is another option worth exploring, as it allows Gastrodon to become even bulkier with its +1 boost to Defense and Special Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Abomasnow and Ferrothorn are great examples of counters for Gastrodon. They shrug off Gastrodon's STAB moves and are able to hit it back with their own STAB Grass-type attacks. Gastrodon is also worn down over time by many hits from the opposition. Although it is bulky, it isn't able to hit very hard without Storm Drain boosts, so it ends up just getting worn down with proper playing from the opponent.</p>
