[Overview]

<p>Zebstrika has an impressive base 116 Speed, but its other stats fall a bit short, and it has a shallow movepool. One thing Zebstrika can do well, nonetheless, is make use of Lightningrod. By having a partner use Discharge to boost Zebstrika's Special Attack—while also dealing damage to the opposition—Zebstrika can quickly become a destructive force, despite its low base Special Attack. Lightningrod's added benefit of stopping Thunder Wave means that it isn't easy to slow this zebra down once it hits its stride.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thunderbolt is Zebstrika's main offensive move. After one Lightningrod boost, Zebstrika's Thunderbolt hits a bit harder than that of Zapdos. Overheat provides Zebstrika with coverage on Grass-type Pokemon, namely Amoonguss; a boosted Overheat will OHKO all but the most specially defensive of Amoonguss. Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass moves that provide for extra coverage. The former enables Zebstrika to take on Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios and Garchomp, while the latter grants Zebstrika a harder hit on Ground- and Water-type Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves, such as Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Seaking. Finally, Protect allows Zebstrika to block incoming attacks, and is a staple move in the VGC metagame. This is particularly useful on Zebstrika as the opponents will be pressured to take it out after it manages to get a few Special Attack boosts.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Zebstrika's Speed and Special Attack, while a Life Orb improves Zebstrika's damage output. A Focus Sash can be used instead to guarantee that Zebstrika survives an attack.<p>

<p>Zebstrika isn't much of a threat without a partner to boost it with Discharge. Unfortunately, Zebstrika's Speed works against it a bit here as it needs a faster partner to power it up before it attacks, thus limiting the number of Pokemon that are compatible with Zebstrika. Jolteon and Electrode are two Electric-types that are naturally speedier than Zebstrika. Raikou can also work if Zebstrika limits itself to 236 Speed EVs. Lastly, Thundurus can work as a partner if Zebstrika runs 204 Speed EVs, but this will cause Zebstrika to Speed tie with Latios, so it isn't recommended. More options are open for the Discharge partner if it can run a Choice Scarf. A Choice Scarf would allow Rotom-A, Thundurus, and Zapdos to move before Zebstrika and boost it with Discharge.</p>

<p>While Zebstrika must be paired with a Discharge user to pose an offensive threat, it can still provide great support with Lightningrod. Water-type Pokemon such as Politoed and Gyarados, who don't take too kindly to Electric-type moves, greatly appreciate Lightningrod taking away the threat of a super effective attack. In addition to this, as Lightningrod absorbs Thunder Wave, Zebstrika's presence assures that faster Pokemon such as Latios and Terrakion, as well as Choice Scarf users, such as Abomasnow, Chandelure, and Rotom-A, can maintain their Speed over the opponents. Keep in mind, though, that Lightningrod will redirect an ally's Electric-type moves. Therefore, while the opponent can't use Thunder Wave against your team, Zebstrika's partner will not be able to use any Electric-type move either, except for Discharge.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>As stated earlier, Zebstrika's movepool is quite limited. Discharge provides Zebstrika with a spread move, but it will damage and possibly even paralyze Zebstrika's own ally, so it can be tricky to use. Thunder can be useful if Zebstrika is used on a rain team. Access to Me First grants Zebstrika a few interesting options, such as a boosted Draco Meteor against Latios, but it is a bit too situational. Thunder Wave and Light Screen provide Zebstrika with a few options as a support Pokemon, allowing it to do something even if it doesn't manage to get any Lightningrod boosts.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Although Zebstrika is rather frail, it typically has enough durability to take one neutral attack; to illustrate, it takes roughly a neutral 120 Base Power STAB move to OHKO Zebstrika. Choice Scarf Garchomp can easily handle Zebstrika, as it can switch in on Thunderbolt or Overheat, outspeed, and KO with Earthquake. Gastrodon, Lanturn, and Seaking can wall Zebstrika fairly easily if Zebstrika does not run Hidden Power Grass. Latias and Latios can take a +1 Hidden Power Ice and KO back with Draco Meteor, but they will run into trouble if Zebstrika has gained more than one Special Attack boost. Dark Gem or Life Orb Bisharp can OHKO Zebstrika with Sucker Punch, but will have trouble switching in safely. Lastly, Trick Room kills any hopes that Zebstrika has of attempting a sweep, as its high Speed will hinder it.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Zebstrika will get Sap Sipper as an ability when it is released. While an immunity to Grass-type moves can be interesting, Zebstrika's physical movepool is extremely lacking, making Sap Sipper a poor choice over Lightningrod.</p>
