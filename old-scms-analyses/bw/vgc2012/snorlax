[Overview]

<p>Snorlax instantly appeals as a powerful defensive Pokemon, boasting 160 / 65 / 110 defenses. However, a weakness to Fighting and low physical bulk leave Snorlax easy prey to the common Fighting-type attacks in VGC. Do not fear, though; Snorlax has access to many hard-hitting physical moves and a useful ability in Thick Fat. Snorlax also has an extremely low base 30 Speed; while this might seem to be a terrible weakness, it can be taken advantage of through Trick Room. Remember to play to Snorlax's strengths, and you will find it tearing up your opponents in no time.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is intended for use under Trick Room, where Snorlax can outspeed and tear through most frail opponents. Return is one of Snorlax's strongest STABs, while Earthquake deals solid damage to Steel-types that resist Return. However, as it is also a spread move, be careful not to hurt teammates when using it. Crunch helps Snorlax defeat common Ghost- and Psychic-type threats such as Cresselia and Jellicent, who, thanks to access to Trick Room, tend to be nightmares for any Trick Room team. Fire Punch can be useful against hail teams, and helps Snorlax defeat opponents that resist or are immune to its other attacks, such as Bronzong. Protect is used in the fourth slot as a multipurpose move; it can allow Snorlax to stall to some extent, aid against Fake Out users, and scout.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The item here comes down to personal preference; however, here are some useful calculations, showing common instances where Chople Berry is useful with the given EV spread:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>252 Atk Hitmontop Close Combat 49% - 58%</li>
<li>252 Atk Fighting Gem Hitmontop Close Combat 74% - 87%</li>
<li>252 Atk Terrakion Close Combat 55% - 65%</li>
<li>252 Atk Fighting Gem Terrakion Close Combat 83% - 98%</li>
</ul>

<p>Chople Berry is definitely an excellent choice, letting Snorlax survive almost anything Terrakion can throw at it. The given EVs are fairly straightforward: maximum Attack investment lets Snorlax hit as hard as possible, and the rest go into optimizing its bulk. Snorlax's HP stat is large and needs little investment, the Defense EVs and the Chople Berry help Snorlax take some Fighting-type attacks, while the Special Defense EVs cushion special blows, such as a Thunderbolt from Zapdos or Thundurus. A Brave nature maximizes Snorlax's Attack stat while lowering its Speed; in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs, Snorlax becomes as fast in Trick Room as possible. Snorlax's ability also comes down to preference. Thick Fat gives Snorlax resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, such as Heat Wave and Blizzard, whilst Immunity stops Snorlax from becoming poisoned. Thick Fat is usually the superior option, but one must still watch out for the occasional burn or freeze.</p>

<p>Pokemon with the Telepathy ability, such as Musharna, make decent partners for Snorlax, as they allow it to fire off moves such as Earthquake and Selfdestruct without worry of hurting its partner. In fact, Psychic-type Pokemon in general make excellent partners for Snorlax: Reuniclus, Musharna, and Cresselia can all set up Trick Room, which is a must for it to function properly, as well as take out annoying Fighting-types with super effective STAB attacks. Additionally, Cresselia and Musharna can provide Helping Hand support for Snorlax, while Reuniclus can help Snorlax take down the opponent's team once Trick Room is up. While Ghost-type Pokemon are able to switch in on Fighting-type moves that could potentially KO Snorlax, most Ghost-types that can provide Helping Hand + Trick Room support have a tough time taking out Fighting-types, making Psychic-types better suited for this role. Follow Me and Rage Powder users are nice teammates to have too, as they can absorb strong Fighting-type blows that could potentially KO Snorlax. Capable users of these moves include Amoonguss, Parasect, and Togekiss.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Superpower is a solid option for scoring some KOs against most Steel- and Rock-types, as well as opposing Snorlax that don't invest heavily in Defense. Sitrus Berry could be a viable item for gaining instant recovery after taking some hits or getting HP back after Belly Drum. Although setting up in VGC can be dangerous, if you can predict your opponent double Protecting to stall out Trick Room, Snorlax can use Belly Drum and go in for a KO on the next turn. Selfdestruct is a very powerful STAB move, and when boosted by a Normal Gem, it will almost always guarantee a KO on Pokemon that don't resist it, have an immunity to it, or use Protect. Body Slam can be used as a good STAB in place of Return, and the possibility of paralysis can be useful. Chesto Berry can be used with Rest, letting Snorlax regain full health mid-game and survive longer.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fighting-types are among the most common Pokemon in VGC 2012. This can be a huge problem for Snorlax, as they stop its sweep short and outright destroy it with their super effective STAB moves. Chople Berry Tyranitar is a threat as well, especially if it carries Low Kick or Superpower, as the best Snorlax can throw at it is Superpower. Metagross is also often problematic, even with Earthquake and Trick Room up.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Snorlax gets Gluttony from the Dream World. When this ability is released, it probably won't do much to help Snorlax until the pinch berries are released. Even then, it isn't very good.</p>
