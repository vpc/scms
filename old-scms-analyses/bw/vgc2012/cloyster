[Overview]

<p>Boasting amazing physical bulk and respectable Attack and Speed stats, as well as good offensive typing and type coverage, Cloyster is a threat to prepare for in the VGC 2012 metagame. While stat-boosting moves are often frowned upon in such a fast-paced metagame, Cloyster is one of the few Pokemon that can effectively boost and sweep the opponent's team with proper team support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although boosting moves are typically frowned upon, Cloyster is one of the few Pokemon that can consistently set up and sweep the opponent's team with ease. After a Shell Smash, Cloyster is able to KO almost every Pokemon in the VGC 2012 metagame with Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, which always hit five times due to Skill Link, allowing Cloyster to threaten Pokemon such as Zapdos, Latios, and Garchomp. Multi-hit moves are also useful for overriding type-resist Berries and KOing the holder. Hidden Power Fire ensures Cloyster is not walled by Scizor, but if Cloyster is hit down to its Focus Sash, priority Bullet Punch will KO it. While getting the KO on Scizor is important for Cloyster, Protect is a decent alternative, allowing Cloyster to shield itself from an attack while its teammate KOes the threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash is essential if Cloyster wants to use Shell Smash. With the given EVs and the Lonely nature, Cloyster after a Shell Smash hits 242 Speed, just shy of Speed tying Ludicolo in rain due to Hidden Power. If outpacing Ludicolo and other Pokemon is important, a Hasty nature can be used; however, the drop in power is noticeable. After a Shell Smash, Cloyster can utilize STAB moves such as Hydro Pump and Shell Razor to hit other Pokemon for super effective damage. Hydro Pump and Shell Razor hit harder against Pokemon that are only 2x weak to Fire-type moves. Pokemon that can use Rage Powder or Follow Me, such as Amoonguss, make good teammates as they draw in Fake Outs and Thunderbolts that would otherwise KO Cloyster. A partner with Wide Guard, such as Hitmontop, blocks Cloyster from Discharges and Rock Slides from common threats. A Fake Out partner helps Cloyster get the Shell Smash off, ensuring that Cloyster isn't KOed that turn.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>There isn't anything about Cloyster that screams "Choice Scarf user", especially with its middling Speed and Attack stats. To demonstrate how effective this set is, take a closer look at Icicle Spear. Cloyster's Skill Link essentially turns it into an Ice-type Close Combat with no negative repercussions, as well as the ability to bypass Focus Sash and Yache Berry. Although a base 95 Attack stat doesn't sound too attractive on paper, that's still on par with the likes of Hitmontop. Add that to the fact that many common Pokemon take at least neutral damage from Ice-type attacks, you have yourself a really potent threat on your hands!</p>

<p>Icicle Spear is the star of the show. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Cloyster can outspeed and OHKO 252/0 Zapdos, Yache Berry Garchomp, Latios, Thundurus, Tornadus, and many more. It's absolutely hilarious to see threats such as Zapdos have their Sitrus Berry activate midway through the attack, only to have them faint after all five hits. Rock Blast provides additional coverage and deals with any Fire-types that stand in your way. Razor Shell will be seldom used, but it provides nice secondary STAB and takes a good chunk off the troublesome Terrakion. Explosion is primarily a filler, but it might come in handy once in a blue moon. You're using a Choice Scarf Cloyster anyway, so a second surprise in the form of Explosion doesn't hurt anyone.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread allows Cloyster to hit a magical Speed stat of 180 with a Choice Scarf, just barely enough to outpace positive-natured base 111 Speed Pokemon. From there, the rest is invested into Attack for maximum firepower. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP for some additional bulk. A Naughty nature can be used with a special attack in the fourth slot, but it probably won't be seeing much use. If you choose to run a Naughty nature, make sure you move the HP EVs into Special Attack. Prominent special options include Hidden Power Fire, Surf, Hydro Pump, Blizzard, and Ice Beam. For a few wacky hijinks, Protect is an option in the last slot. Using Protect and immediately switching out on the next turn might fool your opponent into thinking you're not using a Choice Scarf at all. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature is also an option that allows Cloyster to outrun maximum Speed base 115 Pokemon, as well as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Choice Scarf Abomasnow. Be warned that the power difference is noticeable, so give it some thought first.</p>

<p>As for teammates, Cloyster can't handle multiple opponents at once, so Follow Me, Rage Powder, or Fake Out support is greatly appreciated. Not only does Hitmontop make a stellar Fake Out user, but it can lower the power of opposing Rock Slides with Intimidate or block Rock Slide, or any other spread attack, with Wide Guard, as well as smack Steel-types that resist Icicle Spear with Close Combat. Amoonguss can redirect Fighting-, Grass-, or Electric-type attacks aimed at Cloyster with Rage Powder, sponge Fake Out from slower opponents, and even put your opponent to sleep with Spore, giving Cloyster plenty of time to attack. Not only is Volcarona a good user of Rage Powder as it resists the Fighting- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Cloyster, but it also outspeeds the majority of Fake Out users, guaranteeing that Cloyster will be free to attack (burning Fake Out users with Volcarona's Flame Body is also hysterical). Be cautious if using Volcarona and Cloyster together, as two Pokemon weak to Rock Slide isn't the best idea. Pokemon that love having Garchomp and Zapdos out of the way are also great teammates to consider. Metagross springs to mind as a good candidate—it loves firing off Meteor Mash and Earthquake without the ever-annoying Zapdos in the way.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>A White Herb can be used to nullify the defensive drops from using Shell Smash, but a Focus Sash guarantees that Cloyster can get the Shell Smash off. Explosion can be used once Cloyster is brought down to its Focus Sash, but due to the abundance of Protect, it isn't as effective as its other moves. Cloyster receives a good special movepool, but a specially based set won't be able to take advantage of Skill Link. Ice Shard can be used if priority is desired, but after a Shell Smash, Cloyster is fast enough to outpace most Pokemon. Scizor is the only notable Pokemon priority would hit, and the attack would be shrugged off.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Because there is no Pokemon that receives both Follow Me / Rage Powder and Wide Guard, Cloyster can be KOed by priority moves such as Bullet Punch and double-targeting moves such as Rock Slide. If Cloyster isn't packing Hidden Power Fire, several Pokemon become easy checks. Scizor and Metagross resist both of Cloyster's attacking moves and can KO with priority or Meteor Mash.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Cloyster receives Overcoat from Dream World, which would only protect it from sand and is useless as it makes Cloyster sacrifice Skill Link, which is what allows it to become a deadly sweeper with Rock Blast and Icicle Spear.</p>
