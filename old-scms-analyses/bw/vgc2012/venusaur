[Overview]

<p>Out of all the Chlorophyll users, Venusaur is perhaps the most balanced. Neither fast and frail, nor bulky with a great support movepool, it has a little bit of everything. This has its benefits, but with benefits come downsides. Trying to occupy the roles of two very different types of Pokemon, Venusaur often falls short of all its goals. Despite this, proper support can open up new doors for Venusaur, and it can become a great Pokemon to utilize on a sun team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In sun, Venusaur's ability, Chlorophyll, doubles its Speed, instantly allowing it to outpace all other unboosted Pokemon. This makes for an insanely fast Sleep Powder, and the lack of Sleep Clause in VGC allows Venusaur to quickly incapacitate several remaining foes. In addition to providing a solid STAB move, Energy Ball hits auto-weather Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Politoed, for super effective damage, something a sun team always needs. If one doesn't fear other weather, SolarBeam is a powerful STAB option while in sun, hitting for 120 Base Power without having to charge. However, one must be aware of the numerous ways SolarBeam can be neutered, as the four other weather starters love to switch in and leave Venusaur with a two-turn charging move that has severely reduced effectiveness. Hidden Power Ice gives Venusaur a way to hit the Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon that take little damage from its STAB move. Sludge Bomb, however, provides a secondary STAB move that has a higher Base Power than Energy Ball, and can afflict the opponent with the poison condition. Protect is arguably the best move in doubles, shielding Venusaur from all assaults for a turn, as well as giving its partner time to eliminate a threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Venusaur's attacking power leaves something to be desired, so a Life Orb is used to boost the damage output of all its attacks. If a Life Orb is not available, a Yache Berry makes for a suitable alternative, as it could allow Venusaur to survive a Blizzard it might otherwise not. A Modest nature and 252 Special Attack EVs let Venusaur hit as hard as possible, and 252 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed nearly everything under sun. Chandelure and Heatran pose a threat to Venusaur, making Hidden Power Ground a viable option to take care of these Pokemon.</p>

<p>Due to Venusaur's dependence on sun, a Pokemon to set it up is greatly appreciated. Ninetales is the premier Pokemon to provide this, with its ability, Drought, instantly bringing eternal sun to the field. Venusaur helps Ninetales by taking on the dangerous Ground-types that want to smack it with a super effective Earthquake.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Petal Dance might seem like an attractive option for its sheer power, but it is unreliable as it hits a random opponent and confuses Venusaur after a few turns. Giga Drain might seem inviting for the recovery it provides, and it would be if it were not incompatible with Chlorophyll, so Venusaur is best relying on the average Energy Ball. Those looking for healing might see Synthesis as an option; however, Venusaur is better off attacking than trying to heal, and Synthesis is inconsistent at best. A physical set is somewhat viable, utilizing Seed Bomb and Earthquake to hit Venusaur's usual counters for super effective damage, but the low damage output will often turn one off. Substitute can be utilized along with Sleep Powder for a deadly combo, which allows Venusaur to keep its opponents asleep and render them unable to take it out immediately.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fire-types such as Chandelure and Heatran wall Venusaur to no end, taking little from its attacks and hitting back with super effective Fire-type moves. Ironically, the condition that suits Venusaur the best is also its worst enemy. Sun boosts Fire-type moves by 50%, allowing such attacks to OHKO Venusaur with no trouble. Ice-types threaten Venusaur as well; Abomasnow in particular neuters Venusaur's Speed with hail and threatens a KO with a super effective Blizzard. Venusaur's weakness to Flying allows Pokemon such as Tornadus and Togekiss to have a field day against it, as they can dish out massive damage to Venusaur with their STAB moves.</p>
