[Overview]

<p>Amoonguss's base stats and moveset allow it to pull off its supportive role to the fullest. It's one of the few Pokemon in the game to have access to Spore, which is great for removing a threatening Pokemon by putting it to sleep. Its abysmal Speed makes it a force to be reckoned with under Trick Room; moreover, it receives Rage Powder, which allows its partner to set up Trick Room safely. All of Amoonguss's advantages makes it a perfect support Pokemon in doubles, and it should never be overlooked.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set brings out Amoonguss's full potential as a team player and a defensive Pokemon. Spore is a staple on Amoonguss, as it allows Amoonguss to instantly put a threatening foe to sleep, rendering it helpless for several turns. Rage Powder, which redirects any attack aimed at Amoonguss's partner back to itself, is another non-negotiable move, as it is especially helpful for allowing Amoonguss's teammate to set up safely. Giga Drain is Amoonguss's STAB move of choice; not only does it prevent Amoonguss from becoming dead weight if Taunted, it also ensures that Amoonguss's health is as high as possible. Protect is generally a useful move in doubles, as it allows Amoonguss to avoid a possible attack from either opponent. Sludge Bomb is a stronger STAB move and stops Amoonguss from being walled by opposing Grass-types and Pokemon with the Sap Sipper ability. Sitrus Berry capitalizes on Amoonguss's bulk, restoring Amoongus's health when it drops below half. Mental Herb prevents Taunt's effects for one turn and guarantees that Amoonguss will pull off one Spore.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum HP and Special Defense is the best spread, allowing Amoonguss to stay alive for as long as possible. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD and a Bold nature works if your team would instead prefer insurance against Fighting-type attacks. Such a spread would also give Amoonguss a better chance of surviving Zen Headbutt from Metagross and Gallade so it can put them to sleep. A Sassy nature allows Amoonguss to be as slow as possible should it be used on a Trick Room team, as it makes Amoonguss as fast as possible under Trick Room. Coba Berry and Occa Berry reduce the damage Amoonguss takes from powerful Flying- and Fire-type attacks, respectively. Black Sludge and Leftovers give Amoonguss gradual HP recovery, but due to the fast-paced nature of doubles play, the slow health recovery is not that beneficial. 68 Speed EVs and a neutral Speed nature allow Amoonguss to outpace Quiet Abomasnow and put it to sleep or nail it with Sludge Bomb. Rock-types, such as Tyranitar and Rhyperior, appreciate having Amoonguss as a partner, because it can divert Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks aimed at them. In return, they can deal with most Fire- and Flying-types that plague Amoonguss. Amoonguss also works well with Trick Room users, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Jellicent, as it resists Electric- and Grass-type moves aimed at those three. Lastly, Amoonguss works extremely well on Drizzle teams as the rain reduces damage it takes from Fire-type attacks, and it can use Rage Powder to redirect Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Politoed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stun Spore can be used alongside Spore for double status, but it is usually an inferior choice considering its shaky accuracy. Toxic shuts down most other support Pokemon, but it's usually an inferior option because Amoonguss is usually better off shutting down it's opponents completely with Spore. Synthesis instantly regains a significant portion of Amoonguss's health, but with the prevalence of rain, sandstorm, and hail, it is discouraged. Hidden Power Ice is a possible options over Protect as it hits Flying- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, such as Zapdos and Latios.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If Amoonguss is lacking Mental Herb, Taunt shuts it down completely by preventing it from using Spore and Rage Powder. Amoonguss is threatened by most users of Flying Gem Acrobatics, and must carry a Coba Berry to avoid being OHKOed. Powerful Fire-types, such as Chandelure, Infernape, and Heatran, can deal a lot of damage to Amoonguss with their STAB attacks, but this can be remedied by providing Amoonguss with rain support. Physical Psychic-types, such as Metagross and Gallade, can hurt Amoonguss badly with Zen Headbutt, and can even Trick it a Choice item to shut it down. Pokemon with the Sap Sipper ability can also be problematic as they are unaffected by Spore and Giga Drain, receiving an Attack boost when hit by them.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Amoonguss can't make much use of its Dream World ability, Regenerator, in doubles; Regenerator is only useful if the user switches in and out a lot, which rarely happens in the doubles environment.</p>
