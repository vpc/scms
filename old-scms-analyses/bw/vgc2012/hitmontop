[Overview]
<p>Hitmontop burst onto the scene in VGC 2010, forming one half of the famed "TopOgre" combo. While its partner in crime, Kyogre, may be banned this year, Hitmontop is a great Pokemon in its own right. Possessing two amazing abilities, a movepool tailored to its stats, and an excellent typing that provides it with a great Fighting-type STAB, Hitmontop is a staple on any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Game Freak saw fit to bless Hitmontop with not one, but two great abilities. With Intimidate, Hitmontop can neuter opponents utilizing physical moves, supporting its team and benefiting itself as well. Fake Out is a great utility move for breaking Focus Sashes and forcing Protects on the first turn. Close Combat allows Hitmontop to keep its damage output high even without the Technician boost, while at the cost of its defenses being lowered. Some may find this uncomfortable, however, and utilizing Mach Punch alongside a Fighting Gem is a suitable alternative that provides priority. Sucker Punch is a necessity to deal with the ever-common Latios and Cresselia, both waiting to do massive damage with their STAB Psychic and resisting Hitmontop's STAB moves. Due to the support-oriented nature of this set, Wide Guard is utilized instead of Detect to protect Hitmontop's partners from the variety of spread moves that are commonplace in double battles. One may feel the need to add Detect for security, however, and this is a suitable alternative should another teammate already have access to Wide Guard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>A Fighting Gem is used alongside Close Combat or Mach Punch for a one-time powerful Fighting-type move. To keep Hitmontop in top condition, a Sitrus Berry can be used instead and helps greatly with Hitmontop's longevity. A third, unlisted option to consider is an Eject Button. With an Eject Button, both Intimidate and Fake Out are re-usable, allowing for more disruption. However, be warned that an untimely Eject Button activation can spell your doom if a faster opponent activates it before a crucial Close Combat. As with most support sets, maximum investment in HP keeps Hitmontop alive and kicking throughout the game, while 252 EVs are placed in Attack to allow it to hit hard with its attacks.</p>

<p>Weavile has excellent synergy with this set, as Hitmontop shields it from the common spread moves that threaten it in Heat Wave and Rock Slide while also decreasing the damage Fighting-type moves do to Weavile through Intimidate. Likewise, Weavile aids Hitmontop by eliminating the Flying- and Psychic-type threats which cause Hitmontop grief with their STAB attacks.</p>

<p>Technician boosts all moves that have a Base Power of 60 or less, allowing Hitmontop to utilize priority moves to the fullest. Fake Out prevents opponents from setting up and makes them a sitting duck for a turn; this gives Hitmontop's partner the opportunity to set up something of its own or KO the foe that poses a threat to Hitmontop. A STAB-, Technician-, and Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch deals out massive amounts of damage to almost everything it touches, and is the main drawing point for this set. Pokemon that resist Mach Punch, however, such as Latios and Zapdos, give Hitmontop problems, and Sucker Punch provides the perfect counter against these foes. As a priority Dark-type move, Sucker Punch is also the perfect solution to any Psychic-type threats that threaten Hitmontop with their powerful STAB attacks. Detect provides Hitmontop with a way to stay alive for an additional crucial turn, while its partner takes care of a threatening foe. Detect may be unnecessary, however, and in this case Wide Guard provides a suitable option. Spread moves such as Heat Wave and Rock Slide run rampant in doubles, and Wide Guard blocks these moves, keeping Hitmontop's teammates alive.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>A Life Orb boosts Hitmontop's already-powerful attacks even further, and Sucker Punch welcomes the rise in power, as it is not boosted by Technician. All of Hitmontop's attacks are priority-based moves and therefore, only a minimum amount of EVs are invested in Speed while maximum investment in HP and Attack secure Hitmontop's place on the field as a bulky attacker.</p>

<p>Hitmontop's skills as a powerful priority user are much in need, allowing it to fit on a variety of different teams. Trick Room teams benefit from the Fake Out support Hitmontop brings to the table, allowing Trick Room to be set up without hindrance. Likewise, Tailwind and goodstuff teams appreciate the extra time given by Hitmontop with Fake Out.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Aerial Ace is a viable option for hitting other Hitmontop, as well as Toxicroak and Shedinja, who give Hitmontop problems otherwise. With the Flying-types that threaten Hitmontop, a Coba Berry may be used to stay alive for another turn; however, Hitmontop has no real way of responding, and therefore, is better suited carrying a Life Orb. A set revolving around a Focus Sash, Endeavor, and Mach Punch could be used, but it is more of a gimmick than an actual set. Hitmontop also has access to Rock Slide, but there are far better Pokemon that receive this move, such as Terrakion and Garchomp. Feint is a nifty move, providing another Technician-boosted priority move that has the ability to break an opponent's Protect, and is worth consideration on the first set. Helping Hand can also work on the supportive set in place of Wide Guard or Detect. Of note is Dark Gem too, which gives Hitmontop a chance to OHKO Latios with Sucker Punch, as well as dealing more damage to Cresselia. Hitmontop also gets the ability of Steadfast, but is often useless for Hitmontop as it hardly ever gets flinched and it would miss out on previous generation tutor moves like Sucker Punch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Flying-types such as Tornadus and Thundurus take little damage from Hitmontop's assaults, and hit back hard with their own STAB moves. Psychic-types, Cresselia and Metagross in particular, make Hitmontop's life a living hell. Metagross completely ignores Intimidate with Clear Body and can OHKO with Zen Headbutt while Cresselia takes little from even a super effective Sucker Punch and destroys Hitmontop with Psychic. Latios too, can survive a Sucker Punch and fire off a STAB Psychic or Psyshock, OHKOing Hitmontop. With Intimidate and a Fighting-type resistance, Gyarados performs extremely well in countering Hitmontop.</p>
