[Overview]

<p>Sharpedo is as close to a "classic sweeper" as you can get. It has great base 120 Attack, base 95 Special Attack, and base 95 Speed. While that Speed stat is below the all-important base 100 threshold, Speed Boost means Speed is the least of Sharpedo's worries. The shark's dual STAB is not perfect, but Water / Dark coverage is still very good since only a few Pokemon in RU resist the combo. Outside of its STAB moves, one may notice Sharpedo has few coverage options—Earthquake, Hidden Power, and Ice Beam are the only other notable moves. However, Sharpedo has little room, and little need, for such moves. In the classic sweeper sense, unfortunately, Sharpedo has pathetic defenses and even resisted moves can cripple it. Furthermore, it has no way to boost its offensive stats, meaning even weak walls can stop and KO it. In any case, Sharpedo can still pose a huge threat as a late-game sweeper, and should not be neglected in that sense.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
 
<p>Sharpedo's flagship set is a mixed attacker capable of busting holes in almost any team. With Stealth Rock and Spikes in play, your opponent will be hard-pressed to stop this monster. Hydro Pump is Sharpedo's primary STAB, hitting hard and getting good neutral coverage. Crunch is a secondary STAB move that picks up key KOs on Slowking, Sigilyph, and Dusknoir. The third move can be a troublesome decision. Earthquake is the superior option to hit many more targets, including Qwilfish, Drapion, and Lanturn. Ice Beam, however, hits Tangrowth, one of the best counters to set, though it has little value otherwise. Protect is in the final moveslot to get that extra Speed boost right when you need it, and can also be used to scout for priority.</p>
 
[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
 
<p>The recommended EV spread has many purposes; one of these is to outspeed neutral Base 80s before a Speed Boost, and neutral Accelgor after a single Speed boost. The Attack investment is the minimum required to always get an OHKO on standard Slowking after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack to boost the power of Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Life Orb is a necessity, as Sharpedo wants to hit as hard as possible, and its paper-thin defenses make it susceptible to priority anyway.</p>
 
<p>Hidden Power Fire is an option over Protect to hit Ferroseed, another chief counter to this set. However, Protect is crucial when you need just a little more Speed to get the jump on certain threats. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Manectric and Galvantula can outspeed Sharpedo even after a Speed Boost and KO with their STAB moves. As such, a great partner for Sharpedo is Munchlax, as it can take all the special hits that are thrown at Sharpedo with little worry. Magneton and Slowking are also great partners, as the former traps Ferroseed, and the latter can dispatch it with Fire Blast. Slowking is also good to counter Hitmonchan, who always beats Sharpedo with Mach Punch. This set really appreciates entry hazard support; Roselia has good synergy and can lay down either Spikes or Toxic Spikes.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Protect
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Aqua Jet / Earthquake
item: Life Orb
ability: Speed Boost
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 64 Def / 68 SpD / 124 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is slightly different in that it focuses on Sharpedo's excellent Attack stat. Protect serves the same function: stall for Speed boosts and maybe waste field effect turns. Waterfall is the main STAB move, maiming the majority of threats and even 2HKOing physically defensive Gligar! Crunch provides another STAB move, and hits Slowking and Jynx, which would otherwise stop Sharpedo. The last slot is a toss up. Aqua Jet is useful for picking off weakened threats that have priority moves of their own, such as Hitmonchan. However, Earthquake, although it gives little outside of coverage, provides a way to deal with Qwilfish and Pokemon with a Water / Rock typing. Earthquake will also deal the most damage to enemy Sharpedo.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Sharpedo's Attack, which differentiates this set from the mixed sweeper. While it may be odd that EVs are invested in the defenses, Sharpedo's base 70 / 40 / 40 defenses means direct defense investment is more efficient statistically. Secondly, Sharpedo might be able to survive the odd resisted, neutral, or priority move with these EVs, though there is no exact intention. There are a few Pokemon that still give Sharpedo troubles, even with this EV spread. While Throh and Poliwrath can now be 2HKOed with Earthquake, physically defensive Quagsire, Alomomola, and Tangrowth will cause problems. The first two can be taken out with strong Grass- or Electric-type special attackers, such as Rotom-C and Galvantula. The latter will usually fall to neutral special attacks or Hidden Power Ice, which Rotom-C and Galvantula can provide. Kabutops is again a good partner since it can provide both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin support.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are a couple of other moves Sharpedo can make use of. Hidden Power Rock hits Fire-types more reliably than Hydro Pump, but provides less coverage and has less power. Substitute can be used in tandem with or over Protect; it eases prediction and stalls for multiple Speed boosts in a row. However, Sharpedo must set up against a slower opponent, which is difficult in a fast paced metagame. Choice items are an option (not Choice Scarf, obviously), but Floatzel pulls that role off better, as the otter has access to Switcheroo and is not as frail.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Pokemon that can survive Sharpedo's moves, especially those that resist its dual STAB such as Poliwrath and Ferroseed, can KO Sharpedo as long as the shark doesn't carry a super effective move. Hariyama, Quagsire, and Primeape are other Pokemon bulky enough to take a hit and destroy the shark. While Cofagrigus and Dusknoir are hit by Sharpedo's Dark-type moves super effectively, they have such high Defense that they can survive and retaliate. Cofagrigus's Mummy ability will also remove Sharpedo's Speed Boost, which could hinder a late-game sweep. Pokemon that can somehow manage to outspeed Sharpedo even after a Speed boost can revenge kill it. However, this is rare, since Protect usually ensures that Sharpedo will outspeed any Choice Scarf user. Priority moves not named Ice Shard and Bullet Punch will KO Sharpedo, as with Life Orb recoil, Sharpedo will never be at full health for very long.</p>
