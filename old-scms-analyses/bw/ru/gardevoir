[Overview]

<p>When DPP came along, the male-only counterpart to Gardevoir, Gallade, was introduced. The physically oriented Gallade quickly outclassed the feminine Gardevoir in every aspect: the former possesses the rare Psychic / Fighting typing while retaining the same great Special Defense stat as the latter. Though both are the last in their evolutionary line, Gardevoir and Gallade have never met in the same tier. After a short stay in ADV BL, Gardevoir fell from grace and never saw the glory of the OU tier, instead finding itself in the densely populated NU tier. Post-ADV, it was outclassed by other Psychic-types introduced in DPP and BW, such as Azelf and Reuniclus.</p>

<p>The Embrace Pokemon now finds itself sitting in the NU tier, but is viable in RU. As its elegance suggests, Gardevoir is very frail on the physical side, with a dismal base 68 HP and an even lower base 65 Defense stat. However, Gardevoir fares much better on the special side; it has an outstanding base 125 Special Attack, equal to that of Azelf, backed by a solid base 115 Special Defense. Thus, it can launch powerful special attacks and sponge them as well with nary a scratch to its beautiful gown. However, Gardevoir's pure Psychic typing means that it is in constant danger of becoming Pursuit bait in a tier infested with Dark-types, such as Absol and Spiritomb. As its Pokédex entries often say, Gardevoir will protect its trainer with its life. To express its loyalty, it will serve with its tremendously wide movepool that makes Smeargle drool. Despite its many shortcomings, Gardevoir still has a chance to shine brightly in the RU tier, not letting itself be engulfed in the world of Dark-types.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite having a poor defensive typing and an abysmal Defense stat, Gardevoir is well suited for a support role thanks to its excellent movepool. Will-O-Wisp allows Gardevoir to spread burns and abuse its tendency to attract physical attackers, punishing them for their naivety. As the burn status halves the burnt Pokemon's power, Gardevoir can take physical hits more easily from a burnt opponent; Gardevoir can even survive a Pursuit at full health from a burnt Choice Band Drapion. It can also stall for burn damage with Wish and Protect. Wish provides Gardevoir's allies with some support, although Gardevoir does not have a huge HP stat, which diminishes the usefulness of such a strategy. Alternatively, Gardevoir can use Heal Bell to act as a cleric, though it might have to rely on the inconsistent Pain Split to regain health, as Gardevoir often has difficulty receiving its own Wish without the use of Protect. Psychic is Gardevoir's best STAB option, and prevents it from being Taunt bait. This set not only aims to support the team, it can also wall several special attackers, who can't even scratch its white dress without a super effective move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread maximizes both Gardevoir's special bulk and the HP payload of its Wish. With this spread, most special attackers will have difficulty denting Gardevoir unless they pack super effective attacks, such as Shadow Ball and Signal Beam. It is recommended to invest Gardevoir's EVs into Special Defense instead of Defense, as even with maximum Defense EVs, Gardevoir has difficulty walling a considerable number of physical attackers. Thus, it is better for it to simply cripple physical attackers with a burn. Gardevoir is not restricted to spreading burns; it can also utilize other status moves, such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, though Will-O-Wisp is generally the better option. Thunder Wave is an excellent choice for supporting slow sweepers on the team, such as Choice Band Aggron, whereas Toxic enables Gardevoir to stall a myriad of Pokemon with the use of Wish and Protect. Thunderbolt can be used over Psychic as the sole attacking move, as it hits Absol—a common switch-in to Gardevoir—for good damage. Healing Wish is an interesting option to consider that gives a sweeper a second chance at doing its job after Gardevoir is done supporting the team. Synchronize can be used over Trace to deter status, and let Gardevoir act as a pseudo-status absorber. However it is rather counterproductive, as Gardevoir can cure itself with Heal Bell, and Trace is the better option in most cases. For example, Trace allows Gardevoir to switch in on the likes of Lightningrod Manectric for free if it uses an Electric-type move, and also gain a Special Attack boost. This would greatly aid Gardevoir in walling several special attackers.</p>

<p>Although Gardevoir has Will-O-Wisp to threaten physical attackers, there are several that it still has to be wary of. A single physical attack can swiftly eliminate this graceful Pokemon. Pursuit users are always a great concern for Gardevoir; Drapion, for example, checkmates Gardevoir if it can get in safely—Gardevoir has to burn Drapion on the switch to stand a chance of winning. Even with Will-O-Wisp to stunt most physical attackers, physical walls such as Steelix are still great teammates to the maiden in white dress as it can sponge Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-type moves attempting to finish Gardevoir off. Furthermore, the burn support that Gardevoir provides makes it easier for the physical walls to do their job. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Hariyama and Poliwrath, are good teammates; they can easily set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit and appreciate the Wish and Heal Bell support that Gardevoir provides.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Trick / Shadow Ball
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
ability: Trace
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A great movepool often means wide coverage, and this holds true for Gardevoir. With Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Focus Blast, Gardevoir hits everything in the tier bar Shedinja for at least neutral damage. With a Choice Scarf, Gardevoir makes a great revenge killer, albeit a graceful one. Coupled with decent base 80 Speed, Gardevoir is no slouch at outpacing many opponents when decked out with a Choice Scarf. With Trace, Gardevoir can act as a great counter to Pokemon dependent on weather to boost their Speed, such as Swift Swim Omastar. Because Trace copies the opponent's ability, Gardevoir can enjoy the benefits of the opponent's weather and put them to its own advantage. Choice Scarf Gardevoir outspeeds all Swift Swim and Chlorophyll abusers thanks to Trace, effectively countering them. On the other hand, Choice Specs Gardevoir is a force to be reckoned with. Hidden beneath its docile appearance is the nasty ability to absolutely wreck most Pokemon when holding Choice Specs. Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple walls, especially those dependent on Eviolite, such as Feroseed. However, a Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast will 2HKO Eviolite Ferroseed anyway. A timely Trick can also cripple set-up sweepers attempting to nab free boosts on Gardevoir. Shadow Ball is an alternative to Trick that has perfect coverage with Focus Blast.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Other interesting moves that Gardevoir can use on this set include Energy Ball, Grass Knot, and Signal Beam. However, the standard moves as given are generally the best options, unless you need Gardevoir to nab surprise KOs on certain threats. This Gardevoir set is bound to have problems with Pursuit users, unfortunately. Furthermore, locking Gardevoir into an inappropriate move too early can spell doom for this damsel in distress. Gardevoir is extremely prone to getting revenge killed, especially since Dark-types, such as Spiritomb and Drapion, run rampant in the RU tier.</p>

<p>This is where Team Preview comes into play; Team Preview is a huge asset to take advantage of when using this Gardevoir set, as you can use it to easily spot potential Gardevoir counters. Instead of blindly sending out Gardevoir and clicking Psychic, you can opt to immediately switch it out to scout for the opponent's switch-in and possibly predict the switch the next time Gardevoir is in play. A well-timed Focus Blast can easily decimate Steel-types such as Steelix and Aggron, while Thunderbolt will fry Absol and Crawdaunt. Dark-types of your own, such as Drapion and Zweilous, are good teammates; Fighting-types are also notable partners. They can easily set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit in the event of a misplay.</p>

<p>Entry hazard support is really great, as it allows Gardevoir to secure a few KOs. Steelix is not only a physical wall that has good synergy with Gardevoir, it can also set up Stealth Rock. Ferroseed is another notable teammate, as it resists two of the types that Gardevoir is weak to, has access to entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and can use Leech Seed to provide some recovery for Gardevoir. Wish support is deeply appreciated as Gardevoir has no method of healing itself; Wish can bring Gardevoir back from the brink of fainting, allowing it to wreak even more havoc and cause more frustration for the opponent as they try in vain to bring it down.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Memento
move 4: Psychic / Taunt / Will-O-Wisp
item: Light Clay
ability: Trace
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gardevoir has access to dual screens, so why not make use of it? At first glance, Gardevoir might seemed outclassed by other dual screens users, most notably Uxie, which boasts better bulk and access to U-turn. There seems to be no reason to use Gardevoir over Uxie! However, Gardevoir has access to Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, which might prove to be more useful than U-turn or Yawn in certain cases. With Taunt, Gardevoir can prevent the opposing Pokemon from setting up while Gardevoir executes its strategy, which takes a total of three turns. Additionally, Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, so Gardevoir is effectively taking a quarter of the usual damage when facing a burnt Pokemon behind Reflect. Psychic can be used if you would rather Gardevoir not be Taunt bait. Like Uxie, it has access to Memento, which Gardevoir can use to sacrifice itself after setting up the screens and allow its teammate to enter the field safely, and gain a free turn to set up. The main aim of this set is to support a sweeper, especially one that cannot be taken down easily while behind screens. As a rule of thumb, you should always set up Reflect first, as Gardevoir never fails to attract physical attackers. After that, it can proceed to burn the target with Will-O-Wisp or set up Light Screen, then pave way for the sweeper with Memento.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Light Clay is the compulsory item on this set to extend the screens' number of turns. The given EV spread maximizes Gardevoir's HP and Speed, allowing it to take hits better generally, and quickly set up screens or cripple the opposing Pokemon with an appropriate move. Healing Wish is an alternative to Memento that heals your sweeper completely. As this set's sole purpose is to make set up easier for the incoming sweeper, Gardevoir must be paired with a set up sweeper that appreciates the dual screens support. Rock Polish Aggron is a good example. It has extremely high Defense behind Reflect and great Special Defense under Light Screen, making it obscenely hard to take down. Furthermore, it has good synergy with Gardevoir—Aggron resists all of the attacks Gardevoir is weak to. Other examples include Shell Smash Omastar and Hariyama. Though Omastar might not have good type synergy with Gardevoir, it greatly appreciates dual screens support, as it makes Omastar harder to take down with priority moves—even Mach Punch. Hariyama can easily set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit, and is extremely difficult to KO thanks to the screens.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + 3 Attacks
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Focus Blast
item: Leftovers
ability: Trace
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With so many powerful Dark-types in RU just waiting to plunge Gardevoir into total darkness, the graceful Gardevoir must find a way to outdo them without plainly resorting to brute strength. The multitude of Dark-types can often corner Gardevoir with Pursuit, but this set aims to rectify that. By casting a Substitute, Gardevoir shields itself from a possible incoming Pursuit. Behind a Substitute, Gardevoir will put many physical attackers in an awkward position; physical attackers find themselves no longer able to neither check nor counter Gardevoir in a single move, and possibly have to choose between breaking the Substitute and getting KOed by an attack, or flee for their lives. With Substitute giving Gardevoir some protection from physical attacks, it can proceed to launch off a few powerful attacks of its own. Additionally, Substitute can possibly earn Gardevoir a couple of free turns as the opponent scrambles to find an appropriate counter. This set remedies Gardevoir's Pursuit weakness, and allows it to counter several threats it probably couldn't with other sets. For example, Absol will be put in a disadvantageous position when Gardevoir is behind a Substitute. No longer can Absol use Sucker Punch to KO Gardevoir; it now faces the possibility of being OHKOed by Focus Blast instead.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although this set allows Gardevoir to easily outmaneuver several threats, it can still be revenge killed if you're not careful. Substitute is mandatory to keep Gardevoir alive as long as possible and nab a few KOs. However, once the Substitute has faded, it signals the time for Gardevoir to fly gracefully back into its Poke Ball, elated that it has done what it usually could not. Without Substitute, this variant is no different from the other sets, and is as prone to being revenge killed as it normally would be. Keeping the Substitute up is the key to success for this set. Use this set with caution, as a simple misplay can prove to be costly. For example, if Gardevoir loses its Substitute while attempting to KO something when the opponent has a Pursuit user waiting in the wings, Gardevoir will still be revenge killed. With some sleight of hand, it is possible that Gardevoir can swiftly remove Pursuit users itself. Expert Belt can be used on this set for greater damage output; Life Orb should not be used as its recoil, coupled with the HP lost in creating Substitutes, can be overwhelming. Shadow Ball can be used over Thunderbolt for perfect coverage alongside Focus Blast, but Thunderbolt hits more Pokemon super effectively, most notably Murkrow and Crawdaunt. Encore is an option to use for easing set up, though Gardevoir appreciates the coverage it gets from its three main moves. Fighting-types are great teammates to maintain offensive pressure, even when Gardevoir's Substitute is broken and it has to switch out. Entry hazard support is much appreciated, as this set can force multiple switches thanks to Substitute. Ferroseed makes a good teammate because it can set up entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and has good synergy with Gardevoir. Wish support from Clefable can give Gardevoir another whirl and heal any HP lost from making Substitutes.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gardevoir's gown is so wide that it can easily fit many moves. Its wide movepool consists of many great supporting options as well as other offensive moves to consider. Encore can be used to help with set-up, though Gardevoir often prefers to have wide coverage. It can pull off a Substitute + Disable set to some success, nailing threats such as Choice Band Drapion, but the Substitute + 3 Attacks set already achieves this. As base 80 Speed isn't really impressive, Gardevoir can use a support or offensive Trick Room set. Gardevoir's wide variety of support moves also include Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Healing Wish, each with its own use in supporting the team. Other offensive options include Signal Beam, Energy Ball, Grass Knot, and Shadow Ball. Gardevoir can also support weather teams with Rain Dance and Sunny Day, though there are other Pokemon better suited for this role. Mean Look can be used to ensure that Gardevoir can use Memento on a specific target, benefiting the incoming Pokemon. Destiny Bond can also be used as another suicidal move, though it will probably cause a blind switch, which might be unfavorable for your switch-in. Gardevoir has access to boosting moves, such as Charge Beam and Calm Mind, but in a tier filled with Pokemon that can down Gardevoir in a single move, Gardevoir rarely finds a chance to set up, let alone sweep. Though Gardevoir has many options to choose from, the given sets are the best and have the most general utility.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dark-types and Pursuit users are possibly the best counters to Gardevoir. If they find an opportunity to switch in safely, Gardevoir is almost certainly cornered and defeated. Special walls, such as Clefable, can handle Gardevoir, but they must be wary if it carries Choice Specs. Gardevoir is extremely frail on the physical side, and that should be where to target when attempting to take it down. Any decently strong physical attack will easily cause Gardevoir to literally fall from grace. Ferroseed can use Gardevoir as setup fodder if it lacks Focus Blast. Dusknoir can take a hit or two and KO Gardevoir with Shadow Sneak. Physical attackers that are faster than Gardevoir, such as Sceptile and Choice Scarf Primeape, are great checks. Ironically, Gardevoir's kin, Gallade, can survive a special attack as it is also blessed with great Special Defense, and can cut all ties with Gardevoir with Night Slash.</p>
