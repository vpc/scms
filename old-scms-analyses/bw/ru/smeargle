[Overview]

<p>There is no other Pokemon like Smeargle. It's quite literally the most versatile Pokemon available thanks to the ability to use almost any combination of moves in the game. Smeargle has made a name for itself as Pokemon's resident jack-of-all-trades, as it's able to utilize an extraordinary amount of unique movesets and strategies. However, the fact that Smeargle <i>can</i> use any move in the game doesn't mean that it should. Due to its abysmal stats and mediocre typing, many movesets that Smeargle could use will be much more effective when done by other Pokemon. Smeargle also has zero offensive presence thanks to its pitiable offensive stats, leaving it incredibly prone to Taunt.</p>

<p>It's not all bad news for Smeargle, though. Many of its faults can be made up for with its extensive movepool; for example, Smeargle can use Magic Coat to reflect Taunt back at the user. One of Smeargle's most fearsome qualities is that it's the fastest user of Spore, which is arguably one of the best moves in the game. Spore makes up for Smeargle's complete lack of offensive presence, especially with BW's sleep mechanics—unless the opponent has a Pokemon with Vital Spirit, Insomnia, or something similar to absorb the sleep, they will be forced to pick a Pokemon to lose for at least a few turns. Smeargle has plenty of other game-breaking talents, too; it's by far the most diverse Baton Pass user, as it's able to pass anything from Ingrain to Shift Gear to Quiver Dance, depending on the necessities of your team. Smeargle often is the first Pokemon to meet its end in any given match, but if it's played properly and intelligently, beginning the battle down 6-5 might not be as bad as it sounds after all.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Smeargle is far and away one of the best entry hazard users in RU. Thanks to Focus Sash, it's almost guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock or lay down at least one layer of Spikes—if not more—before biting the dust. Spore is the cornerstone of this set and what separates Smeargle from other suicide Spikes users, as it puts an opponent's Pokemon out of commission for several turns. This can often buy Smeargle more opportunities to set up hazards and phaze the opponent's team around, especially if Smeargle can keep its Focus Sash intact. Spikes and Spore are the only two absolutely essential moves for this set to function well; the remaining two moveslots can use any combination of Magic Coat, Explosion, Whirlwind, and Stealth Rock, depending on your preferences and style of play. Magic Coat is used almost exclusively to prevent opposing Taunt users from shutting down Smeargle entirely, as most Pokemon won't bother attempting to status Smeargle. Whirlwind helps Smeargle get past some of its more traditional counters, such as faster Pokemon with Substitute, and can punish opponents that try to boost after another Pokemon has absorbed Spore. Whirlwind is also unique in the fact that it lets Smeargle take advantage of its own hazards and can reset the sleep counter if the opponent simply tries to wait it out. However, Explosion can be used over Whirlwind if you want Smeargle to go out with a bang, allowing Smeargle to get a teammate in for free while dealing serious damage to any Cryogonal who might attempt to spin away Smeargle's entry hazards. Alternatively, Memento can be used for the same purpose as Explosion, but instead of damaging the opposition, it lowers the opponents Attack and Special Attack stats drastically, possibly giving a teammate a set up opportunity. It should be noted that when using Explosion, an alternate EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature is optimal. Finally, Stealth Rock can be used in place of either of the former moves if one of them doesn't appeal to you.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Smeargle's decent Speed in order to give it the best chance of outrunning the opponent and putting them to sleep before it gets hit. The rest of its EVs are dumped into HP and Defense, but even with investment, Smeargle will almost never survive more than two attacks. It's not worth changing any aspect of this EV spread, simply because Smeargle's abysmal 55 / 35 / 45 defenses mean it will likely not survive even the weakest assaults. Therefore, Smeargle should simply maximize its Speed and hope it's fast enough to get a Spore off. While Smeargle should almost always be used in the lead slot, an exception is when you see Natu in Team Preview. Even though it is somewhat rare, Natu completely shuts down Smeargle, and trying to use it while Natu is still alive and kicking is asking for trouble.</p>

<p>Smeargle's enormous movepool gives it quite a variety of potential options, although most of them aren't as useful as the ones listed above. Endeavor can be used to take another opponent down, but it's generally a better idea to continue setting up entry hazards. Toxic Spikes is a viable option in place of either entry hazard, but they can be easily absorbed by some common Poison-types in RU, namely Qwilfish, Drapion, and Roselia, simply switching in. Toxic Spikes are also not nearly as effective as Spikes and Stealth Rock, as quite a number of the premier defensive Pokemon, such as Mandibuzz and Steelix, aren't bothered by them at all. Taunt can prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up their own hazards or using Taunt on Smeargle, but Magic Coat and Whirlwind perform the same roles. Encore is one of the most interesting options for this set, as it can lock a Pokemon into a non-attacking move and buy Smeargle plenty of time to set up whatever hazards it pleases. Encore works particularly well with Whirlwind, as it can phaze a Pokemon that stays in, hoping for a sweep once Encore ends. Rapid Spin is usable as a niche move if you can't spare a slot for a dedicated spinner.</p>

<p>While the entry hazard support that Smeargle provides is appreciated by nearly every kind of team, it fits best on offensive teams that can capitalize on forced switches. Smeargle's abilities to get entry hazards up and take out a Pokemon with Spore within the first few turns of the game gives most offensive teams a huge advantage right from the start of the match. Smeargle also tends to stay in and set up entry hazards until it is KOed, giving a frail sweeper such as Sceptile a free switch-in to begin wreaking havoc. That same reason is why defensive teams should try to avoid using Smeargle to set up Spikes; compared to other Spikes users, such as Roselia, Qwilfish, and Omastar, it has very little longevity and won't be able to stick around the whole match and set its hazards back up should they get spun away. These other Pokemon also have good defensive synergy and can check important threats while setting up Spikes, which Smeargle cannot. A Ghost-type is a necessary teammate to avoid having your precious entry hazards spun away as soon as Smeargle is KOed. Spiritomb, Rotom, and Golurk are far and away the best available Ghost-types in RU, and most of them have enough of an offensive presence to take advantage of the Spikes that Smeargle sets up.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Shift Gear / Quiver Dance
move 3: Spore
move 4: Substitute
item: Focus Sash
ability: Own Tempo
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Smeargle has traditionally been one of the most prominent Baton Pass users thanks to its immense movepool and Spore. Although the combination of Shell Smash and Baton Pass is illegal in RU, Smeargle can still pass a plethora of other boosting moves, including Shift Gear and Quiver Dance. However, what really sets Smeargle apart from other Baton Pass users is its access to Spore. Smeargle is the only Pokemon with both Baton Pass and an accurate sleep-inducing move in the game, which is a huge advantage over its fellow Baton Pass users; the ability to put the foe to sleep can both buy a turn to set up and cripple a potential threat to its receiver. While it doesn't see as much use because of Smeargle's frailty, Substitute allows Smeargle to evade status and provide a safe switch-in for the receiver, as well as preventing Dragon Tail from knocking away its boosts.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash is the only usable item; without it, Smeargle must rely on its nonexistent bulk to tank a hit while it's trying to set up. In order to set up the best opportunity to use Baton Pass, the EV spread focuses primarily on Smeargle's Speed and bulk. The listed set is intended as a lead on an offensive team, with several potential receivers; if Smeargle is to be used on a dedicated Baton Pass team, several changes should be implemented. First and foremost, Smeargle has a unique niche on Baton Pass teams in its ability to pass Ingrain, which stops opposing teams from phazing away boosts and provides extra recovery. Leftovers can also be used instead of Focus Sash, as the issues with Smeargle's bulk will be largely negated by its teammates' defensive boosts. It might be tempting to stick Ingrain on the listed set for extra recovery, but be aware that it prevents the recipient from switching out manually, which can be an unwanted burden.</p>

<p>Smeargle has the largest movepool of any Pokemon and thus has the most boosting moves it can pass to a receiver. In general, any move that boosts Speed is a great option, because it allows Smeargle to outspeed any potential revenge killers and successfully use Baton Pass. Tail Glow and Belly Drum can skyrocket their respective attacking stats, but they're difficult to pass because Smeargle is so slow and frail. Coil is an option for bulkier Pokemon that can take a few hits, as it also increases Smeargle's durability and the likelihood that its Baton Pass will be successful. Cosmic Power and Cotton Guard can both be used to bolster defenses, although offensive boosting moves are more useful in most situations. Taunt is another possible option in the last slot, as it can block any attempts at phazing or using a status move on the recipient as they switch in.</p>

<p>Ideal teammates would be powerful Pokemon with good coverage, as Smeargle will often only be able to pass its boosts once or twice a game, and being forced out immediately after the Baton Pass would be a waste. Moltres is one of the best receivers of Quiver Dance, as it has excellent coverage, outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in RU at +1, and can shred through teams with a +1 Fire Blast. It's also worth noting that Smeargle can generally stop Stealth Rock from being set up before Moltres takes to the field. Medicham can devastate teams with a Shift Gear boost in hand thanks to the immense power of Hi Jump Kick and the ability to outspeed all common Choice Scarf users, including Manectric. With a Life Orb and an Attack boost, Adamant Medicham has a very good chance to OHKO Tangrowth after Stealth Rock with Hi Jump Kick. There are plenty of other Pokemon that fit these characteristics: Scyther, Entei, Sceptile, Electivire, Crawdaunt, and Aerodactyl can all make excellent receivers, among others. Although Smeargle provides little synergy of its own, it's important that each potential receiver can take advantage of another's counters, so opponents will have to think twice about what Pokemon will be receiving the boosts.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick Room Lead (Level 1)
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Spore
move 3: Endeavor
move 4: Dragon Rage
item: Focus Sash
ability: Own Tempo
nature: Hardy
evs: 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Smeargle is usually seen setting hazards or passing boosts to something more dangerous, this set provides a more offensive presence while still supporting your team with Trick Room, a move that makes slower Pokemon go first. Thanks to the Focus Sash Smeargle has around its waist, the only things that can stop it from setting up Trick Room are Taunt and sleep-inducing moves. This is where the fun begins. Being Level 1, Smeargle is now blazingly fast and ready to fight. Spore is a free kill pretty much every match and exerts huge amounts of offensive pressure on your opponent. Endeavor brings the opposing Pokemon down to Smeargle's HP, easily putting them in KO range of Dragon Rage. Dragon Rage is used over ExtremeSpeed in this case to allow Smeargle to KO Pokemon holding Leftovers; Dragon Rage deals a consistent 40 HP damage, easily enough to KO a Pokemon after Endeavor. When played correctly, Smeargle will at the very least have put a Pokemon to sleep and lowered another one into KO range for your Trick Room sweepers to pick off.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set can easily take down half a team if used carefully, but there is one thing that stops it cold: Ghost-types with Substitute, such as Rotom, who are immune to Endeavor and can avoid Spore with Substitute. Spiritomb does an excellent job of countering Ghost-types thanks to Pursuit and can take advantage of Trick Room with its abysmal base 35 Speed. This Smeargle works best on a dedicated Trick Room team, where it can come in later after a KO and fire off Spores and Endeavors once again. Slowking and Spiritomb make excellent partners to Smeargle, being able to take advantage of Smeargle's Trick Room or set it up themselves, and then set up Nasty Plot or Calm Mind and sweep. Pokemon such as Druddigon, Aggron, and Rampardos also benefit immensely from the Trick Room provided by Smeargle, as they are able to outrun and KO most threats under it. Magic Coat is an option over Dragon Rage to prevent Taunt and sleep-inducing moves from stopping Smeargle from setting up Trick Room, but in return, Smeargle loses the ability to KO anything. Destiny Bond is also an option, allowing Smeargle to score a kill even when facing a Ghost-type, but Dragon Rage is usually better for picking off Pokemon after Leftovers recovery and it basically gets at least one free kill against any team lacking a Ghost-type.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Smeargle has literally every move in the game at its disposal, but the listed options are by far the best ones that Smeargle can use. Any other potential set is likely to be outclassed by another Pokemon with a better stat distribution and typing. For example, Smeargle could use a utility set with Wish, but Alomomola and Lickilicky are far better users of Wish thanks to their incredible HP stats. If you're determined to use a set that isn't listed above, Smeargle can use some rare support moves, such as Tailwind, Encore, and Heal Bell, but its pitiful bulk will leave you wondering why you're using a support set at all. Offensive sets are simply out of the question; the only Pokemon usable in RU that has worse offensive stats than Smeargle is Shuckle, and that's saying something.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Spore is almost guaranteed to be on every Smeargle set, so any Pokemon with Sap Sipper is a good check. Miltank and Sawsbuck will both outspeed and 2HKO Smeargle through its Focus Sash, preventing it from accomplishing anything. Faster users of Substitute will perform similarly, although the Spikes support set can use Whirlwind to blow away the Substitute and any boosts. Taunt is the best way to stop Smeargle, as it will never ever carry an attacking move. However, Taunt users must be wary of a potential Magic Coat. U-turn and Volt Switch users can bring Smeargle down to its Focus Sash and allow you to pick which teammate to sacrifice to the Spore, which could essentially limit Smeargle to only one turn of setting entry hazards or boosting before it gets KOed. Choice Scarf users of the aforementioned moves are especially useful, as most can outspeed even a boosted Smeargle. Pokemon with Lum Berry or Chesto Berry can also lure Spore while activating Smeargle's Focus Sash and then KO it the next turn.</p>

<p>Fake Out is one of the best ways to handle Smeargle, as it removes Smeargle's Focus Sash and stops it from doing anything. Toxic Orb Hariyama can use Fake Out to flinch Smeargle and activate its Toxic Orb, which shuts down Smeargle entirely. Hitmonchan can switch in after Smeargle Spores something and Rapid Spin away its hazards or Mach Punch it to prevent it from passing any boosts. Lead Aerodactyl can easily Taunt Smeargle or 2HKO it with any of its moves. Haze and phazing moves are good methods to stop the Baton Pass set entirely, but they will hardly bother the Spikes set at all. If the Baton Pass set is particularly troubling, Unaware Quagsire can ignore the boosts and wear the opponent down with Toxic. Natu's Magic Bounce ability will reflect Spore back onto Smeargle, as well as Stealth Rock, Whirlwind, and Spikes, making it the only 100% counter to the Spikes set.</p>
