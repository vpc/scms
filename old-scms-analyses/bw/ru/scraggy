[Overview]

<p>Don't let Scraggy's NFE status fool you into thinking that it's not a threat, as Scraggy is far from helpless on the battlefield. While Scraggy's base stats might not look outstanding, or even decent at first, they're just enough for it to get the job done, and Scraggy has unique attributes that further augment its ability and help it stand out from the rest of the crowd, most notably its unresisted STAB combination. Scraggy also boasts two excellent boosting moves in Dragon Dance and Bulk Up, and while at first Scraggy's Attack stat looks too low to effectively utilize them, its aforementioned STAB combination and access to a high Base Power move in Hi Jump Kick make up for this, turning Scraggy into a dangerous threat after a boost. In addition, Scraggy possesses an excellent ability in Shed Skin, making it resistant to dangerous status conditions and allowing it to set up on a wider variety of Pokemon with little fear. Scraggy is not without its flaws, however; while Scraggy's Speed stat is acceptable after a Dragon Dance, beating out positive nature base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Drapion and Jynx, it's still somewhat vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Sceptile and Durant, somewhat reducing its effectiveness. Likewise, Scraggy's Bulk Up set is very hard to KO outright, but opponents can break through it with strong Fighting- and Flying-type moves. In the end, Scraggy isn't a top threat by any means, but underestimating it is a grave mistake.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Scraggy isn't the fastest or most powerful Pokemon around, it's still an effective user of Dragon Dance. Because of Scraggy's respectable bulk with Eviolite factored in, and excellent ability in Shed Skin, it's capable of setting up on various defensive Pokemon with ease, notably Uxie, Lanturn, and Spiritomb. It can then use its excellent STAB combination to plow through the opposing team. Hi Jump Kick is Scraggy's most powerful STAB attack, hitting an absolutely massive 130 Base Power even without STAB factored in. This is the move Scraggy will be using whenever it needs to break through bulkier Pokemon quickly like Druddigon. Be careful when using Hi Jump Kick, though, as any team with a Ghost-type or Protect user can take advantage of it if you don't play carefully. On the other hand, Drain Punch provides Scraggy with a weaker, more consistent STAB move to use when it can't risk using Hi Jump Kick or doesn't need the extra power. Drain Punch also gives Scraggy some nice HP recovery, which is especially significant because of Scraggy's relatively low HP stat and respectable defenses. Crunch rounds out Scraggy's coverage, giving it an effective way to get past bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Spiritomb, Uxie, and Slowking.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread used here is pretty straightforward: they maximize Scraggy's damage output, while also making sure it can outrun positive nature base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Drapion and Jynx, at +1, as well as Timid Accelgor at +2. An Adamant nature can be used if you think Scraggy needs a bit more power behind its attacks, but keep in mind that this makes Scraggy significantly slower as well, not even being able to outpace Adamant Entei without the extra Speed boost provided by a Jolly nature. While Shed Skin is an incredibly useful ability for Scraggy, both Intimidate and Moxie are viable options as well. Intimidate cuts the opponent's Attack stat upon switch in, possibly netting Scraggy a free boost, and also allows Scraggy to fodder itself as an emergency stop to a potentially dangerous opponent. Moxie increases Scraggy's Attack stat every time it scores a KO, punishing the opponent for trying to sacrifice something to Scraggy. However, its usefulness is short-lived, because after the first KO or two, Moxie's Attack boosts start becoming overkill, and status resistance is usually more helpful.</p>

<p>Like any offensive Pokemon, Scraggy appreciates hazards support to help it score KOs more easily. Qwilfish is an excellent option for hazards support, having the typing and bulk to set up multiple layers of Spikes while checking some of the Fighting-types that trouble Scraggy such as Hitmonlee and Emboar. Furthermore, Qwilfish can use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis, letting Scraggy sweep with fewer boosts. Lastly, Qwilfish's Intimidate can cushion against various physical attackers, making it easier for Scraggy to grab a Dragon Dance. In return, Scraggy can grab a free boost on some of the Psychic-types that prey on Qwilfish's low Special Defense and Poison typing, switching in on their attacks with complete impunity due to its Dark typing. Uxie is a good option for hazards support as well, setting up Stealth Rock for Scraggy while checking the Fighting-types Scraggy struggles with and spreading paralysis just like Qwilfish.</p>

<p>Dual screens work well with Dragon Dance Scraggy, augmenting its already good bulk and making it significantly easier for Scraggy to accumulate multiple boosts, especially in conjunction with Shed Skin. Once again, Uxie makes an excellent teammate for Scraggy, as it's arguably the best user of dual screens in the entire tier, with the bulk to set up multiple times in a match and even access to Memento to get Scraggy in for free. Outside of Uxie, Gardevoir, Mesprit, and even Audino can serve as effective users of dual screens, each having their own advantages and disadvantages. Although Scraggy's excellent dual STABs and Shed Skin ability give it the advantage over most defensive Pokemon, Scraggy still struggles with a few physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, Poliwrath, and Quagsire, making a Pokemon that can break through them an excellent option for a teammate. Gallade and Moltres both perform this role admirably, being able to switch in on at least two of the four offenders and pose a significant threat in return with a combination of raw power and coverage. Likewise, Scraggy can use many of both Moltres's and Gallade's checks as setup bait, taking advantage of Lanturn, Regirock, and Spiritomb, respectively.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Scraggy's impressive Eviolite-boosted bulk, access to Shed Skin, and ability to use Drain Punch to damage the opponent while restoring its health in one move all make Scraggy a good user of Bulk Up. This set has an even easier time setting up on common defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn than the Dragon Dance set does thanks to the defensive investment. Bulk Up bolsters Scraggy's Defense stat to impressive levels while simultaneously increasing its Attack, turning it into a powerful and bulky threat in no time. Drain Punch is easily Scraggy's most reliable STAB move, and the extra HP recovery that it gives is certainly appreciated on a set like this, especially given that Scraggy's HP stat is very low, maximizing the recovery it gets from using the move. Crunch is Scraggy's best secondary STAB move for hitting the bulky Fighting-type resists such as Uxie, Slowking, Rotom, and Spiritomb. Rest gives Scraggy an effective way to fully restore its health at any time especially because Shed Skin makes Rest significantly more reliable than it is when used by other Pokemon such as Poliwrath.</p>

<p>To show how bulky Scraggy is, here are a few damage calculations against some common RU Pokemon:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>0 SpA Slowking Scald: 17.1% - 20.72%</li>
<li>252+ SpA Slowking Surf: 28.61% - 33.88%</li>
<li>0 SpA Cryogonal Ice Beam: 19.73% - 23.68%</li>
<li>252 SpA Icicle Plate Cryogonal Ice Beam: 30.59% - 35.85%</li>
<li>252 Atk Life Orb Drapion Poison Jab: 38.81% - 46.05<li>
<li>252 SpA Choice Specs Mesprit Thunderbolt: 26.97% - 31.9%<li>
<li>252 SpA Life Orb Rotom Thunderbolt: 32.56% - 38.81%</li>
</ul>

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Scraggy's special bulk, since Bulk Up shores up Scraggy's Defense stat, and also lets Scraggy outpace minimum Speed Tangrowth and Piloswine. If you feel Scraggy needs some more power behind its attacks, Hi Jump Kick is an option over Drain Punch to greatly increase its damage output, but Drain Punch has better synergy with the rest of this set due to its perfect accuracy and recovery. Likewise, Payback is an option over Crunch if you want Scraggy to have a stronger Dark-type STAB, but Payback is only stronger against opponents that are faster than Scraggy, and while Scraggy is in fact quite slow, many important bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Slowking and Spiritomb, are actually slower than it, so Crunch's consistency is generally more useful. Note that you shouldn't try to sweep with Scraggy early on in the match, as you'll have a much harder time being successful if you attempt to do so. Bulk Up Scraggy functions best mid-game and late-game, when its checks and counters are weakened or eliminated, and should be treated as such. Even though Scraggy is incredibly hard to KO with a Bulk Up under its belt, Pokemon with powerful Fighting- and Flying-type moves such as Gallade, Moltres, Braviary, and Emboar can still break through it, so checks to them make good teammates. Uxie, Spiritomb, Qwilfish, and Slowking can check the Fighting-type Pokemon that trouble Scraggy, while Rhydon, Regirock, and Lanturn check the various Flying-types that can break through Scraggy's defenses. If you do use Rhydon or Regirock, though, a check to Fighting-types is that much more important.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Outside of its STAB attacks, Scraggy has quite a wide offensive movepool that it can use to its advantage; these include the elemental punches, Stone Edge, and Zen Headbutt. These moves can be useful at times for hitting certain opponents such as Moltres, Escavalier, and Amoonguss harder, but Scraggy doesn't really need them in the end because of the perfect coverage its STABs provide. Scraggy could also run a purely defensive set with Intimidate, functioning as a bulky pivot while using moves such as Toxic, Knock Off, Roar, Super Fang, and Foul Play to mess with the opposition, but the lack of reliable recovery outside of Drain Punch limits its effectiveness. Lastly, Taunt is an option on the Dragon Dance set to make setting up on defensive Pokemon even easier while also stopping the opponent from doing things such as setting up hazards or phazing, but Scraggy has trouble finding a moveslot for it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Poliwrath is the best counter to Scraggy available; it has the physical bulk to take even boosted Hi Jump Kicks from the little lizard and can phaze Scraggy out with a super effective Circle Throw in return. However, Poliwrath has trouble breaking through Bulk Up Scraggy if it's the last Pokemon. Qwilfish makes a good check to Scraggy as well, possessing a handy resistance to Scraggy's Fighting-type moves and using either Taunt or Haze to stop Scraggy from accumulating any more boosts, eventually wearing it out with Waterfall. Quagsire has enough physical bulk to take a Hi Jump Kick from Scraggy, has Unaware to ignore any boosts Scraggy might have under its belt, and can retaliate with Earthquake. Amoonguss resists Scraggy's Fighting-type attacks, has the physical bulk to take a Crunch, and can recover HP by switching out when needed thanks to Regenerator; Amoonguss struggles against the Bulk Up set if it lacks Clear Smog, though. Moltres makes a good check to Scraggy as long as Stealth Rock isn't up, but is OHKOed by a +1 Crunch if the Scraggy user manages to set up Stealth Rock, making it a somewhat shaky counter. Pokemon that carry Trick or Switcheroo, such as Rotom-C and Manectric, can remove Scraggy's Eviolite and replace it with an undesirable item such as a Choice Scarf, limiting its effectiveness for the rest of the match. Outside of these Pokemon and moves, there are some other checks to Scraggy that depend on the set, beating one rather easily while struggling with the other. If all else fails, faster Pokemon, including Choice Scarf Emboar, Sceptile, Accelgor, and Durant, can revenge kill Dragon Dance Scraggy even after a boost. Likewise, Pokemon with powerful Fighting- and Flying-types moves such as Gallade, Braviary, and Hitmonlee can break through Bulk Up Scraggy before it becomes too dangerous.</p>
