[Overview]

<p>Dodrio is average as a Flying-type goes. Its physical options are limited to a whopping four types, all of which leave it hopelessly walled by Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon. It is too frail to abuse Taunt effectively, while the Stealth Rock weakness and Brave Bird recoil only compounds the problem. Granted, Dodrio's base 100 Speed and 110 Attack allows it to dole out serious pain with Brave Bird after its counters are removed, but so can myriad of other Normal- and Flying-types. The bottom line is, don't expect Dodrio to do too much.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set has a very deep strategy: Brave Bird until Dodrio dies, the opponent dies, or a Rock-type shows up. Brave Bird and Return are obligatory dual STABs that make the most of Dodrio's puny movepool. STAB Quick Attack, especially with the Choice Band boost, is surprisingly strong and can come in handy for revenge killing Galvantula and other speedy threats. Pursuit can kill Cryogonal, Rotom, and other physically frail threats that switch out in fear of a Brave Bird. However, Pursuit from a Choice Scarf Dodrio is depressingly weak, so Toxic is an option to slowly wear down Rock-type Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band is often the superior item choice; it allows Dodrio to hit excruciatingly hard with Brave Bird, and Quick Attack will often be enough for revenge killing purposes. Still, Choice Scarf allows Dodrio to outspeed most of the metagame and function as an effective revenge killer. The EVs and nature emphasize Attack and Speed, Dodrio's two standout traits. Make sure the remaining 4 EVs don't go into HP, as otherwise Dodrio will not be able to switch into Stealth Rock four times.</p>

<p>Dodrio requires a healthy amount of support in order to be a viable option. As with every Stealth Rock weak Pokemon, Dodrio appreciates Rapid Spin support from the likes of Kabutops and Cryogonal. As Dodrio is helpless against Steel- and Rock-types, Magneton is an especially notable teammate; in addition to trapping and eliminating Steel-types, it also resists all of Dodrio's weaknesses and lures in Earthquakes for Dodrio to safely switch in. Dodrio can also utilize Baton Pass in his Choice Band set—a strategy known as dry passing. Even with no boosts to pass, Dodrio's Baton Pass acts as a safe scouting move when a Rock-type switch-in is highly probable. However, this requires the sacrifice of Brave Bird, Dodrio's strongest Flying-type STAB, so you would have to be content with the weaker power of Drill Peck instead.</p>

[SET]
name: Utility Attacker
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dodrio is one of the few Flying-types with access to Taunt, and although it certainly does not have the ideal bulk for the move, it does have the speed. Taunt and Roost let Dodrio beat otherwise troublesome physical walls such as Spiritomb. Once again, Brave Bird is the attacking move of choice due to its high Base Power. As Dodrio lacks many other options, Return is listed as a recoil-free STAB move that can hit Electric-types. The struggle to stay alive with Taunt and Roost may seem pointless, but this Dodrio is significantly easier to use, as it can deny game-changing setup from the likes of SubPunch Aggron and Shell Smash Omastar. Many Pokemon salivate at the prospect of setting up on Choice attacks, and sacrificing Dodrio's life for the game is far more desirable than getting swept by an Omastar. If you dislike Taunt on such a frail Pokemon, Toxic is an option over Taunt to combat physical walls: with Toxic, Dodrio can cripple the predictable Alomomola or Rhydon switch-in with little risk.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature are again self explanatory. Life Orb is the preferred item for its significant power boost, but Sharp Beak can be used if you do not desire strong recoil on Brave Bird. Even with the increased damage from Life Orb, Dodrio will still be hard countered by Rock- and Steel-types. However, this set is not completely helpless against them. Dodrio can Taunt Steelix and Omastar to prevent hazards, though this is a risky proposition. Toxic will wear down Rock-types such as Rhydon and Omastar, and will allow another Flying-type to clean up afterward. Dodrio can act as an effective stallbreaker thanks to Taunt, and any stall team without a Rock- or Steel-type will have a hard time beating this this set. Still, beware of Dodrio's paltry bulk; Uxie's Psychic or Qwilfish's Waterfall chips away half of Dodrio's health, and attempting to stall them out is the equivalent of begging for a critical hit. Rapid Spin support from Kabutops or Cryogonal helps significantly, as this Dodrio aims to stay around longer at the cost of a weaker Brave Bird.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You may expect that, as a Normal-type, Dodrio has multiple other options, but you would be sadly mistaken. Its special options are limited to Hidden Power, Tri Attack, and the legendary Mud-Slap; none of them are viable thanks to Dodrio's pathetic Special Attack stat. Other than its STAB attacks, its strongest physical moves include Faint Attack and Steel Wing. Steel Wing is indeed its strongest move against Rhydon, mustering a 3HKO against Eviolite Rhydon assuming Choice Band, but is otherwise a bad idea. As for supporting options, Dodrio has access to Acupressure, Agility, and Baton Pass, allowing it to pass a random +2 boost in any stat or a consistent +2 boost in Speed. However, Acupressure is gimmicky in nature, and has a tendency to boost the most useless stat in any given circumstance; unless Lady Luck is your acquaintance, Baton Passing Acupressure is a high-risk and low-reward strategy.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As repeated throughout this analysis, Dodrio is walled by Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon. Steelix, Aggron, and Rhydon can take hits from Dodrio until the cows come home, and they can either limit Dodrio's switches with Stealth Rock or simply blast Dodrio into next week with a super effective STAB move. Physical walls such as Alomomola and Rotom can status Dodrio and stall out its Brave Bird. However, these walls need to watch out for Taunt, since they are incapable of dealing much damage to Dodrio.</p>

<p>Dodrio can threaten to trample over your team should it lack a Flying-type resist. However, Dodrio is weak to Stealth Rock and has pathetic defenses; anything that can outspeed Dodrio should not have a difficult time OHKOing it. Even if Dodrio happens to outspeed your entire party, do not fear; Brave Bird's massive recoil should kill off Dodrio after a few attacks, ensuring that no matter how bad you are, Dodrio will never 6-0 you.</p>
