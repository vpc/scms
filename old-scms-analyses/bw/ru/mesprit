[Overview]

<p>Mesprit stands out as one of the most versatile threats in the RU metagame. This is thanks to its well-rounded stat distribution, with a perfect blend of power and bulk. Mesprit's movepool is also incredibly wide, which lets it run many different sets successfully, including Choice sets, boosting sets, and supportive sets to great effect. It's also one of the best offensive checks to various Fighting- and Psychic-types in the tier as it can check the likes of Slowking, Gallade, and Sigilyph admirably while still maintaining offensive pressure on the opponent.</p>

<p>However, Mesprit is not without its flaws. The same Psychic typing that lets it check Slowking and Gallade so well also leaves it weak to Pursuit, and there are plenty of good users of the move in RU such as Absol, Spiritomb, and Escavalier. Mesprit also has trouble handling Steel-types, especially the aforementioned Escavalier, as the only moves it has to take them out are Hidden Power Fire and Fire Punch, both of which lack much power. Despite Mesprit's incredibly wide movepool, it is missing one key ingredient: a reliable recovery move. This means that Mesprit will often fold to repeated onslaughts over the course of the match. Even with these flaws, Mesprit is an incredibly versatile threat and can benefit many teams. So long as you play to Mesprit's unique strengths, you can be certain it will be anything but fun for your opponent to deal with.</p>

[SET]

move 3: Thunderbolt / Ice Beam
move 4: U-turn / Healing Wish
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set combines many of Mesprit's abilities into one set. It retains Mesprit's bulk, power, and supporting movepool to make for a very flexible set. This is one of the safest Stealth Rock users to lead with since Mesprit can simply U-turn out if it gets stuck with a bad match-up. Mesprit is able to check most Fighting- and Psychic-types in the tier and it can find a chance to setup Stealth Rock as one of these threats switches out of it. Psychic is the obligatory STAB move on Mesprit with its power and reliability. This allows Mesprit to directly check Fighting-types without having to rely solely on its bulk and typing to force them out. The third slot is where Mesprit has to make a choice for its auxiliary coverage option. Thunderbolt is generally preferred as Mesprit is one of the best offensive checks to Slowking in the tier. Thunderbolt also lets Mesprit handle Kabutops with more ease while also obliterating the likes of Samurott, Crawdaunt, and Feraligatr before they have a chance to setup or take out Mesprit. However, Ice Beam is an option to better handle Sceptile and Rotom-C, two dangerous Grass-types that can usually beat Mesprit one-on-one otherwise. It also has the advantage of dealing heavy damage to Druddigon, one of the most common and dangerous Pokemon in the tier. The last slot gives Mesprit added utility. U-turn is generally preferred as it allows Mesprit to perform as a solid pivot and improves its chances of getting Stealth Rock up on more than one occasion; it also allows Mesprit to switch out of a bad match-up. That said, Healing Wish is a potentially game-changing move and Mesprit is one of the few viable users of it in RU. While this does hurt its pivoting abilities early- and mid-game, Mesprit can bring back a teammate late in the game after it has served its purpose.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Mesprit's offensive potential, but you do have other options if you want Mesprit to tank hits a little better. If you only need Mesprit to outspeed Absol, then you can invest only 216 EVs into Speed. This also keeps Mesprit ahead of Samurott and other base 70s. If these threats are of no concern for your team, you can drop Mesprit's Speed EVs down to 164 to keep the edge over neutral base 80s. It is not advised to drop below this as you would probably be better off using Uxie if you desire any more bulk. Mesprit has options for its item as well. Leftovers is the preferred option as it will keep Mesprit from being worn down as easily. That said, you can use Colbur Berry. This allows Mesprit to take a Pursuit and live to tell the tale later. This lets Mesprit play a bit more freely early on in the presence of a Pursuit user. Lastly, you can use a Life Orb to get as much power as possible. However, this detracts from Mesprit's bulk and will also make U-turn more of a liability. The only other move to be considered on this set is Hidden Power Fire as it's the only move Mesprit has to smack Steel-types with such as Escavalier and Ferroseed.</p>

<p>Mesprit's best teammates are those that can handle its weaknesses. Fighting-types such as Emboar are very good as they can take Bug- and Dark-type moves that Mesprit doesn't like. Steel-types such as Aggron and Klinklang are also solid options as Mesprit can check the Ground- and Fighting-types that give them trouble while they can keep Mesprit safe against all of its weaknesses. Ferroseed and Qwilfish both share good synergy with Mesprit and can form a solid hazard setting core. When running U-turn, Mesprit can perform very well on VoltTurn teams as its unique access to both Stealth Rock and U-turn as well as its offensive presence is a huge boon for such teams and can free up teamslots for other forms of support. Magneton, Braviary, Rotom-C, and Manectric are all solid choices for a VoltTurn team.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psyshock / Psychic
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to turn Mesprit into a late-game special sweeper capable of running through teams with its stellar power and coverage. Calm Mind is the boosting move of choice, as it gives Mesprit the Special Attack boost it needs to sweep teams. The Special Defense boost also makes it much harder to revenge kill Mesprit on the special side. The choice of Mesprit's STAB move comes down to whether you want to break past special walls or if you want a stronger hit on physical walls. Since BoltBeam coverage hits most physical walls hard enough after a boost, Psyshock is generally preferred as it lets Mesprit get around Gallade, Cryogonal, and Clefable with much greater ease. However, Psychic is still viable for more consistent power. Thunderbolt allows Mesprit to pummel the likes of Slowking, Sigilyph, and Crawdaunt without a second thought. This is extremely useful as Mesprit is a great offensive check to the former two. Finally, Ice Beam fills the last slot to break through Tangrowth, Rhydon, and Torterra regardless of which STAB move Mesprit chooses.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Mesprit should not deviate from the specified EV spread and nature with this set. Mesprit wants all the speed and power it can get or otherwise risk getting outsped by Absol. Hidden Power Fire is a noteworthy move for its ability to let Mesprit take out bulky Steel-types such as Escavalier, Steelix, and Ferroseed and can be used over Ice Beam if needed. It is advised to use Psychic with Hidden Power Fire though as Mesprit won't have a way of getting past Rhydon otherwise.</p>

<p>Spiritomb is the biggest issue for this set, followed closely by Escavalier. The former can play deadly mind games with Mesprit between Sucker Punch, Pursuit, and Shadow Sneak while the latter can handle a couple of hits from Mesprit and hit back hard with Pursuit. Escavalier is also a huge pain unless Mesprit runs Hidden Power Fire. Uxie can take a few hits and cripple Mesprit with Thunder Wave. Outside of Escavalier, Absol is a fine teammate as it can trap and eliminate most of these threats with Pursuit and it can even use Fire Blast to lure in and KO Escavalier. Emboar also fears little from these threats with the lone exception of Uxie and won't have a problem in handling them with Flare Blitz or Superpower. Rhydon can pair well with Mesprit since it can handle Ground- and Fighting-type moves for Rhydon, while the latter an take on most fast physical attackers that are typically used to revenge kill Mesprit, and also set up Stealth Rock. Qwilfish is a great Spikes user to use with Mesprit since it can check the likes of Escavalier, Durant, and Entei. Other entry hazard users to consider are Smeargle, Ferroseed, Golurk, Steelix, and Scolipede as they can support Mesprit in various other ways.</p>

evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Mesprit gives up the ability to switch moves in exchange for an immediate power boost. While Mesprit may seem outclassed by Slowking in this role at first, it comes with three advantages; great three move coverage, Levitate to get a free pass on Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and U-turn to be able to ease prediction. Psyshock is Mesprit's preferred STAB move as this lets it act as a "mixed attacker" of sorts; Thunderbolt and Ice Beam hit most physical walls for super effective damage anyway. Speaking of those moves, they give Mesprit great BoltBeam coverage to use alongside its Psychic STAB. Ice Beam lets Mesprit check most Grass- and Ground-types such as Sceptile, Rhydon, and Tangrowth effectively, the latter two being able to sponge Psyshock quite handily. Thunderbolt lets Mesprit perform as a great offensive check to Slowking and Sigilyph while also OHKOing Moltres regardless of whether Stealth Rock is up or not. The last moveslot gives Mesprit utility depending on what you're looking for. U-turn is generally preferred as it lets Mesprit play safer early on and avoid getting trapped by Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Absol. As this Mesprit aims to break down as many walls as possible, Hidden Power Fire is a good option to handle bulky Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Escavalier, the latter of which can put Mesprit in a no-win situation otherwise. Although it's rare that Mesprit will ever need to get rid of its Choice Specs, Trick is useful to cripple opposing walls such as Ferroseed, Clefable, and Cryogonal. This is especially useful if Mesprit chooses Psychic, as it then has few other ways past special walls.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature is advised with a maximum EV spread on offense. However, as Choice Specs Mesprit is a fine offensive pivot thanks to Levitate and its decent bulk, you can lower the Speed EVs to capitalize on this if you wish. 216 Speed EVs outspeed Absol while 164 EVs will keep Mesprit ahead of neutral base 80s such as Gallade and Kabutops. Any EVs removed from Speed should be allocated in HP. If Hidden Power Fire is used, then it is advised to drop down to one of these benchmarks due to the imperfect Speed IV that is required for the move. Although Modest is an option for more power, Mesprit then loses out on the ability to vary this EV spread as it cannot afford to risk losing the Speed tie against Gallade.</p>

<p>Spikes support is really useful as most of Mesprit's checks are grounded. Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Scolipede are great bulky Spikers to fall back on when Mesprit is forced out. Qwilfish is a solid check to Escavalier, Durant, and Entei; Ferroseed handles many threats due to its set of resistances; and Scolipede has Megahorn to handle Uxie and Cryogonal quite handily. Stealth Rock users are also helpful. Rhydon, Omastar, and Golurk are all fine options for this. When not running Hidden Power Fire, Mesprit will need a teammate to handle Escavalier. Fire-types such as Emboar, Typhlosion, and Entei are more than capable of maiming Escavalier with their Fire-type STAB moves, and they also make for solid checks to Spiritomb as well. A lure such as mixed Druddigon or Absol can also be used as both are capable of running Fire-type coverage moves to take out Escavalier once they've lured it in. As Mesprit is more of a utility wallbreaker, it is pretty easy to form a wallbreaking core with it. Aggron and Emboar are two very good examples. Aggron can help put pressure on opposing Steel-types and can often overwhelm them alongside Mesprit, and Emboar just flat out destroys Steel-types with a Choice Band set. Mesprit can help both get in with U-turn as Aggron and Emboar are usually too slow to directly switch into many attacks. Speaking of U-turn, Mesprit works well on VoltTurn teams when it uses the move. Typical VoltTurn team members such as Rotom-C, Magneton, and Braviary are all good options and appreciate Mesprit's wide coverage. Magneton deserves a special mention as it can outright trap and KO any Steel-type that Mesprit U-turns out of.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Mesprit is more than capable of using its Speed to outspeed and KO opponents, it is just slow enough to utilize Trick Room effectively. Mesprit is a very flexible Trick Room user as it can either try to be a self-sufficient sweeper or unique supporter inside Trick Room. Psyshock is the preferred STAB move as it lets Mesprit get past Cryogonal, Clefable, and Gallade with greater ease. If Life Orb isn't used as the held item, then Psychic is preferred for its more consistent power. Thunderbolt is a necessity on this set as it allows Mesprit to deal with Slowking, a common threat to Trick Room teams, while providing great coverage with Psychic or Psyshock. It also lets Mesprit deal with the likes of Moltres, Aerodactyl, and Sigilyph when Trick Room is active. Mesprit has an important decision to make in the last slot as the choice will determine how Mesprit functions on the team. Ice Beam completes Mesprit's coverage and allows it to handle Rhydon and Tangrowth with greater ease. However, if coverage on these threats isn't needed and you want Mesprit to be more of a supporter, then Healing Wish is a great alternative. With it, Mesprit can bring back a weakened Trick Room sweeper after setting Trick Room up late-game and let the sweeper finish what it started earlier. If you decide to use Healing Wish, it is highly recommended to run Psychic for Mesprit's STAB option to let it deal with Tangrowth and Rhydon better.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The goal of the EV spread is to make Mesprit as "fast" as possible inside Trick Room. A Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs is used to achieve this. As far as the item selection goes, it all depends on your preference in the final moveslot. Life Orb should be used if Mesprit is more offensive, but Leftovers is more useful if Mesprit is run in a supportive manner. If you have no need for Ice Beam but still want a coverage option in the last slot, then Hidden Power Fire is useful to lure in and KO Escavalier, a major threat to many Trick Room teams due to its incredibly low Speed and immense power. Mesprit can also KO Durant with it should Trick Room be active. However, this will require Mesprit to increase its Speed IV to 2 in order to keep Hidden Power Fire at maximum power.</p>

<p>Since Mesprit's goal is to setup Trick Room, it will need teammates need to take advantage of it. Aggron, Escavalier, and Emboar are very good Trick Room sweepers that synergize well with Mesprit and can deal with the majority of threats Mesprit attracts. Other Trick Room setters such as Slowking, Exeggutor, and Dusknoir are helpful to lessen the pressure on Mesprit to keep setting up Trick Room. Druddigon is a solid teammate as well for its ability to setup Stealth Rock early-game and take advantage of Trick Room later on. Rhydon, Marowak, and Hariyama are some other examples of Trick Room sweepers, but they don't have as useful defensive synergy with Mesprit as Aggron or Emboar.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Mesprit is more commonly seeing using Calm Mind in a more aggressive fashion, it can certainly utilize the move in a more defensive approach. While this set may seem outclassed by Uxie, Mesprit holds a couple of key advantages over its cousin. Mesprit has more immediate power and requires fewer boosts to become a threat, and its ability to potentially use Ice Beam means it isn't always walled by Steelix. Substitute and Calm Mind form the centerpiece of the set, thus creating the well-known SubCM strategy. Substitute shields Mesprit from status while setting up and makes it harder to revenge kill once it starts to sweep. Psyshock is the STAB move of choice here as it prevents Cryogonal and Clefable from being able to wall the set. Thunderbolt is the preferred coverage move in the last slot to get the best neutral coverage with Mesprit's Psychic STAB. However, since the combination of Psyshock + Thunderbolt is walled by the likes of Rhydon, Steelix, and Tangrowth, you can opt to use Ice Beam to handle these threats. However, note that without Thunderbolt, Mesprit has no hope of getting past Slowking and will struggle more against Moltres.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As this Mesprit takes a more defensive approach to sweeping, the EV spread attempts to support this. Enough Speed EVs are used to keep Mesprit ahead of neutral base 80 Pokemon such as Gallade and Kabutops. 4 EVs are taken from Special Attack to hit an HP number optimal for making Substitutes. Psychic is an option for Mesprit's STAB move if you don't want to resort to Ice Beam in order to hit the likes of Rhydon and Tangrowth hard. A fully offensive EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is viable to let Mesprit outspeed Absol 100% of the time while tying with other positive base 80 Pokemon.</p>

<p>Since this Mesprit uses Substitute to aid in its setup, it will always have holes in its coverage. Teammates that can handle what Mesprit's coverage move doesn't are essential. When lacking Ice Beam, Samurott is perhaps the best choice as it is fully capable of wiping out Rhydon, Steelix, Druddigon, and Tangrowth. It can also take out Slowking should Mesprit lack Thunderbolt. Magneton, Escavalier, and Klinklang are two Steel-types that check this set very nicely. Emboar, Entei, and Magmortar are good Fire-types that can swiftly eliminate both of these Steel-types. Regirock isn't an incredibly common Pokemon in RU, but it is more than capable of handling this set no matter which coverage move Mesprit uses. Again, Samurott works well here, but Rotom-C, Sceptile, and Omastar can also handle Regirock. Entry hazards are also very helpful to Mesprit as it will lack the immediate power of its other offensive sets. Qwilfish handles Escavalier well enough and can even setup Toxic Spikes which can let Mesprit stall a little with Substitute if it's needed in order to drop a target into KO range. Scolipede is also useful, as it can handle opposing Slowking and Uxie with its STAB Megahorn. Rhydon and Steelix are sturdy Stealth Rock users that synergize well with Mesprit. Lastly, a Pursuit user can be helpful to get rid of bulky Psychic-types such as Uxie and opposing Mesprit. Escavalier and Absol are solid choices as the former can weaken Steel-types and most physical walls for Mesprit while the latter can lure in and KO most physical walls if it chooses to run Fire Blast.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Mesprit is most commonly seen using its reasonable bulk and amazing coverage to wreak havoc on opposing teams, it can utilize Choice Scarf effectively as well thanks to its great three-move coverage and solid utility options. While Mesprit may lack the power and speed of other Choice Scarf users, it makes up for this with great coverage and solid utility. Psychic is the better STAB option on this set for its reliable power as this Mesprit doesn't aim to break past walls. However, Psyshock is still an option to better handle the likes of Gallade and Cryogonal, but it misses the OHKO on Qwilfish. Thunderbolt allows Mesprit to still check Slowking, but it also allows it to revenge kill serious threats such as Moltres and boosted Omastar. Ice Beam completes the BoltBeam combination and allows Mesprit to take on and defeat the likes of Sceptile and Swellow. The last slot gives Mesprit some added utility and ensures it is not outclassed as a Choice Scarf user. Trick allows Mesprit to cripple walls such as Clefable, Ferroseed, and Slowking. U-turn allows Mesprit to scout for and weaken its checks and counters throughout the match. Finally, Mesprit can utilize Healing Wish. While it may seem like an odd choice, Mesprit can easily come in and use the move late-game if it has removed the needed threats, and there is a weakened teammate in need.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature is used to outspeed Aerodactyl, +2 Omastar, and Dragon Dance Feraligatr. A Modest nature can give Mesprit more power, but the added power is rarely worth the ability to outspeed these threats. Hidden Power Fire can allow Mesprit to deal heavy damage to Escavalier and revenge kill Durant, but Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are generally preferred for their better overall utility.</p>

<p>While Pursuit users are normally a detriment to Mesprit, they are a complete stop to this set since Mesprit is normally locked into a move. Spiritomb and Escavalier are both major counters as they have the bulk to take multiple hits from Mesprit and proceed to trap it with Pursuit. This makes Emboar and Aggron very solid partners as both can handle most of what Spiritomb and Escavalier have to offer. Emboar also matches up well against Absol, another common Pursuit user that can check this set. Entry hazards are extremely important for this set as Mesprit lacks any way of boosting its Special Attack. Steelix sets up Stealth Rock and walls Escavalier well, and can also check Absol lacking Fire Blast as well as Spiritomb. Qwilfish and Roselia are good Spikes users to pair with Mesprit. Qwilfish can keep Escavalier and Absol in check while Roselia can handle Lilligant and Choice Scarf Rotom-C. If Mesprit uses U-turn, then other U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Rotom-C and Braviary can form a VoltTurn core with it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Mesprit is commonly seen utilizing its expansive special movepool, it has a solid physical movepool and Attack to work with as well. While most other Choice Band users have incredible power to overwhelm the opposing team, Mesprit's perks lie in its great coverage and utility. For these reasons, this Mesprit functions best as a strong hit-and-run attacker. Zen Headbutt is Mesprit's only physical STAB option, but it takes out common switch-ins such as Cryogonal and Clefable for heavy damage; the flinch chance can also come in handy at times. U-turn hits much harder than it does on the other sets and it allows Mesprit to scout for checks and counters early on. It has the power to OHKO Absol, who may switch in expecting a STAB move. ThunderPunch is necessary for Mesprit to handle Slowking and Kabutops effectively. The last slot depends on what you're looking for. Fire Punch is preferred to at least dent physical walls such as Tangrowth and Steelix to an extent. It also lets Mesprit pummel Escavalier which commonly switches into Mesprit. While rarely needed, Trick allows Mesprit to cripple walls such as Tangrowth and Slowking and can possibly open up an opportunity for a teammate to sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because all of Mesprit's physical attacks are weaker in Base Power than most other physical attackers, an Adamant nature is necessary to have sufficient power. Ice Punch is an option if Druddigon is an issue for your team, but Mesprit really needs Fire Punch to leave a dent in Tangrowth and Steelix.</p>

<p>This Mesprit acts as more of a utility wallbreaker as its power is sufficient, but not overwhelming like other Choice Band users. For this reason, Aggron and Escavalier are good options for overwhelming physical walls. Alternatively, you can use the likes of Typhlosion and Rotom-C to put pressure on both sides of a defensive core. Entry hazards help Mesprit attain more KOs and help make up for its lower power when compared to other Choice Band users. Rhydon, Steelix, and Druddigon are all good Stealth Rock users to use with Mesprit while Qwilfish, Ferroseed, Scolipede, and Roselia can supply Spikes and check various threats. Absol is less of a problem on this set since Mesprit can catch it with U-turn on the switch and KO it while Fire Punch can KO Escavalier. However, Spiritomb is still a major issue and it's ideal to have a check to Escavalier to ease prediction against it. Emboar works very well against both of these threats while other Fire-types such as Moltres, Typhlosion, and Entei work nicely as well. A Pursuit user of your own such as Absol or Escavalier is useful in order to remove Uxie and Slowking from play.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>As mentioned in the overview, Mesprit has a very wide movepool. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster threats such as Sceptile, Scolipede, and Cinccino. However, Mesprit is hard pressed for moveslots on most of its sets as it is. Moreover, Uxie and Slowking are better choices to spread paralysis as Psychic-types thanks to their greater bulk. Signal Beam and Shadow Ball can smack around Uxie and retain coverage on Slowking, but neither has much more use outside of that. Grass Knot can be used to instantly KO Rhydon, but it has little utility over Thunderbolt and Ice Beam otherwise. Rain Dance or Sunny Day are useful if Mesprit is being used on a weather team. Although you can turn the Choice Scarf set physical, this is not recommended due to the lower Base Power of Mesprit's physical moves. Knock Off can remove the Eviolite off of threats such as Ferroseed, Rhydon, and Magneton, though Mesprit generally benefits more from the utility of U-turn and Healing Wish overall. Finally, Mesprit's only form of recovery is RestTalk, but thanks to Mesprit's Pursuit weakness and decent-at-best bulk, it will rarely survive the sleep turns. Moreover, BW's sleep mechanics make RestTalk a poor idea the majority of the time.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to its versatility, it is difficult to outright counter Mesprit before knowing the set it's running. Pursuit users, however, are a safe bet most of the time. Spiritomb can take any of Mesprit's moves and put it in a bad position between Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Escavalier has to worry about Hidden Power Fire and Fire Punch, but it has Megahorn and Pursuit to put Mesprit in a checkmate position. Absol also has Sucker Punch and Pursuit, but it has a harder time switching in than the other aforementioned Pursuit users.</p>

<p>Cryogonal and Clefable can handle special sets lacking Psyshock, but cannot handle the Choice Band set. Magneton and Ferroseed are two good examples of Steel-types that can check Mesprit handily, as they only fear Hidden Power Fire and Fire Punch. Regirock handles any Mesprit set pretty well thanks to its great mixed defenses and lack of weakness to any of Mesprit's moves, although its lack of reliable recovery hinders its ability to continually take hits from Mesprit. Faster Bug- and Ghost-types such as Scolipede, Durant, and Rotom can make short work of Mesprit, but none of them can safely switch into Mesprit. Faster Pokemon such as Entei and Moltres are capable of overpowering Mesprit, but they have difficulties in trying to switch into Mesprit. If all else fails, you can just continually hammer away at Mesprit with powerful attacks. While Mesprit has solid bulk, it lacks reliable recovery, which means it will eventually fold to repeated attacks in the course of the match.</p>
