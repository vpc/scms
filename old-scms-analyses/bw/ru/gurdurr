[Overview]

<p>Gurdurr has all the traits needed of an effective bulky attacker. When boosted by Eviolite, Gurdurr becomes an impressively bulky Pokemon, capable of taking hits from powerful offensive Pokemon such as Absol and Aggron well and allowing it the leniency of switching into and setting up on a variety of physically-inclined offensive Pokemon. Access to Guts also makes crippling Gurdurr with status a much more costly and an ineffective method of handling it, as it can heal a reasonable amount of the HP lost this way with a boosted Drain Punch. Moreover, priority in the form of Mach Punch is icing on the cake, as it allows Gurdurr to mitigate its subpar Speed and check frail or weakened sweepers.</p>

<p>Of course, be it due to inherent flaws or simply the nature of the RU metagame, Gurdurr is hard-pressed to effectively fulfill its desired role without significant support. Despite its rather impressive 105 base Attack stat, the lower Base Power moves that Gurdurr is forced to rely upon make it moderately weak without a boost, leaving it vulnerable both to being walled handily by naturally bulky Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Alomomola, and becoming exploited by dangerous offensive threats such as Moltres and Gallade. Gurdurr's reliance on Eviolite also presents an issue, as it not only makes it substantially more vulnerable to Trick and Spikes than similar bulky attackers of the tier but also isolates Drain Punch as Gurdurr's sole source of recovery, making it noticeably easier to wear down over time. Gurdurr is a very capable and even dangerous Pokemon in the RU metagame, but dedicated support is necessary for it to function to its fullest potential.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gurdurr's solid natural bulk, adequate movepool, and Guts ability make it a very capable user of a simple Bulk Up set. After a Bulk Up, Gurdurr becomes incredibly tough to break through on the physical side; even powerful attacks such as Choice Band Entei's Flare Blitz and Choice Band Druddigon's Outrage fail to 2HKO Gurdurr at full health. However, without any form of recovery, this becomes a moot point, which is why Drain Punch is the most optimal STAB attack for Gurdurr to use, as this allows Gurdurr to mitigate the damage taken while setting up, as well as giving it the flexibility to take hits afterwards and recover a significant amount of HP in return. Overall, ThunderPunch is the most consistently useful coverage move for Gurdurr, as it allows Gurdurr to comfortably beat Qwilfish and defensive variants of Slowking, prevent dangerous Pokemon such as Moltres from switching in for free, and maintains neutral coverage on the majority of the tier. However, Payback is also an effective option, as despite the fact that Gurdurr becomes noticeably more vulnerable to Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Moltres, it does provide Gurdurr with a method of dealing respectable damage to Psychic-types, such as Mesprit and Uxie, as well as preventing it from being completely walled by Golurk and Rotom. Mach Punch is, of course, a staple for Gurdurr, as it allows it to compensate for its low Speed and prevent stronger special attackers, such as Sceptile and Magmortar, from revenge killing it after they have been worn down enough, in addition to allowing Gurdurr to comfortably check Pokemon such as Zangoose, Tauros, and Shell Smash Omastar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Due to the fact that Gurdurr is more or less confined to using Bulk Up, Drain Punch, and Mach Punch, or it risks becoming outclassed by the other Fighting-types of the tier, the only flexibility it retains lies in the coverage move it uses. Ice Punch is one option, as it retains solid neutral coverage alongside Drain Punch and remains Gurdurr's best bet at breaking through Amoonguss, but the trade-off of being significantly more vulnerable to Slowking, Qwilfish, and Moltres is often reason enough to avoid it without a very capable defensive core supporting Gurdurr. On the other hand, Rock Slide allows Gurdurr to retain similarly solid neutral coverage while allowing it to more effectively take on Bug-types and OHKO Moltres on the switch, but it doesn't help Gurdurr overcome any of its more traditional defensive counters.</p>

<p>One of the most important partners to consider for Gurdurr is a Pursuit user; due to the fact that the RU tier shelters a plethora of durable Psychic- and Ghost-types&mdash;all of whom give Gurdurr headaches&mdash;it is nearly mandatory to carry Pursuit support in order to open a window for Gurdurr to sweep. Considering its ability to effectively combat Gallade in addition to other Psychic- and Ghost-types, Spiritomb is often the most optimal teammate for this purpose, but both Absol and Escavalier are also effective in this role if Gallade is already well-covered. However, while most Ghost- and Psychic-types are covered fairly handily by these means, Spiritomb, particularly the defensive set, can prove a difficult obstacle for Gurdurr to overcome, and having teammates to properly capitalize upon it is encouraged; specially based Fire-types, such as Moltres and Magmortar, can comfortably switch into defensive Spiritomb (being immune to Will-O-Wisp and taking minimal damage from Foul Play) and threaten to 2HKO with their STAB attacks, while Roselia can easily set up entry hazards against Spiritomb, recovering the damage it inflicts with Rest. These Pokemon are also very capable of threatening bothersome physical walls, namely Tangrowth and Alomomola, whom impede Gurdurr indefinitely. Slowking makes a quality partner for Gurdurr as well, being capable of stomaching most of the strong specially based attacks aimed at Gurdurr, while in return baiting Dark- and Bug-types for Gurdurr to set up on. Moreover, due to Slowking's versatility as a Pokemon, it is capable of supporting Gurdurr in a variety of ways to benefit the playstyle used, whether it be spreading burns on Psychic-types with Scald, baiting and KOing Tangrowth with Fire Blast, or even opening up a more comfortable sweep for Gurdurr with Trick Room.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Gurdurr retains a reasonable amount of alternative options, both in movepool and ability, the fact that it already receives so much competition from the other Fighting-types of the tier severely restricts it from utilizing these options without becoming outclassed in that role. Iron Fist and Sheer Force both boost a substantial amount of Gurdurr's offensive movepool, but by dropping Guts, wearing down Gurdurr with poison and burn damage becomes a much more low-risk option, which is typically very unhealthy in a metagame as status-heavy as RU. In terms of alternative moves, Gurdurr has the capacity to adequately utilize a SubPunch set, but its lack of Leftovers recovery, in addition to its inability to inflict consistent damage without having a Substitute up, makes it a very inconsistent option. Knock Off, as odd as it is, can capably replace Bulk Up and allow Gurdurr to serve as an effective utility attacker, capable of removing Leftovers recovery from a variety of defensive Pokemon that commonly switch into it, such as Alomomola, Qwilfish, Tangrowth, and Uxie. However, the instances in which this is useful to the point where it is worth forgoing the ability to sweep late-game are few and far-between.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gurdurr's most basic and effective counters are Psychic-types; Pokemon such as Gallade, Mesprit, Sigilyph, and Uxie are capable of switching into Gurdurr fairly comfortably and threatening it immediately with their STAB attacks, making them very solid answers to it as long as they are able to evade Pursuit users. Slowking is somewhat similar, but its low Speed and susceptibility to hazards makes it a much less effective check, as Gurdurr can outpace and 2HKO offensive variants with ThunderPunch after Stealth Rock damage, and defensive variants lacking Psychic are very unlikely to beat Gurdurr if they have to switch into it. Bulky physical walls, such as Alomomola and Tangrowth, are capable of comfortably handling Gurdurr as long as they aren't poisoned or burned, being capable of holding up to its attacks very well and wearing it down with Toxic and/or Leech Seed damage. Similarly, Amoonguss is capable of wearing down and eventually beating any Gurdurr lacking Ice Punch while restricting its ability to boost with the threat of Clear Smog. Depending on the coverage move Gurdurr utilizes, a couple select Pokemon are capable of taking on Gurdurr fairly comfortably; ThunderPunch variants are handled by Golurk and Rotom, Qwilfish checks any Gurdurr lacking ThunderPunch, and Scyther can set up on Payback variants without much trouble. Moltres gets special acknowledgement, as it can switch into any Gurdurr set lacking Rock Slide if Stealth Rock is off the field and proceed to either use the offensive momentum it gains to set up a Substitute or outright OHKO Gurdurr with Hurricane. However, if Stealth Rock is in play, Gurdurr is capable of KOing Moltres on the switch with ThunderPunch, which deters it from switching in entirely freely. However, one of the most prominent methods of handling Gurdurr is simply by wearing it down; Gurdurr's reliance on Drain Punch for recovery can usually be exploited in the effort to take it out, as Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Accelgor can simply whittle Gurdurr down, as it cannot adequately recover HP to the extent that it can realistically sweep afterwards.</p>
