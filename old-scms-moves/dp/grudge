[SHORT DESC]
If the user faints, the foe's attack loses all of its PP.

[LONG DESC]
<p>If the user faints before its next move, the Pokémon that fainted the user will lose all PP in the move they used to KO the user. This does not take into account any end-of-turn damage, such as hail, sandstorm, Leech Seed, status, Doom Desire, or Future Sight. If a Pokemon uses Grudge, switches next turn, and faints to Pursuit as it switches, the Pursuit user loses all Pursuit PP.</p>
